<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on July 11, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 7 月 11 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What happens after death? Many people, of course, wonder and marvel and even anticipate what kind of reality they will face after they leave this world. In fact, the emphasis on this is the foundation for the world’s religions. For somehow it seems too incredible and too unreal to think that this life, with all of your intelligence and capabilities, would cease when your body ceases to function. Somehow, this seems to be a contradiction. It is not merely that it is a fear or an anxiety. It is a contradiction. For you were born with a spark of awareness, and you will leave this world with a spark of awareness.</p>
<p>死后会发生什么？当然，许多人都会好奇、惊叹，甚至期待着离开这个世界后会面临什么样的现实。事实上，对这一点的强调正是世界宗教的基础。因为，当你的身体停止运转时，你所拥有的所有智能和能力的生命也会随之终结，这似乎太不可思议，太不真实了。不知何故，这似乎是一个矛盾。这不仅仅是一种恐惧或焦虑。它本身就是一个矛盾。因为你生来就带着一丝觉知的火花，你离开这个世界时也将带着一丝觉知的火花。</p>
<p>The mystery surrounding this, and the many philosophies and the great speculation that surrounds this, continues to perplex people everywhere. In fact, this is a great concern throughout the Greater Community of life in the universe. It is not a preoccupation for human beings alone.</p>
<p>围绕着这个问题的神秘，以及围绕着这个问题的众多哲学和重大猜测，持续困扰着世界各地的人们。事实上，这是整个宇宙生命大社区的重大关切。它并非仅仅是人类的当务之急。</p>
<p>The contemplation of what might happen after you leave this world is certainly on the minds of people who are facing grave illness, and is certainly on the minds of many people who are reaching the final stages of their life in the world. But it becomes a great emphasis really for everyone, for how you live your life here in large part is determined by how you view your existence overall.</p>
<p>那些面临重病的人，以及许多即将步入人生最后阶段的人，都会思考离开这个世界后会发生什么。但这对每个人来说都至关重要，因为你如何度过你的人生，很大程度上取决于你如何看待你的存在。</p>
<p>If you identify with your body, you will feel as weak and vulnerable as your body. You will fear a thousand things that could harm it or destroy it. You will devote yourself to protecting it, to caring for it, to serving its pleasures and its needs, and to mitigating its pains and its difficulties.</p>
<p>如果你认同你的身体，你就会感到你和你的身体一样软弱无助。你会害怕千百种可能伤害它、摧毁它的事物。你会全身心地保护它、照顾它、满足它的快乐和需求，并减轻它的痛苦和困难。</p>
<p>How you live your life, then, is very much dependent on what you identify with within yourself. Certainly, there is a greater part of you than your body, and that is your mind. That is the mind you think with. It also contains your memories, your feelings and your emotions and associations—everything that has been impressed upon you in this life since the moment you were born. And of course many people—in fact really everyone to a certain degree—identify with this thinking mind and with their own thoughts.</p>
<p>那么，你如何度过你的生命，很大程度上取决于你内在认同的事物。当然，你有一个比你的身体更重要的部分，那就是你的心灵。这是你用来思考的心灵。它也包含你的记忆、你的感受、你的情绪和联想——自你出生那一刻起，此生铭刻在你心的一切。当然，很多人——事实上，在某种程度上，每个人——都认同这个思考的心灵，认同他们自身的思想。</p>
<p>People really do believe they are a nametag. They really do think that their personality—with all of its peculiarities and unique features, its weaknesses, its strengths and its hazards—is who they really are, and that their thoughts really represent who they are. So when you identify with the mind, well, you will feel you have a little bit more omnipotence over the frailty of your body. You will think, “Well, people can hurt my body, but they cannot hurt my mind. I am still free to think my own thoughts.”</p>
<p>人们真的相信他们就是一个名字标签。他们真的认为，他们的个性——包括它所有的怪癖和独特之处，它的弱点、它的优势和它的危险——就是他们真正的自我，他们的思想真正代表了他们真正的自我。因此，当你认同于心灵时，你会感到自己对脆弱的身体拥有了更多一点的全能。你会想：“好吧，人们可以伤害我的身体，但他们无法伤害我的心灵。我仍然可以自由地思考我自身的思想。”</p>
<p>This is a very common assumption, of course, but it unfortunately is untrue because you live in a mental environment, and 99% of your thoughts you have absorbed from your environment or have adopted from your family or other significant figures to meet social conventions, to meet other people’s expectations, to meet the requirements and demands of your family and so forth. Really, you do have very little freedom in your thinking mind because it has been so conditioned into you. You think you are free, but you are not really free in this regard.</p>
<p>当然，这是一个非常普遍的假设，但不幸的是，它并不正确，因为你生活在一个心理环境中，你99%的想法都是从环境中吸收的，或者从你的家人或其他重要人物那里借鉴的，以适应社会习俗、他人的期望、家庭的要求等等。事实上，你的思维模式几乎没有自由，因为它已经被你深深地灌输了。你认为你是自由的，但在这方面你并非真正自由。</p>
<p>So people identify with their thoughts and even more so with their fixed beliefs. People are willing to die for their beliefs, to kill other people for their beliefs, to wage war, to commit genocide, to devastate the world and to denigrate others because they are fixed on their beliefs. They identify with their beliefs. They think their beliefs are who they are. Certainly, everyone suffers from this delusion to one degree or another.</p>
<p>因此，人们认同他们的思想，甚至更认同他们根深蒂固的信念。人们愿意为他们的信念而死，为他们的信仰而杀人，发动战争，进行种族灭绝，毁灭世界，诋毁他人，因为他们固执己见。他们认同他们的信仰。他们认为他们的信仰就是他们是谁。当然，每个人都或多或少地遭受着这种妄想的折磨。</p>
<p>Where would you be without your political ideas or beliefs, religious ideas or beliefs? Or your social standards? Or your expectations? Or your plans and your regimens and your schedules and your habits and your hobbies? Where would you be without all these things? Would you cease to exist? Would you evaporate?</p>
<p>如果没有你的政治理念或信仰、宗教理念或信仰，你会怎样？如果没有你的社会标准、你的期望、你的计划、你的养生之道、你的日程安排、你的习惯和你的爱好，你会怎样？如果没有这一切，你会怎样？你会不复存在吗？你会消失吗？</p>
<p>Many people are very terrified to experience even a moment of stillness, thinking that without this constant investment in their thinking and ideas, feelings and emotions, memories and expectations, they would somehow just disappear, or go crazy, or lose control or some other thing of this nature. And then there are people who believe they have a soul that somehow is beyond their intellect, but it is mysterious. It is hard to attribute to it any aspect of the mind or the body.</p>
<p>许多人甚至害怕体验哪怕片刻的静止，他们认为，如果没有这种持续投入于思考、观念、感受、情绪、记忆和期望之中的宁静，他们就会不知何故消失，或者发疯，或者失去控制，或者出现其他类似的情况。还有一些人相信，他们拥有一个超越智力的灵魂，但它神秘莫测。很难将心灵或身体的任何方面归因于它。</p>
<p>Some people believe they have an ethereal body, a kind of transparent body, because they cannot imagine themselves without having a physical form of some kind. And others think their soul has a lot of ideas and is somehow just another version of their intellect and their social conditioning. But there are many people, fortunately, who recognize that there is something about themselves and other people that is beyond the mind and the body. And this is a hopeful sign.</p>
<p>有些人相信他们拥有一种以太体，一种透明的身体，因为他们无法想象他们自己没有某种物质形态。另一些人则认为他们的灵魂拥有许多想法，某种程度上只是他们智力和社会制约的另一种体现。但幸运的是，许多人认识到，他们自己和他人身上存在着某种超越身心的东西。这是一个充满希望的迹象。</p>
<p>For if you were in a hospital and you could not move, you would have to face your mind because there is very little you could do. Or if you were in a wheelchair and could not function within the normal range of activities, you would have to face the content of your mind to a much greater degree because you could not be running around all day.</p>
<p>因为如果你在医院里，无法动弹，你就必须面对你的心灵，因为你几乎无能为力。或者，如果你坐在轮椅上，无法进行正常的活动，你就必须更大程度地面对你的心灵，因为你无法整天四处奔波。</p>
<p>But then if life disappoints you, if there is a loss of love or privilege, a loss of respect or admiration from other people, this could be shattering to your mind. There are people who commit suicide when their ideas about themselves are seriously challenged or thrown into doubt.</p>
<p>但如果生命让你失望，如果你失去了爱或特权，失去了他人的尊重或钦佩，这可能会让你心碎。有些人会在自我认知受到严重挑战或质疑时选择自杀。</p>
<p>So likely you will face moments—either moments of some kind of prescience or moments of grave disappointment—when you really cannot continue to reinforce your ideas about yourself and stay distracted with your beliefs and your hobbies, your pursuits and your pleasures, for life has thrown a wrench in the works. Life has disrupted your dream, your self-obsession.</p>
<p>所以你很可能会面临这样的时刻——要么是某种预感，要么是极度失望——那时你真的无法继续强化你对你自己的看法，无法再被你的信仰、爱好、追求和快乐所分心，因为生命已经给你的计划设置了障碍。生命已经打乱了你的梦，打乱了你的自我迷恋。</p>
<p>Now you have to face something else within yourself. Perhaps you do not really know who you are. Perhaps your ideas are not so certain. Perhaps your beliefs about God and life and nature and culture and civilization—perhaps they are not as true as you thought they were previously. And now you are in doubt. Now you are not so sure.</p>
<p>现在你必须面对你自己内心深处的某种东西。或许你并不真正知道你是谁。或许你的想法并不那么确定。或许你对上帝、生命、自然、文化和文明的信仰——或许它们并不像你之前认为的那样真实。而现在你心存疑虑。现在你不再那么确定。</p>
<p>People are so fixated and so identified with their thoughts that when they face these moments of self-doubt, it is very shocking. It is like your whole life is thrown into question. Your entire existence is thrown into question. You thought you knew who you were and why you were in the world and what you were about here. Your life was figured out. You had a pattern and a scheme and a blueprint. But now you are not so sure.</p>
<p>人们如此执着，如此认同他们的思想，以至于当他们面对这些自我怀疑的时刻时，会感到非常震惊。就好像你的整个生命都受到了质疑。你的整个存在都受到了质疑。你曾认为你知道你是谁，你为什么来到这个世界，你来此的目的是什么。你的人生早已被规划好了。你曾经拥有一个模式、一个计划和一个蓝图。但现在你不再那么确定了。</p>
<p>This is always a hopeful sign when you have these kinds of experiences, even though people go to great lengths to avoid them and to escape them and to get out of them as quickly as possible. It is these moments that can give you a window into your deeper nature and perhaps give you a glimpse that who you really are is not your mind, your thoughts, your beliefs, your convictions, your associations, your memories, your expectations and all of this.</p>
<p>当你拥有这类体验时，这始终是一个充满希望的迹象，即使人们竭尽全力地回避它们、逃避它们、并尽快摆脱它们。正是这些时刻能为你打开一扇通往你更深层次自然的窗户，或许能让你瞥见你真正的自我，并非你的心灵、你的思想、你的信仰、你的信念、你的联想、你的记忆、你的期望等等。</p>
<p>Moments of great disappointment can be real breakthroughs in this matter. So if you are experiencing great disappointment or great self-doubt, it is a promising moment for you. There might be a chance that you will escape the prison of your mind, the prison of your beliefs and thoughts and convictions.</p>
<p>极度失望的时刻或许能带来真正的突破。所以，如果你正经历着巨大的失望或强烈的自我怀疑，这对你来说是一个充满希望的时刻。你或许有机会逃离你心灵的牢笼，逃离你信仰、思想和信念的牢笼。</p>
<p>Perhaps you will not be so adamant now in asserting your ideas and beliefs, and so ready to condemn others who disagree with you, or who do not live according to your standards or expectations. This is always a hopeful sign that perhaps you will have a chance to have a glimpse or a reminder that you are not your thoughts; you are not your mind.</p>
<p>或许你现在不会那么固执地坚持你的想法和信仰，也不会那么急于谴责那些与你意见相左，或不按你的标准或期望生活的人。这始终是一个充满希望的迹象，或许你将有机会瞥见或得到提醒：你并非你的思想；你并非你的心灵。</p>
<p>There is a greater part of you that is beyond all this. You may call it your soul. You may call it your Being. But beyond that, you cannot really give it much form. You can imagine that it is godlike or ethereal. You can imagine all kinds of things, but really, the mind cannot understand the Spirit.</p>
<p>你身上有一个更伟大的部分超越了这一切。你或许称之为你的灵魂。你或许称之为你的存在。但除此之外，你无法真正赋予它任何形态。你可以想象它如同神明，或如同空灵。你可以想象各种各样的事物，但事实上，心灵无法理解精神。</p>
<p>The mind has to put everything into form, and you just cannot put the Spirit into form. The Spirit can live in form. The Spirit occupies form, as in the case with yourself and your current existence, but you cannot really make the Spirit take form. You can build form around the Spirit. The Spirit can occupy a form, but it is not quite the same, you see.</p>
<p>心灵必须将一切事物转化为形式，而你无法将精神转化为形式。精神可以存在于形式之中。精神占据形式，就像你自己和你当前的存在一样，但你无法真正让精神转化为形式。你可以围绕精神构建形式。精神可以占据某种形式，但你看，这两者并不完全相同。</p>
<p>You cannot turn the Spirit into something it is not. You cannot change what God created even though everyone seems to be trying very hard to do just that.</p>
<p>你无法将精神变成它本不是的样子。你无法改变上帝的创造，尽管每个人似乎都在努力这么做。</p>
<p>The world created your body. Your life in the physical universe has created your mind as you are aware of it. But God created your Spirit. Nature has created your mind and body. God created Nature, but what God really created in you that has permanence is beyond the mind and the body.</p>
<p>世界创造了你的身体。你在物质宇宙中的生命创造了你意识中的心灵。但上帝创造了你的灵魂。自然创造了你的心灵和身体。上帝创造了自然，但上帝真正在你身上创造的、永恒的东西，超越了心灵和身体。</p>
<p>This represents a great leap, a great transition in awareness, a great threshold if you can experience what is being presented here. While you are still living in the world, functioning, living within a body, using your mind to navigate the constantly changing circumstances and the innumerable problems of life, to have this experience of yourself beyond your mind and beyond your body, it is very reassuring. It is a wonderful antidote to all of the fearful obsessions that people are so fixated upon in their fervent religious beliefs, in their hobbies, in their romantic pursuits, in their obsessive work.</p>
<p>如果你能体验这里呈现的一切，这代表着一次巨大的飞跃，一次觉知上的伟大转变，一个伟大的门槛。当你仍然活在世间，运转着，活在身体之中，用你的心灵去应对不断变化的境遇和无数的人生难题时，拥有这种超越心灵和身体的自我体验，会让你感到非常安心。它是一剂绝佳的解药，可以治愈人们在狂热的宗教信仰、爱好、浪漫追求和沉迷的工作中所沉迷的那些令人恐惧的执念。</p>
<p>To see that you exist beyond all these things gives you a kind of deeper confidence and a deeper self-trust. You really cannot trust the body totally because it is so fallible. It is so easily damaged. It is so prone to so many problems. And there is always a chance you could drop dead tomorrow or step in front of a car or have some other calamity take place.</p>
<p>看见你超越了所有这些事物的存在，会赋予你一种更深层次的自信和一种更深层次的自我信任。你真的无法完全信任你的身体，因为它太容易犯错，太容易受损，太容易出现各种问题。而且你永远都有可能明天就突然猝死，或者撞到车前，或者遭遇其他灾难。</p>
<p>You cannot really trust your mind because it is so conflicted and it is permeated with so much fear and anxiety and antagonism. It is really fairly chaotic because it does not have Spirit to guide it, and without the guidance of Spirit, the mind becomes rather erratic. It is prone to all kinds of difficulties and even self-destructive behaviors.</p>
<p>你无法真正信任你的心灵，因为它充满冲突，充斥着如此多的恐惧、焦虑和敌意。它实际上相当混乱，因为它没有精神的指引，而没有精神的指引，心灵就会变得相当反复无常。它很容易陷入各种困境，甚至做出自我毁灭的行为。</p>
<p>The people who are the most balanced, whose inner life is the most harmonious, have established their identity beyond the realm of the intellect. Then they realize their mind is here to serve something. If the mind only serves its own ideas, it becomes erratic and conflicted, and what you see as a result is the world you experience—that humanity can create things of beauty and things of terror, that even with all of this intellectual brilliance, people suffer; they are miserable; they are dishonest; they cannot be with themselves; they cannot be present to other people; they cannot sit still for a minute; they do not know how to be with themselves; they do not know how to be with life; they are limited in their ability to experience beauty. The mind is driven crazy without the guidance of Spirit.</p>
<p>那些内心最平衡、内心最和谐的人，已经超越了智力的范畴，确立了他们的身份。然后，他们意识到，他们的心灵是为了服务于某种事物而存在的。如果心灵只服务于它自身的想法，它就会变得反复无常、充满冲突，结果就是你所体验到的世界——人类可以创造美丽的事物，也可以创造可怕的事物，即使拥有如此丰富的智能，人们仍然在受苦；他们悲惨；他们不诚实；他们无法与他们自己相处；他们无法与他人共处；他们一刻也静不下来；他们不知道如何与他们自己相处；他们不知道如何与生命相处；他们体验美的能力有限。如果没有精神的指引，心灵就会被逼疯。</p>
<p>The mind was made to be a vehicle of communication. That is its greatest purpose. But if this purpose is not experienced, if it is not understood, if it is not really fully being employed in a person’s life, then they are going to be driven crazy by their mind and by the minds of other people. It is a constant racket.</p>
<p>心灵生来就是沟通的载体。这是它最大的目的。但如果没有体验到这个目的，没有理解它，没有在生命中真正充分运用它，那么他们就会被他们的心灵和他人的心灵逼疯。它就像一场持续不断的喧嚣。</p>
<p>Many people just go to drugs to try to escape their own inner antagonism, the hellish state of their mind. People fall into depression. People become obsessive in their habits or hobbies. Mental illness becomes rampant and ever present. If the mind does not serve Spirit, it becomes self-destructive. And even if its self-destructive tendencies are held in check, it seems to know no happiness or fulfillment.</p>
<p>许多人吸毒只是为了逃避他们自身内在的敌意，逃避他们地狱般的心灵状态。人们陷入抑郁，沉迷于他们的习惯或爱好。心理疾病的肆虐，无时无刻不在。如果心灵不服务于精神，就会走向自我毁灭。即使这种自我毁灭的倾向得到控制，它似乎也感受不到幸福或满足。</p>
<p>Who you are is greater than this, and that will tell you that your existence will continue beyond this life because if who you are is not your mind and your body, then the cessation of your body, and even the cessation of your mind as you experience it, does not constitute the end of your existence.</p>
<p>你是谁比这更伟大，这将告诉你，你的存在将在今生之后继续，因为如果你是谁不是你的心灵和你的身体，那么你身体的终结，甚至你所体验到的你的心灵的终结，并不构成你存在的终结。</p>
<p>So when We come to the question of what happens after death, how you will see this and understand this is dependent greatly on what you think you are and what you identify with. If you think you are only a body, well, death is it. It is over. You are like a cup of water that is sent back into the ocean. Your molecules just become part of the molecules of the universe to become something else—a tree or a rock or part of another creature, whatever, throughout time. You were just part of the material of the physical universe.</p>
<p>因此，当我们谈到死后会发生什么时，你会如何看待和理解它，很大程度上取决于你认为你是什么，以及你认同什么。如果你认为你只是一具身体，那么，死亡就是一切。一切都结束了。你就像一杯水，被送回大海。你的分子只是成为宇宙分子的一部分，最终变成其他事物——一棵树，一块石头，或者其他生物的一部分，无论是什么，在时间的长河中。你只是物质宇宙物质的一部分。</p>
<p>If you identify with your mind and your thoughts, then you will try to create a Heaven where your intellect can survive and be relevant. Let’s see. People have thought up all kinds of heavenly states, but none of them seems to be very attractive. You cannot sit around praising God all day long. You cannot enjoy pleasure for very long without it becoming rather gross and disgusting. If you live a life of total ease and beauty, it becomes exceedingly boring for the intellect.</p>
<p>如果你认同你的心灵和思想，你就会试图创造一个你的智力能够生存并发挥作用的天堂。让我们来看看。人们设想过各种各样的天堂状态，但似乎没有一个很有吸引力。你不可能整天坐着赞美上帝。你不可能长时间享受快乐，否则它会变得相当粗俗和令人厌恶。如果你过着完全轻松美好的生活，对智力来说，它会变得极其无聊。</p>
<p>All these notions of Heaven where you still have a mind and your body become, after a time, rather hellish. For what is Hell but a beautiful place where you can never be happy? And the kind of Heaven that people imagine where their intellect and their body can survive really becomes like Hell after awhile.</p>
<p>所有这些关于天堂的概念，在天堂中，你仍然拥有一个心灵和身体，过了一段时间，就会变成地狱。地狱不过是一个你永远无法快乐的美丽地方，地狱又能是什么呢？人们想象中的那种他们的智力和身体能够生存的天堂，过了一段时间，真的会变成地狱。</p>
<p>Some people think you just melt back into God, but really that is annihilation. That is like putting a cup of water back in the ocean. And somehow there is no relevance there for yourself if you think you are just an intellect and a body. Even if God is wonderful, most people will not really welcome annihilation.</p>
<p>有些人认为你只是融入了上帝，但实际上那是一种毁灭。它就像把一杯水放回大海。如果你认为你自己只是一种智力和一具身体，那么这对你来说毫无意义。即使上帝是伟大的，大多数人也不会真正欢迎毁灭。</p>
<p>So to approach this question of what happens after death is really dependent upon how you view yourself and what you identify with. There are many people who absolutely cannot face the prospect of not having a body. It just would be inconceivable to just be a mind, in some kind of void existence, without any contrast, without any scenery?</p>
<p>所以，要回答死后会发生什么这个问题，实际上取决于你如何看待你自己，以及你认同什么。很多人根本无法面对失去身体的现实。仅仅拥有一个心灵，处于某种虚空的存在中，没有任何对比，没有任何风景，这简直不可思议。</p>
<p>If you were in a physical reality without a body, well, it becomes rather frustrating because you cannot participate. You talk to people, but they cannot hear you. You wave at people, but they do not notice. You yell and scream at your loved ones to tell them not to do something they are about to do, and they pay you no attention.</p>
<p>如果你身处一个没有身体的物质现实，那会相当令人沮丧，因为你无法参与其中。你和别人说话，但他们听不见。你向别人挥手，但他们却毫无动静。你对着你爱的人大喊大叫，告诉他们不要做他们即将要做的事情，但他们却毫不理会。</p>
<p>That is why when people leave this body, or die, they are taken away from their loved ones because it would be so incredibly painful for them and frustrating to be around their loved ones and be unable to communicate. They are only given brief periods of “visitation.”</p>
<p>这就是为什么当人们离开这个身体，或者去世时，他们会被带离亲人，因为在无法沟通的情况下与亲人相处会让他们无比痛苦和沮丧。他们只有短暂的“探视”时间。</p>
<p>Can you imagine the frustration that if you died and your wife remarried, would you want to be present for their marriage, for their lovemaking, for their romance? Would you want to stick around and see your children fail and have grave difficulty and be absolutely unable to communicate with them, to warn them, to advise them?</p>
<p>你能想象那种沮丧吗？如果你去世了，妻子再婚了，你还想见证他们的婚姻、他们的性爱、他们的浪漫吗？你还想眼睁睁地看着你的孩子失败、经历巨大的困境，却完全无法与他们沟通、警告他们、给他们建议吗？</p>
<p>That is why when someone dies, they are taken away from their loved ones, for their experience and existence would be far too painful and exasperating if this did not occur. There are some relationships where a connection may be sustained, but even here it is intermittent.</p>
<p>这就是为什么当一个人去世时，他们会被带离亲人，因为如果没有亲人，他们的经历和存在将会过于痛苦和令人恼火。有些关系或许能够维系，但即使如此，这种联系也是断断续续的。</p>
<p>When you die, you lose your physical vehicle. It has served its purpose, or it was prematurely destroyed, whatever the case may be. You died young. You died old. Your body is a temporary vehicle. It gets worn out. It gets injured. It gets sick. It gets destroyed in conflict. You made the mistake of stepping in front of the car, or you were not paying attention, and you hit the tree.</p>
<p>当你死去时，你就失去了你的物质载体。它要么完成了使命，要么过早地被摧毁了，无论哪种情况。你英年早逝。你年老而死。你的身体只是一辆临时的载体。它会磨损。它会受伤。它会生病。它会在冲突中被摧毁。你犯了一个错误，走到了车前，或者你没有注意，撞到了树上。</p>
<p>People seem to think that they die at some kind of perfect time, like they are finished with life, but that is not true at all. Anything can happen to you at any moment. That is why you must pay attention and be present to what you are doing.</p>
<p>人们似乎认为他们会在某个完美的时刻死去，仿佛生命就此终结，但这根本不是真的。任何事情都可能随时发生。所以你必须关注你正在做的事情，并保持在场。</p>
<p>People think, “Oh, well, this person was ready to pass on.” That is ridiculous. Very few people are ready to pass on. Older people, yes. People who have had long illnesses, yes. People whose lives have become so miserable that they are not worth living, yes. But most people die when they die. They are not ready to die. They just die. Either life overtakes them, or their body wears out, or they make some foolish mistake, and that is it.</p>
<p>人们会想：“哦，好吧，这个人已经准备好离开人世了。”这太荒谬了。很少有人真的准备好离开人世。老年人是的。长期患病的人是的。生命变得如此悲惨，以至于不值得活下去的人是的。但大多数人死的时候就死了。他们还没准备好死。他们就这样死了。要么是生命超越了他们，要么是他们的身体衰弱，要么是他们犯了一些愚蠢的错误，仅此而已。</p>
<p>So there you are. You do not have a body. But you still have a mind—for awhile. But it is a different kind of state of mind, you see, because without the body, the mind is not functioning in the same capacity. So much of your mind is taken up with managing the body and directing the body, and this involves plans and activities, memories. A great deal of your mental abilities and your mental energy is taken up with managing the body and planning for the body’s actions.</p>
<p>因此，你也是如此。你没有了身体。但你仍然拥有心灵——至少在一段时间内。但你看，这是一种不同的心灵状态，因为没有身体，心灵就无法以同样的能力运作。你的大部分心灵都被用来管理、指挥身体，这涉及到计划、活动和记忆。你大量的心理能力和心理能量都被用来管理身体和规划身体的行动。</p>
<p>When you do not have a body, a large part of the intellect goes with it. Are you still thinking about what you are going to do next week or what you did the week before, without a body? Are you still concerned about your activities and your engagements with other people and all of your plans? No body, no activities. No activities, no plans. But you are still there.</p>
<p>当你失去身体时，很大一部分智力也会随之消失。没有了身体，你还会思考下周要做什么，或者上周做了什么吗？你还会关心你的活动、与他人的交往以及你所有的计划吗？没有身体，就没有活动。没有活动，就没有计划。但你依然存在。</p>
<p>You will be able to glimpse your life, perhaps momentarily, after you leave it, but then you will have to pass into another dimension. And in this dimension, depending on your state of mind when you died, depending upon your awareness of your life beyond your mind and your body, you may or may not have an encounter with a member of your Spiritual Family.</p>
<p>在你离开之后，你或许能够瞥见你的生命，或许只是短暂的一瞬，但之后你将不得不进入另一个维度。而在这个维度，根据你去世时的心灵状态，根据你对超越心灵和身体的生命的觉知，你或许会，也或许不会，与你精神家庭的某个成员相遇。</p>
<p>When people die in a state of profound ignorance or hatred or violence, they do not have this contact, consciously. They are sent into a kind of limbo state, out of time, where nothing seems to be happening. And then they are given another assignment, but they do not experience that. They just go into another kind of existence because they have not completed their learning mission in the physical reality.</p>
<p>当人们在极度无知、仇恨或暴力的状态下死去时，他们意识上无法与此产生联系。他们被送入一种超越时间的、仿佛一切都静止的、悬而未决的状态。然后他们被赋予了新的任务，但他们却没有体验到。他们只是进入了另一种存在，因为他们尚未完成在物质现实中的学习使命。</p>
<p>You cannot go back to God because your mind and your experience are not yet ready for that. And God does not wave a wand over you and dissolve all of your conflicts and difficulties. For you still have a mind, and it still is full of difficulties, so you are not ready to go back to Heaven or to enter a greater state of existence.</p>
<p>你无法回到上帝身边，因为你的心灵和你的经验尚未为此做好准备。上帝不会挥动魔杖，化解你所有的冲突和困难。因为你仍然拥有心灵，它仍然充满着困难，所以你还没有准备好回到天堂，或者进入一个更伟大的存在状态。</p>
<p>So there is no Judgment Day here where you go before the great judge, and your life is evaluated, and if you are good, you get to pass through and go to Heaven, and if you are bad, you are sent down below into some hellish or terrible state. That is a complete fantasy. That is used by religious institutions to make people obedient, or to scare them into good behavior or to threaten them with punishment—endless punishment in some cases. But that is not what happens at all. People who think like that must think of God as a really terrible Being! Fierce! Cruel!</p>
<p>所以这里不存在审判日，你不会去到伟大的法官面前，你的人生会被评判，如果你行善，你就能进入天堂；如果你行恶，你就会被打入地狱或进入可怕的境地。那完全是幻想。宗教机构会利用这种幻想来让人们顺从，或者恐吓他们，让他们乖乖听话，或者用惩罚来威胁他们——在某些情况下，惩罚是无休止的。但事实并非如此。有这种想法的人一定认为上帝是一位极其可怕的存在！凶猛！残酷！</p>
<p>Why would God punish you when you were placed in a world where making mistakes was so easy, and the chance of becoming wise was so slim? God understands that without Knowledge to guide you, the deeper intelligence that God has placed within you and created within you, all you could do [is] commit errors.</p>
<p>当你身处一个犯错如此容易、变得明智的机会如此渺茫的世界时，上帝为何要惩罚你？上帝理解，如果没有内识来指引你，没有上帝放置在你内在并在你内在创造的更深层次的智能时，你所能做的就只有犯错。</p>
<p>So would God punish you if you failed to recognize and experience this guiding power and presence in your life? That would be like punishing a child for being a child or punishing a fool for being a fool. Without Knowledge to guide you, this deeper intelligence that God has created, well, all you could do is make mistakes.</p>
<p>那么，如果你未能认出并体验到你生命中这股指引的力量和存在，上帝会惩罚你吗？这就像因为孩子是孩子而惩罚孩子，或者因为傻瓜是傻瓜而惩罚傻瓜。如果没有内识来指引你，没有上帝创造的这种更深层次的智能，那么你所能做的就只有犯错。</p>
<p>So this idea of good behavior, bad behavior, well, if you really did terrible things in life, you would be sent into another kind of existence to try to make amends for that, to rehabilitate the part of your mind that is beyond the intellect. You carry this mind beyond physical life to a certain degree. Only it loses a lot of its thoughts and preoccupations because when you do not have a body, why have preoccupations? When you are outside the physical realm, 90% of your thinking is just irrelevant and has no context.</p>
<p>因此，这种关于好行为、坏行为的想法，嗯，如果你在生前真的做了可怕的事情，你就会被送入另一种存在，试图弥补过错，修复你超越智力的那部分心智。你的心灵在一定程度上超越了物质生命。只是它会失去很多想法和执念，因为当你没有身体时，为什么还要执念呢？当你脱离物质世界时，你90%的思维都是无关紧要的，没有背景。</p>
<p>If you were violent and ignorant, if you died in a violent way or you were angry at God, or you were just very, very conflicted, you would be assigned a different existence, probably within the same world, but in some cases, you might be sent somewhere else in the universe.</p>
<p>如果你暴力又无知，如果你死于暴力，或者你对上帝感到愤怒，或者你只是非常非常矛盾，你就会被分配到一个不同的存在，可能在同一个世界，但在某些情况下，你可能会被送到宇宙的其他地方。</p>
<p>If you died in a greater state of equanimity and self-acceptance, then it is extremely likely you will meet a member of your Spiritual Family, and you will awaken in their presence, and you will be like, “Wow! Where have I been?” And you will all recognize each other even though you will not have form.</p>
<p>如果你在更加平静和自我接受的状态下去世，那么你极有可能遇到你的精神家庭成员，你会在他们面前醒来，你会说：“哇！我去哪儿了？”即使你没有形体，你也会认出彼此。</p>
<p>It will be like waking up from a long and troubled sleep. You will be back where you were before, in an entirely different kind of realm. But it is not yet Heaven. It is not really a higher state yet. Your Spiritual Family that is watching over you in this world will greet you if you leave this world in a state of acceptance and in a state of openness. And if you have lived a life that is not extremely violent or conflicted, you will have the honor and the pleasure of rejoining your learning group, whom you have been with for a long time. And they will give you the chance to choose what you want to do to continue your service to life in the physical universe because you will have the perfect Knowledge that that is what you must do.</p>
<p>它就像从一场漫长而不安的沉睡中醒来。你将回到你之前所在的地方，在一个完全不同的境界。但这还不是天堂。这还不是一个真正的更高境界。如果你以一种接纳和开放的状态离开这个世界，那么在这个世界上守护着你的精神家庭将会欢迎你。如果你的人生并非充满暴力或冲突，你将拥有重新加入你长期共事的学习小组的荣幸和喜悦。他们将给予你机会，选择你想做什么，以继续你对物质宇宙生命的服务，因为你将拥有完美的内识，知道那是你必须做的。</p>
<p>This ability to choose is important because it will give you a greater opportunity for Self-Knowledge in your next experience of living in the physical reality. And you may have a much greater assignment with greater possibilities. If you are not trying to make amends now, you can be assigned a greater task, a greater opportunity.</p>
<p>这种选择能力非常重要，因为它会给你在下一次物质现实生活体验中，获得自我认知的更伟大机会。而且，你可能会面临更艰巨的任务，拥有更伟大的可能性。如果你现在不试图弥补过错，你将被赋予更艰巨的任务，一个更伟大的机会。</p>
<p>This is determined both by you and by your Spiritual Family. It is guided by the Angelic Presence. It is a reality you can hardly imagine now, so do not try to give it form. We are speaking of a profound experience here, not a landscape.</p>
<p>这由你和你的精神家庭共同决定。它由天使存在指引。这是一个你现在难以想象的现实，所以不要试图赋予它形态。我们在此谈论的是一种深刻的体验，而非一幅风景。</p>
<p>Everyone will return to Heaven eventually, but it could take an incredibly long time and a great deal of suffering to get there. Yet do not think this represents the notion of karma as people often think of it. People use karma to justify the wretched conditions of so many people in the world, thinking that “Well, they were bad in their last life, so they get to have this life as a punishment.” That is not the case at all. That becomes a form of cruel justification.</p>
<p>每个人最终都会回到天堂，但这可能需要极其漫长的时间和巨大的苦难才能到达那里。然而，不要认为这代表了人们通常认为的业力概念。人们用业力来为世界上如此多的人的悲惨境遇辩护，认为“好吧，他们前世作恶，所以今生受罚。” 事实并非如此。这成为了一种残酷的辩护。</p>
<p>When you come into the world, you have to deal with the world. You may come into a set of very bad circumstances. It has nothing to do with whether you were good or bad in your last experience of life. It is not a punishment. If you have achieved a certain degree of development and spiritual wellness, it may be a choice. How many saints have arisen from the slums and the wretched conditions of humanity? Poverty is a better breeding ground for sainthood than wealth and affluence.</p>
<p>来到这个世界，你就得与这个世界打交道。你可能会遭遇一系列非常糟糕的境遇。这与你过去的生命经历是好是坏无关。这不是惩罚。如果你已经达到了一定程度的发展和精神上的健康，这或许是一种选择。有多少圣人从贫民窟和人类的悲惨境遇中崛起？贫困比财富和富足更能滋生圣人。</p>
<p>So you must set aside these notions that one life is a payment for the life before. It is really not like that, you see. It is only partially true in the sense that if you did not serve others in one life, you will be put in a position where you can serve others in another. But that does not mean you are thrown into horrid conditions and brutally treated, though you may choose this as an opportunity.</p>
<p>所以你必须摒弃那些认为今生是前世的代价的观念。你看，事实并非如此。它只是部分正确，因为你如果前世没有服务他人，那么来世你就能服务他人。但这并不意味着你会被扔进可怕的环境，遭受残酷的对待，尽管你可以选择将其视为一个机会。</p>
<p>But when you enter physical existence, the memory of your Ancient Home and your Spiritual Family is replaced now, not eradicated but replaced, by your experience of the difficulty of being in physical existence. This begins to overlay a whole new layer of awareness and understanding over that which is fundamental and eternal to you.</p>
<p>但当你进入物质存在时，你古老家园和精神家庭的记忆现在就被你对物质存在困境的体验所取代，不是被根除，而是被取代。这开始在你那根本而永恒的内识之上覆盖一层全新的觉知和理解。</p>
<p>If you were a really bad person and did terrible things, well, maybe you will, you know, be a servant, or a nurse, or a caretaker until such time as the wounds of your prior existence are healed and compensated for. But you are not punished, you see. It is different than that.</p>
<p>如果你真的是一个坏人，做了可怕的事情，那么，也许你会去做个仆人、护士或看护，直到你之前所受的伤害痊愈并得到补偿。但你明白吗，你不会受到惩罚。这和惩罚是两码事。</p>
<p>There are many Beings who are waiting to come into physical existence and are choosing conditions that you here on earth would not want to choose for yourself because they recognize that the opportunity for them to claim their Spiritual Heritage, to recall their Spiritual Family while they are in the world, would be more optimum in those environments.</p>
<p>有许多众生正在等待着来到物质世界，他们所选择的条件是你们地球上的你自己不愿意选择的，因为他们认识到，在那些环境中，他们获得精神传承、在世时回忆起精神家庭的机会会更加理想。</p>
<p>For if you are born into wealth and comfort and splendor, the seduction of all those things is so great that it represents a real disadvantage to a person who wants to come into the world to bring their true spiritual gifts to light.</p>
<p>因为如果你生来就拥有财富、舒适和辉煌，那么所有这些东西的诱惑是如此之大，以至于对于一个想要来到这个世界，将他们的真正精神礼物带到光明中的人来说，这是一种真正的劣势。</p>
<p>The wealthy are far more deluded than the poor. They are far more distracted. They are far more seduced. They have far greater attachments to things of little value than do the poor. So many people choose poverty as a greater opportunity. This does not justify poverty, for poverty is still extremely difficult and even horrible in many cases. So there is no justification here for the state of people’s existence in life.</p>
<p>富人比穷人更容易受迷惑。他们更容易分心。他们更容易受诱惑。他们对低价值之物的执着远比穷人强烈。许多人选择贫困，将其视为一个更伟大的机会。但这并不能为贫困辩护，因为贫困在很多情况下仍然极其艰难，甚至可怕。因此，人们的生存状态在这里毫无正当性可言。</p>
<p>But the spiritual work goes on everywhere—within the ranks of the rich, within the ranks of those who want to be rich, within the ranks of those who are poor, and even within the ranks of those who are desperate. The spiritual work goes on everywhere.</p>
<p>但精神工作无处不在——在富人的行列中，在渴望致富的人的行列中，在贫穷的人的行列中，甚至在绝望的人的行列中。精神工作无处不在。</p>
<p>This is why people who are generally poorer are more religious than those who are generally richer because they feel the importance of it. They recognize the limits of their physical existence. They are more reliant upon spiritual power within themselves. Perhaps they are more superstitious, but they are also more reverent as a whole.</p>
<p>这就是为什么贫困人口通常比富裕人口更虔诚，因为他们感受到宗教的重要性。他们认识到他们物质存在的局限性。他们更依赖他们自己内在的精神力量。或许他们更迷信，但总体而言，他们也更虔诚。</p>
<p>Therefore, when you leave this world, you leave the body behind and you leave a great deal of your thoughts and thinking, plans, goals, schemes and attitudes that all go with the body because you have no context for them now. But you still have a mind. You still have a worldly mind.</p>
<p>因此，当你离开这个世界时，你会离开你的身体，也会离开你的许多想法、思维、计划、目标、方案和态度，所有这些都会随着你的身体而去，因为你现在没有了它们的背景。但你仍然拥有一个心灵。你仍然有一颗世俗的心灵。</p>
<p>If you enter into this phase and this greater state of awareness with a minimum of discord and conflict, you will encounter your Spiritual Family, who will give you your next assignment, which may happen within the same world or somewhere else within the Greater Community of life in the universe. Generally, people return to the same world, but this is not always the case.</p>
<p>如果你带着最少的不和谐和冲突进入这个阶段和这个更伟大的觉知状态，你将会遇到你的精神家庭，他们会赋予你下一个任务，这任务可能发生在同一个世界，也可能发生在宇宙生命大社区的某个地方。通常，人们会回到同一个世界，但这并非总是如此。</p>
<p>Once you are complete being in physical reality, then this mind that keeps you connected to life at this level is no longer part of your experience. Now you are functioning at the level of pure Knowledge, and your individuality becomes a light in the universe.</p>
<p>一旦你完全融入物质现实，那么，让你与生命在这个层面上保持联接的心灵就不再是你体验的一部分。现在，你在纯粹内识的层面上运作，你的个体性成为宇宙中的一束光。</p>
<p>Now you shine like a star and do not float like a pebble. Then the need to enter form, the need to go through change, the need to make amends, even the need to make specific contributions, is outgrown. And you are able to enter into the greater panorama of Creation that is beyond the physical reality.</p>
<p>现在，你不再像鹅卵石般飘浮，而是像一颗星星般闪耀。进入形态的需要，经历改变的需要，弥补过失的需要，甚至做出具体贡献的需要，都已超越。你将能够进入超越物质现实的更广阔的创造全景。</p>
<p>You cannot imagine this now, and perhaps it does not look even desirable to you because it is not where you are in your progression, in your advancement. It is not relevant to your needs at this moment. It is like telling a six-year-old the benefits of being 35. Well, the six-year-old may think it would be fun to drive a car or to have other kinds of liberties, but really it would be beyond their realm and their reach. So when We talk about life beyond the physical reality, it is really beyond your realm and your reach. You are only six, and We are talking about someone who is 35, using that analogy, of course.</p>
<p>你现在无法想象这一点，或许你甚至觉得它并不值得向往，因为它不在你的发展阶段，不在你的进步阶段。它与你此刻的需求无关。它就像告诉一个六岁的孩子35岁的益处。好吧，这个六岁的孩子可能觉得开车或拥有其他类型的自由很有趣，但实际上，这超出了他们的范围和能力。所以，当我们谈论超越物质现实的生命时，它实际上超出了你的范围和能力。你只有六岁，而我们谈论的是一个35岁的人，当然，是用这个比喻。</p>
<p>People are afraid to die, of course, and nature has put this fear in you so that people will hopefully not act foolishly and end their lives prematurely before they have a chance to really do anything here. If you are going to make a difference in life, then your will to live has to be stronger than your will to die, and that is a good thing. Things were designed that way, you see. Otherwise, people would just give up—life gets hard and they just give up.</p>
<p>当然，人们害怕死亡，大自然赋予了这种恐惧，希望人们不会做出愚蠢的行为，在有机会真正有所作为之前就过早结束生命。如果你想改变生命，那么你求生的意志必须强于求死的意志，这是一件好事。你看，一切本来就是这样设计的。否则，人们就会放弃——生命变得艰难，他们就会放弃。</p>
<p>You cannot do that. You have to be here. This is where you are meant to be. This is why you are here, to make a unique contribution to life, at this time, under these circumstances. For this redeems you, and this contributes to the evolution and the well-being of life in the universe.</p>
<p>你不能那样做。你必须在这里。这是你注定要来的地方。这就是你来到这里的原因，在此时此刻，在这样的境况下，为生命做出独特的贡献。因为这救赎了你，也贡献了宇宙中生命的进化和福祉。</p>
<p>Once you realize you have a life beyond your mind and your body, you will begin to experience that you are in the world for a purpose, and this purpose holds the greatest meaning for your existence, and also the reason why you are searching for relationships. It represents, clearly, the deeper motivations that are behind all the things that you seek and do in your life.</p>
<p>一旦你意识到，你的生命超越了你的心灵和身体，你就会开始体验到，你来到这个世界是为了一个目的，而这个目的赋予了你存在的最大意义，也是你追寻关系的原因。它清晰地代表了你在生命中寻求和所做的一切背后的更深层次的动机。</p>
<p>This is the journey before you now. This is why God has presented the Steps to Knowledge. This is why there is a New Message for humanity in the world. This is why there is now a great clarification, for humanity must unite to a greater degree to face the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world and its future within a Greater Community of intelligent life.</p>
<p>这就是现在你面前的旅程。正因如此，上帝呈现了内识进阶。正因如此，世界上有了给人类的一条新讯息。正因如此，现在有一个伟大的澄清，因为人类必须在一个智能生命大社区里，更大程度地团结起来，去面对正在降临世界及其未来的变革巨浪。</p>
<p>Therefore, your understanding of spirituality and religion; your understanding of life; your understanding of your own real purpose, meaning and direction must be greatly clarified to you now. And that which is true in all the world’s religions must be emphasized now, which is that you are sent into the world for a purpose, and this life is an opportunity for you to experience and to express that purpose, and this purpose is not something that you create, but that you must create a life that will allow this purpose to emerge within your awareness, and that you are here to serve a world in need and thus be served in return.</p>
<p>因此，你对精神性和宗教的理解；你对生命的理解；你对你自身真正的目的、意义和方向的理解，现在必须得到极大的澄清。世界上所有宗教中都存在的真理现在必须被强调，那就是你为了某个目的被派到世界上，这次生命是你体验和表达这个目的的一个机会，这个目的并非你创造的某种东西，而是你必须创造一种生命，让这个目的在你的觉知中呈现，你来此是为了服务一个需要的世界，并因此得到服务。</p>
<p>You have come from death to here. Death is both the beginning and an ending, but it is only a stage of your great existence and your great service to life.</p>
<p>你已从死亡来到这里。死亡既是开始，也是结束，但它只是你伟大存在、以及你对生命的伟大服务的一个阶段。</p>
<p>Think of these things. Contemplate them. But realize that your intellect cannot fully understand this, for the intellect cannot really understand the Spirit. It can only serve the Spirit, and that is its great purpose and its great duty.</p>
<p>思考这些事，深思它们。但要意识到，你的智力无法完全理解这一点，因为智力无法真正理解精神。它只能服务于精神，这是它伟大的目的和它伟大的职责。</p>
<p>But do know that your life is greater than this one existence, and that who you are is beyond the mind and the intellect and the body. And you open a door then to a greater experience and a greater certainty and a greater power that are yours to receive and to contribute to the world around you.</p>
<p>但务必知晓，你的生命远比这个生命更伟大，你是谁超越了心灵、智力和身体。如此一来，你便打开了一扇通往更伟大体验、更伟大确定性和更伟大力量的大门，你将拥有这些，并将它们贡献给你周围的世界。</p>
