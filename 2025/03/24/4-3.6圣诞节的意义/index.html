<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on December 23, 1994 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1994 年 12 月 23 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christmas represents the emergence of Knowledge in the individual. This is exemplified in the life of Jesus when, beyond his own understanding even, a Greater Power emerged within him, overtook his life, united him with the Unseen Ones who guided him and led to the expression of his great and significant ministry.</p>
<p>圣诞节代表着个人内识的出现。耶稣的一生就是一个例证，他内心出现了一种更强大的力量，甚至超出了他自身的理解范围，掌控了他的生命，将他与那些引导他并引导他实现伟大而有意义的使命的不可见者联系在一起。</p>
<p>His demonstration, then, though greatly misunderstood and misappropriated, remains today as a symbol of the emergence of Knowledge within the individual. Though Jesus has been idealized, though his life has been made to be unique and unmatched by any other life, though he has been placed on a pedestal above and beyond every other person, in truth, his life represents the emergence of Knowledge within the individual.</p>
<p>因此，尽管他的示范被严重误解和滥用，但今天仍然是个人内在内识浮现的象征。尽管耶稣被理想化了，尽管他的生命被塑造得独一无二，无人能及，尽管他被置于高于其他任何人的神坛上，但事实上，他的生命代表着个人内在内识的浮现。</p>
<p>This emergence is possible for you and represents your greater destiny and your higher purpose in life. This is not to say that your demonstration will be equivalent to that of Jesus’s, for he was an extraordinary individual, and his demonstration was unique.</p>
<p>这种出现对你来说是可能的，它代表着你更伟大的天命和你生命中更高的宗旨。这并不是说你的表现会与耶稣的表现相同，因为他是一个非凡的人，他的表现是独一无二的。</p>
<p>But your demonstration will be unique as well, though certainly not as visible as his. And as he was part of a Greater Order, the expression of Knowledge within you will unite you with a Greater Order as well.</p>
<p>但你的表现也将是独一无二的，尽管肯定不如他的那么引人注目。而且由于他是更伟大秩序的一部分，你内在内识的表达也将使你与更伟大秩序团结在一起。</p>
<p>You are not, then, to compare your life with his, but to learn of the meaning of Knowledge, the greater spiritual power within you, and how it relates to life around you and to the greater spiritual forces who are at work in the world, who were at work in the world at his time and who are at work in the world today.</p>
<p>因此，你不是要将你的生命与他的生命进行比较，而是要学习内识的意义，你内在的更伟大精神力量，以及它如何与你周围的生命以及与正在世界上工作的、在他的时代在世界上工作的和正在当今世界上工作的更伟大精神力量相关。</p>
<p>Jesus is now amongst the Unseen Ones, who guided, counseled and comforted him in his time as a person on Earth. Now he is part of their greater association. Now it is your time on Earth. Your demonstration will be different from his because you live in a different era, in a different kind of world. Though many of the human problems which were evident then are still evident, humanity is now facing the reality of the Greater Community and the necessity and the difficulty of becoming a one-world community.</p>
<p>耶稣现在身处不可见者之中，在他作为人类在地球上时，不可见者曾指导、劝告和安慰过他。现在他是他们更伟大团体的一部分。现在是你在地球上的时候。你的表现将与他不同，因为你生活在不同的时代，不同的世界。尽管当时显而易见的许多人类问题仍然显而易见，但人类现在正面临着大社区的现实，以及成为一个世界大社区的必要性和困难。</p>
<p>Jesus did not have to address these problems in his time, and therefore his ministry was different, meeting the needs and the evolutionary development of his time. But now you must meet the needs and the evolutionary development of your time.</p>
<p>耶稣在那个时代不需要解决这些问题，因此他的事工与众不同，满足了那个时代的需求和进化发展。但现在你必须满足你所在时代的需要和进化发展。</p>
<p>You cannot do this based upon the strength of your ideas. You cannot do this by being an adamant person. You cannot do this by rebelling against society or by attacking its institutions. You can only do it with Knowledge, and you can only do it with the power of the Unseen Ones, who will come to assist you as Knowledge begins to emerge within you.</p>
<p>你无法基于你的想法的力量做到这一点。你无法通过成为一个固执的人做到这一点。你无法通过反抗社会或攻击其机构做到这一点。你只能凭借内识做到这一点，你只能凭借不可见者的力量做到这一点，当内识开始在你内在呈现时，他们将来协助你。</p>
<p>Only Knowledge has the strength to move other minds. Only Knowledge has the potency to create a lasting impact. Only Knowledge can foster good and good intentions. Only Knowledge can counteract fear and hostility. Only Knowledge can bless the world.</p>
<p>只有内识才有力量推动他人的心灵。只有内识才有能力创造持久的影响。只有内识才能培养善良和善意。只有内识才能消除恐惧和敌意。只有内识才能祝福世界。</p>
<p>Your promise, then, is to become a man or a woman of Knowledge—a vehicle for Knowledge; a person through which Knowledge can speak, act and move; a bringer of Grace, but also a person of action, who can effect change, but with a greater spirit; who can speak the truth, but with a greater authority; who can reveal error, but with a greater compassion. Only Knowledge within you can do this, and it is the source of these great expressions.</p>
<p>那么，你的承诺就是成为一个拥有内识的男人或女人——一个内识的载体；一个内识能够通过其说话、行动和移动的人；一个恩典的带来者，同时也是一个行动者，能够影响改变，但带着一种更伟大的精神；能够说出真理，但带着更伟大的权威；能够揭示错误，但带着更伟大的同情心。只有你内在的内识能够做到这一点，它是这些伟大表达的源泉。</p>
<p>Therefore, this is your Christmas now. It is not simply a commemorative holiday. It is not simply a remembrance of Jesus. It is not simply a remembrance of family and friends. It is not simply a time to give gifts and to be giving for a few days out of the year.</p>
<p>因此，现在这就是你们的圣诞节。它不仅仅是一个纪念性的节日。它不仅仅是对耶稣的纪念。它不仅仅是对家人和朋友的纪念。它不仅仅是一年中几天赠送礼物和奉献的时间。</p>
<p>Though it may include all of these things, the meaning of Christmas is greater. Let it be greater for you. Let it be a time, then, that you remember that you have a greater purpose in the world and that you have been sent into the world to reclaim this purpose—to accept it, to experience it and to follow it so that it may be contributed.</p>
<p>尽管圣诞节可能包括所有这些事情，但其意义更为深远。让它对你来说更加深远。那么，让它成为一个时刻，让你记住你在世界上有一个更伟大的目的，你被派到这个世界来重新获得这个目的——接受它、体验它、遵循它，以便为它做出贡献。</p>
<p>Let this be a time that you remember that your life is greater than simply being a person in the world who has basic needs. It is this greater part of you—this greater calling and this greater purpose—that gives meaning to all the lesser aspects of yourself and unites them harmoniously and fulfills their roles.</p>
<p>让此刻成为你铭记生命的意义的时刻，你的生命不仅仅是一个拥有基本需求的人。正是你身上的这个更伟大的部分——这个更伟大的使命和这个更伟大的目的——赋予了你所有较小的方面以意义，并将它们和谐地统一起来，并发挥它们的作用。</p>
<p>Without this greater purpose, you would be fragmented, and the aspects of your personality and mind would not find a basis for integration or unity. Without this greater purpose, you will struggle with survival and with fulfillment, but without satisfaction—sensing, feeling and knowing that as time passes, your greater purpose and your greater calling are going unfulfilled and unanswered.</p>
<p>没有这个更伟大的目的，你就会四分五裂，你的人格和心灵的各个方面就找不到整合或统一的基础。没有这个更伟大目的，你将挣扎于生存和成就，却得不到满足——感知、感受和知道，随着时间的流逝，你更伟大的目的和你的更伟大召唤将得不到实现和回应。</p>
<p>This is Christmas for you. It does not happen only once a year, but it is a reminder that beyond all of your personal needs and immediate difficulties, you have a greater mission. And like in the life of Jesus, you must come to find this. You must feel it and allow it to emerge. You must recognize that alone you cannot fulfill it, and that it is not for you alone.</p>
<p>这是属于你的圣诞节。它并非一年只有一次，但它提醒你，除了你个人的所有需求和眼前的困难之外，你还有更伟大的使命。就像耶稣生命一样，你必须来寻找它。你必须感受它，让它浮现出来。你必须认识到，你无法独自实现它，它不只属于你一个人。</p>
<p>You will wander in the desert, and you will experience the temptations of the world, and you will feel the conflict between this greater emerging part of yourself and your personal wishes and preferences and fears. For, like Jesus, you must allow this greater power and greater purpose to eclipse your life, to envelop your life and to reorganize and to redirect your life. This is Christmas.</p>
<p>你将在沙漠中徘徊，你将体验到世间的诱惑，你将感受到你自身正在显现的更伟大的部分与你个人的愿望、偏好和恐惧之间的冲突。因为，像耶稣一样，你必须允许这更伟大的力量和更伟大的目的遮蔽你的生命，笼罩你的生命，重新组织和重新引导你的生命。这就是圣诞节。</p>
<p>Christ is not an individual, but a representative of a Greater Spirituality. To think that Christ is an individual, to think that Christ is simply one who is anointed and is distinguished in contrast to all the rest is to miss the real meaning and the real purpose of the contribution of Knowledge and the expression of Divinity in the world.</p>
<p>基督不是一个个体，而是一个更伟大精神性的代表。认为基督是一个个体，认为基督只是一个受膏者，与所有其他的人相比，他与众不同，这是错失了内识贡献和神性在世界上表达的真正意义和真正目的。</p>
<p>Jesus had a unique life. You are not asked to duplicate this life. But you are called to undergo the same process of revelation and realization, of action and contribution, that he undertook in his own time, in his own way. And your demonstration will not be as visible, for in nearly all cases, the Wise must remain hidden, and their contribution must be given without fanfare and without much attraction. Jesus’s life has been inflated and deified, but it is still not understood.</p>
<p>耶稣的生命是独一无二的。你不必复制他的一生。但你被要求经历同样的启示和领悟过程，行动和贡献，这些过程都是他在他自身的时代、以他自身的方式进行的。而你的表现不会那么明显，因为在几乎所有情况下，智者都必须保持隐秘，他们的贡献必须不张扬、低调地呈现。耶稣的生命被夸大和神化，但仍未被理解。</p>
<p>People want to do good and to be good. They believe that if they can surrender to God, a God somewhere out there above and beyond them, then they will find their way, and they will feel relief from the plaguing of their own mind and from the demands of society around them.</p>
<p>人们希望行善，成为善良的人。他们相信，如果他们能够臣服于上帝，一个在他们之上某处的上帝，那么他们就会找到他们的道路，他们就会从他们自身心灵的困扰和周围社会的要求中得到解脱。</p>
<p>But really it is not falling down [on your knees] to a foreign power, but accepting the gift of the Creator within you and that same gift in others, and uniting that gift with your own mind and uniting that gift with the minds of others, that produces the demonstration of Divinity.</p>
<p>但实际上，这并不是向外来的力量臣服，而是接受你内心造物主的礼物以及他人的礼物，并将这种礼物与你自身的心灵结合起来，将这种礼物与他人的心灵结合起来，从而产生神性的展示。</p>
<p>The path to God is the path towards reunion with life and relationship with others and with yourself. It is not an escape. It is not a fantasy. It is not the ultimate form of self-indulgence. It is the reuniting with life. You cannot reunite with life all at once. You must reunite with life step by step, aspect by aspect, person by person.</p>
<p>通往上帝之路是通往与生命重聚、与他人和与你自己建立关系的道路。它不是逃避。它不是幻想。它不是自我放纵的终极形式。它是与生命的重聚。你不可能一下子与生命重聚。你必须一步一步、一点一滴、一个人一个人地与生命重聚。</p>
<p>Knowledge is the foundation for your ability to be in relationship with anyone or anything. Without Knowledge, people are in relationship only to gain advantage. They use others and they use life to gain advantage, to provide protection. They barter with their affections. They negotiate with their feelings. It is a form of commerce rather than a form of union. Prices are paid. Services are rendered. Can this be the real meaning of relationship?</p>
<p>内识是你与任何人或任何事物建立关系的能力的基础。没有内识，人们建立关系只是为了获得利益。他们利用他人，利用生命来获得利益，提供保护。他们用感情来交换。他们用感觉来谈判。这是一种商业形式，而不是一种联盟形式。价格是支付的。服务是提供的。这能是关系的真正意义吗？</p>
<p>The Mass of Christ is a celebration of Divine relationship. Christ is the person united with the Divine. Christ is the individual united with the Unseen Ones, who are the Angelic Forces of the Divine. This is the meaning of the Mass of Christ—Christmas. It is not the glorification of an individual. It is the recognition of real relationship—the relationship of the person with Knowledge within themselves, their relationship with their intrinsic bond to the Unseen Ones, their duty to humanity and their affinity with life. This is the celebration of relationship. This is the meaning of Christhood. This is the Mass of Christ.</p>
<p>基督弥撒是对神圣关系的庆祝。基督是与神圣结合的人。基督是与不可见者结合的个体，不可见者是神圣的天使力量。这就是基督弥撒——圣诞节的意义。它不是对个人的赞美。它是对真实关系的认可——人与内在内识的关系，他们与不可见者的内在纽带的关系，他们对人类的责任以及他们与生命的亲和力。这是关系的庆祝。这是基督身份的意义。这是基督弥撒。</p>
<p>Your path, then, is the path back into relationship—not romance, but relationship. You have a real relationship with the Unseen Ones. You have a fundamental relationship with Knowledge and a responsibility to Knowledge. You have a real relationship with your Spiritual Family, who have sent you into the world to become a contributor. You have a real relationship with the natural world, which is the arena of life into which you have come to participate and to contribute. You have a real relationship with your mind, which is the vehicle for your contribution and communication. You have a real relationship with your physical body, which is the vehicle for your mind and for you to be able to participate in the world and to reach people while you are here.</p>
<p>因此，你的道路是回归关系的道路——不是浪漫，而是关系。你与不可见者有着真正的关系。你和内识有着根本的关系，并对内识负有责任。你和你的精神家庭有着真正的关系，他们派你来到这个世界成为一个贡献者。你和自然界有着真正的关系，这是你来此参与和贡献的生命舞台。你和你的心灵有着真正的关系，这是你贡献和沟通的载体。你和你的物质身体有着真正的关系，这是你心灵的载体，也是你在这里时能够参与世界并接触人们的载体。</p>
<p>With Knowledge, these relationships become revealed and re-established in your awareness. With Knowledge, they find their harmony within yourself, and with yourself and the world.</p>
<p>有了内识，这些关系就会在你的觉知中被揭示和重建。有了内识，它们就会在你内心、与你自己和世界之间找到和谐。</p>
<p>Knowledge, then, is the fundamental foundation. It is the essence of your life and Being. It is the gift of the Creator to you. It contains your contribution to the world and your recognition of those key individuals that you will need in order to find your contribution and to render it.</p>
<p>那么，内识就是根本的基础。它是你的生命和存在的本质。它是造物主给你的礼物。它包含你对世界的贡献，以及你对那些关键人物的认知，你需要这些人物来找到你的贡献并做出贡献。</p>
<p>Like Jesus, you must find this greater power and allow it to emerge. It is greater than you. It was greater than Jesus. It will overtake you as it overtook him. It will open your mind to the Unseen Ones as it opened his mind to the Unseen Ones. It will lead you to contribute to the world, not only to serve and to resolve its immediate needs, but to prepare it for the future as well, as it did for Jesus in his own time.</p>
<p>像耶稣一样，你必须找到这股更伟大的力量并让它浮现。它比你更伟大。它曾经比耶稣更伟大。它将超越你，就像它超越他一样。它将打开你的心灵去面对不可见者，就像它打开他的心灵去面对不可见者一样。它将引导你为世界做出贡献，不仅服务和解决它的迫切需要，而且也为未来做好准备，就像它在耶稣的时代所做的那样。</p>
<p>If you are not content with the pleasures of the world and the distractions of the world; if you find no peace in endless romance with people and with possessions; if you look upon the world and you feel its needs and you hear its calling, then you are beginning to respond to Knowledge within yourself and within the world. You are beginning to feel beyond the intoxications of life. You are opening your mind to experience life in its grandeur and in its desperate need. You are opening yourself to Christmas, which is not a singular event but rather a celebration of life and a greater process of life, [moving you] towards Knowledge and contribution.</p>
<p>如果你不满足于世间的享乐和纷扰；如果你在与他人和财产的无尽浪漫中找不到安宁；如果你审视世界，感受到它的需求，听到它的召唤，那么你就开始回应你内在和世界内的内识。你开始感受到超越生命的陶醉。你敞开心扉去体验生命的宏伟和迫切需要。你敞开心扉去迎接圣诞节，这不是一个单一的事件，而是对生命的庆祝和更伟大的生命过程，[推动你]走向内识和贡献。</p>
<p>This Christmas, remember you have a greater responsibility, a responsibility that transcends your duties and obligations to others and even transcends your acquisition of the basic necessities of life, and your acquisition of the many things in life which are not necessities.</p>
<p>这个圣诞节，请记住你肩负着更伟大的责任，这种责任超越了你对他人的职责和义务，甚至超越了你对生命基本必需品的获取以及对生命中许多非必需品的获取。</p>
<p>For you were sent here for a purpose—to play a small but vital part in a greater education and upliftment of humanity. You were sent here to give to the world and to be in the world. The world needs you, and as you are able to regain your relationship with the world, you will experience what it is calling for and how you can respond.</p>
<p>因为你被派到这里是为了一个目的——在人类的更伟大教育和提升中扮演一个微小但至关重要的角色。你被派到这里是为了给予世界和身处世界。世界需要你，当你能够重新获得与世界的关系时，你将体验到它在召唤什么以及你能如何回应。</p>
<p>Then you will find your response and you will find your gift. And with your gift, you will find all those who are a part of your gift—those who will enable you to give and those who will receive your gift as well. And every time you give, it will be Christmas. And every time you are moved to support another, or to take action beyond your personal interests or even understanding, it will be Christmas.</p>
<p>然后你就会找到你的回应，找到你的礼物。通过你的礼物，你会找到所有属于你礼物的人——那些让你能够给予的人和那些也会接受你的礼物的人。每当你给予时，它将是圣诞节。每当你被推动去支持他人，或者采取超出你个人兴趣甚至理解范围的行动时，它将是圣诞节。</p>
<p>Christmas is a celebration of every moment that the person is moved by Knowledge and contributes with Knowledge. Though it is celebrated as one event in your calendar, as a unique time of the year, it is meant to be an experience for you to have in life and for you to share with others.</p>
<p>圣诞节是庆祝人们被内识推动并以内识作出贡献的每一个时刻。虽然圣诞节是作为日历上的一个事件来庆祝的，但作为一年中一个独特的时刻，它意味着你在生命中拥有并与他人分享的一次经历。</p>
<p>Then you will come to know Jesus, not because you can sympathize with him, but because you are undergoing a process that he underwent, and you are beginning to experience the reality that he represented. Then he will no longer be a historical figure. Then he will no longer be an idol for you, someone to worship. Then he will no longer be beyond your reach. Instead, he will become your friend, your companion, your elder brother. And his demonstration and his life, his suffering and his achievement will all have great meaning for you because you will be beginning to experience them for yourself. And you will know that he is not to be idolized, but to be embraced.</p>
<p>那时你就会知道耶稣，不是因为你能同情他，而是因为你正在经历他所经历的过程，你开始体验他所代表的现实。那时他将不再是一个历史人物。那时他将不再是你的偶像，一个需要崇拜的人。那时他将不再是你无法触及的存在。相反，他将成为你的朋友、你的同伴、你的兄长。他的示范、他的生命、他的苦难和他的成就对你来说都意义重大，因为你将开始亲身体验它们。你会知道他不是用来崇拜的偶像，而是用来拥抱的。</p>
<p>You will see that the religions that have been established in his name must receive the Grace that illuminated his life and that transformed his activity. You will be close to him, and he will be close to you, for he is with all those who are experiencing the emergence of Knowledge within themselves. He is with all those who are undergoing the reclamation of their real spirituality. He is with all those who are responding to a greater calling and purpose in life.</p>
<p>你将会看到，以他的名义创立的宗教必须获得照亮他的生命、改变他的活动的恩典。你将接近他，他也将接近你，因为他与所有正在体验内在内识涌现的人同在。他与所有正在经历真正精神性恢复的人同在。他与所有正在回应生命中更伟大召唤和目的的人同在。</p>
<p>Think not that you will undertake this alone. Though you may have to change your activities with people at the outset so that you may be free to follow a different course and a different way, your different course and your different way will bring you into a new kind of relationship with others, will consecrate your relationships and give them a greater meaning and value, beyond the discordances of your divergent personal needs and interests.</p>
<p>不要认为你将独自承担这一切。尽管你一开始可能必须改变你与他人的活动，这样你才能自由地遵循不同的路线和不同的方式，但是你的不同路线和不同方式将带你进入一种与他人的新关系，将神圣化你的关系并赋予它们一种更伟大的意义和价值，超越你不同的个人需求和兴趣的不一致。</p>
<p>Grace will be with you because Grace will be in you. And Grace will be with your relationships because Grace will be the foundation for their establishment and for their activity. And every moment you experience this, no matter how infrequent those moments may be, each one will be an experience of Christmas.</p>
<p>恩典将与你同在，因为恩典将存在于你心中。恩典将与你的关系同在，因为恩典将成为关系建立和运作的基础。你经历这一切的每一刻，无论这些时刻多么罕见，每一个都将是圣诞节的体验。</p>
<p>Therefore, at this time of the year, when We remember the life of Jesus Cade Renar, as he is known in the Greater Community and as he is called amongst the Unseen Ones, allow his life and this time of the year to remind you that you, too, have a journey towards Knowledge. You, too, have a greater purpose and a greater responsibility to find and to accept and to receive.</p>
<p>因此，每年这个时候，当我们纪念耶稣・凯德・雷纳尔（Jesus Cade Renar）的生平时，他被大社区所熟知，也被不可见者们所称呼，让他的生平和每年这个时候提醒你，你也有一段通往内识的旅程。你也有更伟大的目的和更伟大的责任去寻找、接受和领受。</p>
<p>Let this time of the year remind you that the Unseen Ones are with you and they are calling upon you to respond. And as you respond, they will become closer and closer to you, for you will need them more and more. And you will be able to understand them now with a new mind and a new experience.</p>
<p>让这一年中的这个时刻提醒你，不可见者们与你同在，他们正在召唤你做出回应。当你做出回应时，他们会离你越来越近，因为你会越来越需要他们。现在你将能够用一种新的心灵和新的体验来理解他们。</p>
<p>Let this time of year, then, be a reminder as well as a celebration. Let it point you to the future and not only to the past. For you have come to give to the world, to help meet its current needs and to prepare it for its future so that humanity may be able to prepare for its encounter with the Greater Community and all of the divergent races in the Greater Community, and also so humanity may become one great community—to find its foundation, to unite itself so that it may preserve the world and be able to participate in a greater network of civilizations in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>那么，让今年的这个时刻既是一个提醒，又是一个庆祝。让它指引你面向未来，而不仅仅是过去。因为你来这里是为了给予世界，帮助满足它当前的需求，并为它的未来做好准备，这样人类才能为它与大社区以及大社区里所有不同族群的相遇做好准备，同时也让人类能够成为一个伟大的社区——找到它的基础，团结起来，这样它才能保护世界，并能够参与大社区里一个更伟大的文明网络。</p>
<p>At whatever level your contribution may be given, whatever small part you may play in this great evolutionary change and emergence, let this Christmas be a reminder that there is a calling for you and that you seek to respond because this is the only means for fulfillment and satisfaction in life. This is the only basis for real and lasting relationships.</p>
<p>无论你的贡献有多大，无论你在这个伟大的进化变革和出现中扮演了多么微小的角色，让这个圣诞节提醒你，你受到了召唤，而你正在努力回应，因为这是实现生命价值和满足感的唯一途径。这是建立真实而持久的关系的唯一基础。</p>
<p>You, too, have come to serve the world. You, too, have come to prepare it for the future. You, too, have come to keep Knowledge alive in the world and to keep humanity moving forward. You, too, can participate in the Mass of Christ, the celebration of Divine relationship in the world and the realization of a greater purpose and activity in the world.</p>
<p>你也是来为世界服务的。你也是来为未来做准备的。你也是来让内识在世界上存活，让人类继续前进。你也是可以参加基督的弥撒，庆祝世界上的神圣关系，来实现世界上更伟大的目的和活动。</p>
<p>There will be no self-glory here, for Knowledge will simplify and harmonize your life, and will counteract all of those tendencies that could lead you astray, and will undo the misunderstandings and the misapplications which can cause harm to yourself and to others.</p>
<p>这里不会有自我荣耀，因为内识将简化与和谐你的生命，并将抵消所有可能让你误入歧途的倾向，并将消除可能对你自己和他人造成伤害的误解和误用。</p>
<p>For you will know that no matter how great your own journey may be, you are but a small part of a greater association, and your relationships will be your foundation—your relationships with others and your relationship with the Unseen Ones, whom you will rely upon.</p>
<p>因为你将知道，无论你自身的旅程有多么伟大，你只不过是一个更伟大联盟的一小部分，你的关系将成为你的基础——你与他人的关系，你与你将依赖的不可见者的关系。</p>
<p>You will realize that greatness is with you and in you, but that you cannot claim it for yourself alone. Rather, it will be a force and a presence within you that will harmonize your life and will reveal the reality of your purpose and of the greater association that has brought you into the world. It will flow through you, and it will invigorate others, and it will challenge others, even beyond your words and your actions, for Knowledge is with you.</p>
<p>你将意识到伟大与你同在、在你之内，但你无法独自宣称它。相反，它将是你内在的一种力量和一种存在，它将协调你的生命，并将揭示你目的的现实以及将你带入世界的更伟大关联。它将流经你，它将激励他人，它将挑战他人，甚至超越你的话语和你的行动，因为内识与你同在。</p>
<p>This, then, will lead you to the celebration of Christmas, to the experience of Knowledge, to the experience of genuine relationship, to the experience of purpose, meaning and direction in life according to life in its eternal dimensions.</p>
<p>这将引导你庆祝圣诞节，体验内识，体验真诚的关系，体验生命永恒维度中的目的、意义和方向。</p>
<p>And you will think of Jesus. And you will be thankful that he succeeded. When you are in doubt, when you are uncertain, when the way becomes inexplicable and indecipherable, you will remember him because he kept traveling, and he met and found his destination. And you will thank him because he left a legacy for you through his demonstration and through his sacrifice and difficulty. He has kept Knowledge alive in the world, as have many others. For he was not alone, and his contribution has been kept alive in the minds and hearts of many.</p>
<p>你会想到耶稣。你会感谢他成功了。当你怀疑时，当你不确定时，当你前路难解时，你会记得他，因为他一直在前行，他遇见并找到了他的目的地。你会感谢他，因为他通过他的示范、他的牺牲和困难给你留下了一笔遗产。他和许多其他人一样，让内识在世界上永存。因为他并不孤单，他的贡献一直活在许多人的心灵与内心中。</p>
<p>Come, then, to Christmas. Receive the Mass of Christ. It is beyond any religious tradition. It is timeless. It is occurring throughout the Greater Community of worlds. It does not belong to any group or nation, any religious tradition, any church or any organization.</p>
<p>那么，来吧，庆祝圣诞节。参加基督弥撒。它超越任何宗教传统。它是永恒的。它发生在整个世界大社区。它不属于任何群体或国家、任何宗教传统、任何教会或任何组织。</p>
<p>It is the activity of God in the world to activate Knowledge in individuals and to reunite them with their Spiritual Family, who are in the world and beyond the world, and to support the emergence of Knowledge and all of the gifts that Knowledge is here to give to the world of humanity at this time.</p>
<p>它是上帝在世界上的活动，以激活个体内在的内识，并让他们和他们的精神家庭重新统一，他们在这个世界里和世界之外，并支持内识的呈现以及内识在此此刻赋予人类世界的所有礼物。</p>
<p>This is your Christmas. Jesus is with you. The Unseen Ones are watching. You can feel them, and you can hear them. Though They will not come too close so as not to dominate you or to cast too great an influence upon you, They will abide with you. Remember them. They have not forgotten you. Remember Jesus. He will resonate with you as you resonate with him.</p>
<p>这是你的圣诞节。耶稣与你同在。不可见者正在注视着你。你可以感觉到他们，你可以听到他们。尽管他们不会靠得太近，以免控制你或对你产生太大的影响，但他们将与你同在。记住他们。他们没有忘记你。记住耶稣。当你与他产生共鸣时，他也会与你产生共鸣。</p>
<p>Then the gift of Christmas will be given. Then the celebration will sound. Then you will feel timeless, but within time itself. Then you will feel great purpose within a world that seems to have no purpose. Then you will feel connected amongst the race of humanity that is disconnected. Then you will feel invigorated around those who are discouraged and downcast. Then giving will happen through you, naturally, beyond your control, but with your full participation.</p>
<p>然后圣诞礼物就会被送出。然后庆祝会响起。然后你会感到时间是永恒的，但又在时间本身之内。然后你会在一个似乎没有目的的世界中感受到伟大的目的。然后你会感到与分离的人类种族联系在一起。然后你会在那些灰心丧气的人身边感到振奋。然后给予会通过你自然而然地发生，不受你的控制，但有你的充分参与。</p>
<p>Let us conclude with this blessing:</p>
<p>让我们以这样的祝福来结束我们的演讲：</p>
<p>“The presence of Knowledge throughout the Greater Community invigorates and unites all life and gives purpose and meaning beyond the disassociation of ignorance, hatred and contempt. Let me, then, be the recipient of Knowledge. Let me, then, embody Knowledge. Let me, then, learn to be an expression of Knowledge. Let my mind be illuminated. Let my body be invigorated. Let my relationships be balanced and harmonized. And let the way open before me, for I am ready to begin.”</p>
<p>“内识遍布大社区，它振奋并团结了所有生命，并赋予了超越无知、仇恨和蔑视的分离的目的和意义。那么，让我成为内识的接收者。那么，让我体现内识。那么，让我学习成为内识的一种表达。让我的心灵得到启迪。让我的身体得到振奋。让我的关系得到平衡与和谐。让我的道路在我面前打开，因为我已经准备好开始了。”</p>
