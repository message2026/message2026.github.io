<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on April 27, 2008 in Esfahan, Iran<br>2008 年 4 月 27 日，在伊朗伊斯法罕(Esfahan, Iran)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone in the world is born into a family. Even if that family has been lost or has been broken up, even if you do not know your parents—if you are orphaned or even given away—you are born into a family.</p>
<p>世界上的每个人都出生在一个家庭中。即使这个家庭已经消失或支离破碎，即使你不知道你的父母——如果你是孤儿，甚至被遗弃——你还是出生在一个家庭之中。</p>
<p>For most people, this family relationship is fundamental to their upbringing, to their conditioning, to their thinking, to their orientation to the world and to their understanding of themselves as a part of a society. So the idea of family is fundamental. In some cultures, it is emphasized more than others, but it is still a central focus.</p>
<p>对于大多数人来说，这种家庭关系是他们的成长、他们的条件、他们的思维、他们的世界观以及他们对他们自己作为社会一员的理解的基础。因此，家庭观念至关重要。在某些文化中，家庭观念比其他文化更受重视，但它仍然是中心焦点。</p>
<p>In life, you have two families. You have your physical blood relationships, particularly your parents and your siblings, who bring you into the world and who hopefully prepare you to be in the world—to give you a place, and a role and an opportunity to survive and to advance here.</p>
<p>在生命中，你有两个家庭。你有血缘关系，特别是你的父母和兄弟姐妹，他们把你带到这个世界，并希望帮助你做好在这个世界上生存和进步的准备——给你一个地方、一个角色和一个在这里生存和进步的机会。</p>
<p>But you also have a Spiritual Family, a family that helps to raise you in your greater understanding of yourself. Here you are not born into their care, like you are your physical family, but instead they come to you. You encounter them. And they have a great impact on stirring a deeper awareness within you, a deeper understanding and the deeper Mind that God has placed within you—the Mind of Knowledge.</p>
<p>但你也有一个精神上的家庭，这个家庭帮助你成长，让你更加理解你自己。在这里，你并非生来就受到他们的照顾，就像你的物质家庭一样，而是他们来到你身边。你与他们相遇。他们对激发你内在更深层次的觉知、更深层次的理解和更深层次的心灵有着伟大的影响，而这正是上帝放置在你内在的更深层次的心灵——内识的心灵。</p>
<p>Spiritual Family is very mysterious, hard to understand. These are very special individuals who are destined to encounter you when you are ready, when you are able to receive them. And their upbringing really has to do with your greater purpose for being in the world. They represent a greater association of which you are a part already—an association that up until this time, you have not been mature enough to understand or to receive.</p>
<p>精神家庭非常神秘，难以理解。这些是非常特殊的个体，当你准备好时，当你能够接受他们时，他们注定会与你相遇。他们的成长实际上与你身处世界的更伟大目的有关。他们代表着一个更伟大的联盟，你已经是其中的一部分——一个直到此时，你还不够成熟，无法理解或接受的联盟。</p>
<p>Perhaps in your life already there has been an individual here or there, perhaps a real teacher or a minister or a priest or a very wise person—within your family or beyond your family—who has spoken of a deeper reality within you in such a way that has stirred you. It has stimulated you. It has affected you in some way that nothing else can.</p>
<p>或许在你的生命中，这里或那里已经存在过一个人，或许是一位真正的老师或牧师或神父或一位非常有智慧的人——在你的家庭内或家庭外——他以触动你的方式讲述了你内在的一个更深层次的现实。它激励了你。它以任何其他事物都无法做到的方式影响了你。</p>
<p>It is not like you heard a wonderful idea from someone in conversation or in a lecture or a book. This person has recognized you at a deeper level, and it has had an impact upon you. This is only the very beginning of being able to experience your Spiritual Family, a greater association on a larger level.</p>
<p>它不像你在谈话、讲座或书中听到某人的一个绝妙想法。这个人在更深层次的层面上认出了你，并且对你产生了影响。这只是能够体验你的精神家庭、在更伟大的层面上体验更伟大联系的开始。</p>
<p>For God knows that your immediate, worldly family cannot raise you spiritually, cannot call out of you your greater purpose in life, cannot even really recognize this within you. For even within the family unit, this is very rare. It is rare that perhaps one of your parents will see something in you that requires a greater understanding, a unique preparation.</p>
<p>因为上帝知道，你的直系世俗家庭无法在精神上培养你，无法唤起你生命中更伟大的目的，甚至无法真正认识到你内心的这一点。因为即使在家庭中，这种情况也非常罕见。也许你的父母中会有一个人看到了你身上的内识，而内识需要更伟大的理解和独特的准备。</p>
<p>Perhaps you would hope that every parent would have this ability to recognize a greater gift within their children, but alas it is not the case. It is a rare occurrence and extremely valuable whenever it can happen.</p>
<p>也许你会希望每个父母都有这种能力，能够发现孩子身上更伟大的礼物，但不幸的是，事实并非如此。这种情况很少见，而且每当发生这种情况时，它就极其宝贵。</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a grandparent or an uncle or a cousin or some other person in your extended family who has the ability to recognize something in you that even you have not recognized, that you have not discovered for yourself. So you must see there is a great distinction here between your worldly family and your Spiritual Family.</p>
<p>或许是你的祖父母、叔叔、表亲或大家庭中的其他人有能力认识到你身上某些你尚未认识到、你自己尚未发现的内识。因此你必须看到，你的世俗家庭和你的精神家庭之间存在着伟大区别。</p>
<p>Now when we present this idea of Spiritual Family, it is difficult to understand, and people tend to make a lot of mistakes regarding it. Upon hearing about this and contemplating it at first, some people will say, “Oh, I like my friend so very much. He must be part of my Spiritual Family” or “I am in love with this person. We are going to be married. They must be part of my Spiritual Family.” Or you might say, “Oh, I get along so easily with this person. They must be part of my Spiritual Family.”</p>
<p>现在，当我们提出精神家庭这个概念时，它是很难理解的，人们往往会对此犯很多错误。听到这个概念并开始思考时，有些人会说：“哦，我非常喜欢我的朋友。他一定是我精神家庭的一部分”或“我爱上了这个人。我们要结婚了。他们一定是我精神家庭的一部分。”或者你可能会说：“哦，我和这个人相处得很好。他们一定是我精神家庭的一部分。”</p>
<p>But this is incorrect. This represents a confusion. It is understandable and predictable, especially at the outset. For you have not gained the maturity yet, or the ability, or the self-awareness, to discern someone from your Spiritual Family who is being sent to assist you in making progress.</p>
<p>但这是错误的。这代表着一种困惑。这是可以理解和预料的，尤其是在一开始。因为你还没有获得成熟度、能力或自我觉知，来辨别出你的精神家庭中被派来协助你取得进步的存在。</p>
<p>This progress is not simply worldly accomplishment—being able to establish your position in society, a meaningful work and so forth. It has to do with the memory that you are here for a greater purpose in service to the Creator of all life and to your Spiritual Family, most of whom exist beyond the world—your learning group that you have advanced with, not only in this life but in times before.</p>
<p>这一进步并非简单的世俗成就——能够确立你在社会中的地位、从事有意义的工作等等。它与这样的记忆有关：你来此是为了一个更伟大目的，服务于所有生命的创造者、服务于你的精神家庭，他们大多数存在于世界之外——你与之一起进步的学习小组，不仅在今生，而且在以往。</p>
<p>This is a new idea being presented to the human family. And it will seem very confounding. People will make lots of assumptions and associations regarding it, but they do not really understand it yet.</p>
<p>这是呈现给人类大家庭的一个新想法。它看起来会非常令人困惑。人们会对此做出许多假设和联想，但他们还没有真正理解它。</p>
<p>If you could see your life within the Greater Community of worlds, within the universe itself, and recognize that you have had a history in this Greater Community, that you are not only a human being, that this life is not the only life—if you could see yourself within this far greater context, then you would begin perhaps to understand that you have relationships beyond this world, beyond this life. And if you could consider that without weaving a lot of fantasy, then the idea of Spiritual Family will perhaps, hopefully, be something you can consider in a genuine way.</p>
<p>如果你能把你自己的生命置于世界大社区中、宇宙本身中，并认识到你在这个大社区中有着一段历史，你不仅仅是一个人，这个生命并不是唯一的生命——如果你能把你自己置于这个更伟大的背景中，那么你或许就会开始理解，你拥有超越这个世界、超越这个生命的关系。如果你能不编织太多幻想地去思考这一点，那么精神家庭的概念或许、但愿能够成为你能够真诚思考的事情。</p>
<p>This is one of the mysteries of life and of your life and of every person’s life here. There are many things that humanity as a whole has not discovered about the nature and evolution of life. It has only been recently that the nature and evolution of life has been understood at a biological and physical level.</p>
<p>这是生命、你的生命以及这里每个人生命的神秘之一。关于生命的自然与进化，人类还有很多未解之谜。直到最近，人们才在生物学和物理学层面上理解了生命的自然和进化。</p>
<p>But you are not simply a physical being. You are not simply an animal living on the earth. You have a conscience. You have an awareness of the future and the past. You have an imagination. You have a creative ability. You are not simply fulfilling a function in nature. Therefore, you are connected to life and to nature at a greater level, even if you are unaware of this, which for most people is the case.</p>
<p>但你不仅仅是一个物质存在。你不仅仅是生活在地球上的动物。你有一种良知。你对未来和过去有一种觉知。你有想象力。你有创造能力。你不仅仅是在自然界中履行职责。因此，你在一种更伟大的层面上与生命和自然相连，即使你没有察觉到这一点，而对大多数人来说都是如此。</p>
<p>So humanity as a whole, and society at large, has a very limited understanding of nature and evolution, for the human race has just not advanced that far. It is still primitive and tribal. It is still very focused on survival and competition with one another. It has not advanced beyond this rather primitive state that the other worlds and nations in the universe that have made this advancement [have,] even though they are not very common.</p>
<p>因此，人类作为一个整体，以及整个社会，对自然和进化的理解非常有限，因为人类种族还没有发展到那么远。它仍然是原始的和部落的。它仍然非常注重生存和相互竞争。它还没有超越这种相当原始的状态，而宇宙中其他取得这种进步的世界和国家，尽管它们并不常见，但却已经取得了这种进步。</p>
<p>Given the abundance of life in the universe, they are not very common. But wisdom is not very common. The power and the presence of Knowledge that God has placed within each person, the manifestation of this is not very common.</p>
<p>鉴于宇宙中生命的丰富，它们并不常见。但智慧并不常见。上帝赋予每个人内识的力量和存在，​​其表现并不常见。</p>
<p>It is as if the entire human family is sort of in early middle school in the evolution of life. You are all sort of in the fifth grade. You are struggling to learn, and you are making lots of mistakes, and tragedy is occurring everywhere, and deprivation is occurring everywhere.</p>
<p>整个人类大家庭在生命进化的进程中，似乎都处于初中阶段。你们都处于五年级阶段。你们在努力学习，犯下许多错误，到处都在发生悲剧，到处都在遭受剥夺。</p>
<p>But as a whole, you have not advanced very far, given what God has really created in you and the potential for humanity in the future, particularly as you gain an awareness of your place in the universe and are able to develop the skill and discernment necessary to engage with other nations and races of beings in the universe, which you are destined to do and which represents one of the great thresholds that humanity is facing, even at this time.</p>
<p>但作为一个整体，你们并未进步太多，考虑到上帝在你们内在真正创造的内识以及人类未来的潜能，特别是当你们获得了对你们在宇宙中位置的觉知，并能够发展必要的技能和辨识力来和宇宙中其他民族和种族的存在进行接触时，这是你们注定要做的，这也代表着人类即使在此时此刻正在面对的伟大门槛之一。</p>
<p>Given your daily life and circumstances, this all seems fantastic and unbelievable, and perhaps you like it or you do not like it, but it seems irrelevant to your life.</p>
<p>考虑到你的日常生活和环境，这一切似乎都很奇妙和令人难以置信，也许你喜欢它，也许你不喜欢它，但它似乎与你的生命无关。</p>
<p>But in essence your Spiritual Family, your life in the Greater Community, has everything to do with why you are here in the world at this time. And it has everything to do with the future of humanity and whether humanity as whole and human civilization as a whole will be able to survive and advance in the future.</p>
<p>但本质上，你的精神家庭、你在大社区中的生命，与你此刻为何来到这个世界息息相关。它与人类的未来息息相关，与整个人类和整个人类文明是否能够在未来生存和进步息息相关。</p>
<p>For the world is emerging into the Greater Community. It is part of the evolution of humanity. And this evolution will be taking great steps in your lifetime here.</p>
<p>因为世界正在步入大社区。这是人类进化的一部分。而这个进化将在你这个生命的时间中迈出伟大的步伐。</p>
<p>For you now it is important to understand that you live life at two levels—the life at which you think and the life at which you know, the life of the mind and the life of Knowledge, or Spirit, within you. Therefore, you have family at two levels. You have the family at the level of your mind and your body, your worldly family. And you have family at a greater level, your Spiritual Family, a family connected to Knowledge and greater purpose in life.</p>
<p>对你来说，现在重要的是要理解你的生命处于两个层面——你思考的生命和你知道的生命，心灵的生命和你内在内识或精神的生命。因此，你的家庭处于两个层面。你的家庭处于你的心灵和身体层面，即你的世俗家庭。而你的家庭处于一个更伟大的层面，即你的精神家庭，一个与内识和生命中更伟大目的相联接的家庭。</p>
<p>You who are hearing these words, you who are receiving the Voice of the New Message from God, you must learn now of this. For you are learning a greater dimension of nature and reality. It has to do with your greater purpose in the world, your deeper nature and those who will support and assist the realization of this deeper nature and this greater purpose.</p>
<p>你们这些正在聆听这些话语的人，你们这些正在接收来自上帝的新讯息之声的人，你们现在必须学习这一点。因为你们正在学习自然和现实的一个更伟大的维度。它与你在世界上的更伟大目的、你更深层次的自然以及那些将支持和协助实现这个更深层次自然和这个更伟大目的的人有关。</p>
<p>For now, this should not be a topic of conversation with other people. Do not go around talking about your Spiritual Family. Do not use this as a subject of conversation or speculation. But instead keep it sacred within your heart, realizing you do not really understand it yet, but that it holds importance for your deeper life and for your greater understanding.</p>
<p>现在，这不应该成为与他人交谈的话题。不要到处谈论你的精神家庭。不要把这当作谈话或猜测的主题。而是把它神圣地放在你的心中，意识到你还没有真正理解它，但它对你更深层次的生命和你更伟大的理解是重要的。</p>
<p>All things sacred should be held in this manner. They should not be debated and argued. They should not be brought up in conversation, except very rarely, and then only with certain individuals.</p>
<p>一切神圣的事物都应如此对待。它们不应被争论和争辩。它们不应在谈话中被提起，除非是极少数情况下，并且只应与某些人谈论。</p>
<p>There will be those you are waiting to meet who help to activate your awareness of yourself at a deeper level. It is not just their ideas that will stimulate you. It is their presence. It is something about them. It is something about your engagement that stimulates an ancient memory within you and a reoccurring feeling that you are here to do something greater.</p>
<p>你正等待着遇见一些人，他们会帮助你在更深层次上激活对你自己的觉知。激励你的不仅仅是他们的想法。而是他们的存在。是他们身上的某种特质。是你的参与激发了你内心深处的古老记忆，让你不断产生一种感觉，那就是你来这里是为了做更伟大的事情。</p>
<p>Do not worry that everyone around you does not seem to be interested in this or responding to this, for this must happen at the level of the individual. This self-realization, this deeper awareness, this deeper nature, is discovered on an individual basis. You cannot go out and tell everyone about it and hope for any kind of acceptance and recognition.</p>
<p>不要担心你周围的人似乎对此不感兴趣或对此不响应，因为这必须在个人层面发生。这种自我认知、这种更深层次的觉知、这种更深层次的自然，都是在个人的基础上发现的。你不能出去告诉每个人，并希望得到任何形式的接受和认可。</p>
<p>This is what it means to be called from God. A calling is not simply you heard a voice and you decided to do something. A calling is when you are called out of your normal awareness and circumstances to receive something greater and more remarkable. Yet this calling is very humble. You are not asked to become a saint or a leader or an avatar or someone who is powerful, all knowing.</p>
<p>这就是被上帝召唤的意义。召唤不只是你听到一个声音，然后决定做某件事。召唤是当你被召唤离开你的正常觉知和环境去接受更伟大、更非凡的事情。然而，这种召唤非常谦逊。你不会被要求成为圣人、领袖、化身或某个无所不知、无所不能的人。</p>
<p>A calling is very simple, very humble, but it speaks of a greater reality within you because you are here to do something greater—not greater in the sense of being magnificent, but greater in the sense of it being beyond your normal range of activities, greater in that it speaks to a greater awareness and motivation within you.</p>
<p>召唤非常简单、非常谦逊，但是它诉说着你内在的一个更伟大的现实，因为你来到这里是为了做一些更伟大的事情——不是宏伟意义上的更伟大，而是超出你正常活动范围意义上的更伟大，是它诉说着你内在的一个更伟大的觉知和动机。</p>
<p>Here there is a tension between your worldly family and obligations you have here and your Spiritual Family, which speaks of your responsibility to God. Let us speak about this now.</p>
<p>这里，你的世俗家庭和义务与你的精神家庭之间存在着一种紧张关系，这体现了你对上帝的责任。现在让我们来谈谈这个问题。</p>
<p>Many people in the world, if they have a functioning family—even if they have a very healthy and supportive family—will have family responsibilities and obligations. Under normal circumstances, this is fine. It is understandable. It is even necessary in order to support the social fabric. It is necessary to sustain human civilization even, as well as your local culture and society.</p>
<p>世界上的许多人，如果他们有一个正常运转的家庭——即使他们有一个非常健康和相互支持的家庭——也会有家庭责任和义务。在正常情况下，这是可以理解的。这甚至是维持社会结构的必要条件。这甚至是维持人类文明以及当地文化和社会的必要条件。</p>
<p>But when a person receives a calling, when they meet someone from their Spiritual Family, when they are stirred or something awakens within them that is something fundamental to their nature and their purpose in the world, now they are beginning to respond to a greater responsibility and obligation—something that is greater than their obligations or responsibilities to their family and to their local culture. This can create a great conflict, and in most cases it does.</p>
<p>但是当一个人收到一种召唤，当他们遇见来自他们精神家庭的某个人，当他们受到触动或者他们内在的内识被唤醒，那是他们的自然和他们在世界上的目的的根本性的东西，现在他们开始回应一个更伟大的责任和义务——某种比他们对家庭和他们当地文化的义务或责任更伟大的内识。这可能造成一个巨大的冲突，而且在大多数情况下确实如此。</p>
<p>Even the great Messengers who have been sent into the world, even they experienced this conflict, this friction, between their worldly identity and their greater identity. They were not born with an awareness of their greater purpose. It came to the fore and was stimulated by God later in life.</p>
<p>即使是那些被派到这个世界的伟大信使，他们也经历过这种冲突，这种摩擦，在他们的世俗身份和更伟大身份之间。他们生来并没有觉知到他们的更伟大目的。这种觉知在后来的生命中才浮现出来，并受到上帝的刺激。</p>
<p>They were not born perfect and immaculate. Even the great gifts they were carrying for humanity would not arise or be stimulated until later in their lives. And here there was a conflict between them and their families, and their family obligations, for they had to break away to fulfill their greater responsibility to God and their greater calling. They could not be bound and held back by their family responsibilities.</p>
<p>他们并非生来完美无瑕。他们身上蕴藏的伟大礼物甚至要到晚年才会出现或被激发出来。而这里，他们与家人以及家庭义务之间产生了冲突，因为他们必须脱离家庭才能履行对上帝的更伟大责任和更伟大召唤。他们不能被家庭责任所束缚和拖累。</p>
<p>What this means is if there is an individual within your family, or if the individual is you yourself, and this greater calling begins to emerge and it is authentic, you will struggle with it within yourself, and there will be problems within your family. For they will not understand what is motivating you now, and you will not understand it. For at the outset, it is incomprehensible.</p>
<p>这意味着如果你的家庭里有一个人，或者这个人就是你自己，而这个更伟大召唤开始呈现，并且它是真实的，那么你将在你自己的内心与之斗争，你的家庭中将会出现问题。因为他们将不理解现在是什么在激励着你，你也将不理解它。因为一开始，它是不可理解的。</p>
<p>Your challenge is to follow it even if you do not understand it. Your challenge is to honor it even if you have no way of affirming its reality, have no way of validating its significance.</p>
<p>你的挑战是即使你不理解它，也要遵循它。你的挑战是即使你无法肯定它的真实性、无法证实它的重要性，也要尊重它。</p>
<p>This is a dangerous threshold for people, for they can make many mistakes here. They can hold themselves back. They can yield to their family pressures—to only be a son, or a father, or a member of the family, or a member of society.</p>
<p>这对于人们来说是一个危险的门槛，因为他们可能在这里犯下许多错误。他们可能自我克制。他们可能屈服于家庭的压力——只做儿子、父亲、家庭成员或社会成员。</p>
<p>Even though God is calling them to be something else, to begin their preparation to be something else, they will not have the courage and the faith to do this. And the pressures from their family and their culture can be too great and overbearing for them.</p>
<p>尽管上帝召唤他们成为不同的人，开始为成为不同的人做准备，但他们没有勇气和信心这样做。来自家庭和文化的压力对他们来说可能太大、太过强大。</p>
<p>It is a great threshold. It is one of the first great thresholds that anyone who is so blessed—and anyone who is so fortunate to receive a greater calling—must contend with and must face.</p>
<p>它是一个伟大的门槛。它是任何被祝福的人——以及任何有幸收到更伟大召唤的人——必须面对和应对的第一个伟大门槛之一。</p>
<p>If you recognize this in one of your children, if you recognize this in one of your siblings or in any family member, it is important for you to understand that they are undergoing something of a greater nature. They may not be successful in responding to this, as there are very real risks associated with it, but it is important here that you give them your support and you listen to them, to hear if there is something greater happening within their life.</p>
<p>如果你在你的一个孩子身上、在你的一个兄弟姐妹或任何家庭成员身上发现了这一点，那么你必须明白，他们正在经历着某种更伟大的事情。他们可能无法成功应对，因为这会带来非常现实的风险，但重要的是，你要给予他们支持，倾听他们，去听他们的生命是否正发生更伟大的事情。</p>
<p>For many people are having psychological problems. They are breaking down emotionally. They are not relating to themselves or to their family or their circumstances, but this does not mean that they are experiencing a greater calling. Be very careful here not to make a mistake in your understanding.</p>
<p>因为许多人都有心理问题。他们的情绪正在崩溃。他们无法与他们自己、家人或环境产生共鸣，但这并不意味着他们正在经历更伟大的召唤。在这里要非常小心，不要在理解上犯错误。</p>
<p>For this calling is rare. Many people are not very healthy or happy psychologically or emotionally. Many people are experiencing great deprivation. Many people are having difficulty even functioning within their current circumstances. But this does not mean that they are having a greater calling from God.</p>
<p>因为这种召唤是罕见的。许多人在心理或情感上都不太健康或不快乐。许多人正在经历巨大的匮乏。许多人甚至难以在当前环境中正常生活。但这并不意味着他们正在接受来自上帝的更伟大召唤。</p>
<p>But if you should know of this in someone, a family member or a friend, you need to give them the opportunity and support them in following a deeper calling, a greater light in their life—doing this, understanding there are great risks associated with this.</p>
<p>但如果你知道某个人、家庭中的一员或朋友有这种症状，你需要给他们机会并支持他们去追随他们生命中的这种更深层次的召唤、一种他们生命中更伟大的光——这样做的同时，要理解这其中存在着巨大的风险。</p>
<p>It is like beginning a whole new life of which you know so very little, but you must begin. If this is your experience now, then perhaps there is someone in your family who can recognize there is something unique and different happening within you. Perhaps there is someone in your life who, even though they cannot take this journey themselves, even though they themselves are not experiencing such a calling, can say to you: “You must follow this. You must trust this.”</p>
<p>它就像开始一种全新的生命，你对这种生命知之甚少，但你必须开始。如果这是你现在的经历，那么也许你的家人中有人能认识到你身上正在发生一些独特而不同的事情。也许你生命中的某个人，即使他们自己无法踏上这段旅程，即使他们自己没有经历这样的召唤，也能对你说：“你必须遵循这一点。你必须信任这一点。”</p>
<p>There is a great advantage to have someone who can affirm this within you. For there are many who are called who cannot respond. They are bound by their families. They are bound by their obligations. They are tied to an old understanding of themselves. They cannot break free. It is like they are tethered to the ground and cannot emerge, cannot rise up.</p>
<p>拥有一个能够肯定你内心这一点的人，是一个巨大的优势。因为有许多人被召唤却无法回应。他们被家庭束缚。他们被义务束缚。他们被对他们自己的旧理解所束缚。他们无法挣脱。他们就像被拴在地上，无法脱身，无法站起来。</p>
<p>It is a great tragedy, but God knows that not everyone can respond. Just like every seed that drops in the ground will not mature into a plant. Every acorn that falls to the ground will not be a great oak tree. That is why there are many of them.</p>
<p>它是一场巨大的悲剧，但上帝知道，并不是每个人都能做出回应。就像掉在地里的种子不会长成植物一样。掉在地上的橡子也不会长成参天大树。这就是为什么橡子如此之多。</p>
<p>Not everyone here will realize their greater purpose and calling. Even if it has been activated by God, even if the time has come for the emergence of their greater awareness, even if they have encountered a member of their Spiritual Family, it does not assure success here at all.</p>
<p>并非这里的每个人都能意识到他们的更伟大目的和召唤。即使它已被上帝激活，即使他们更伟大觉知出现的时刻已经到来，即使他们遇到了他们精神家庭的一名成员，但这根本不能保证在这里取得成功。</p>
<p>Many will go into denial. Many will take a few steps and go no further. And it is a tragedy because now they know there is something greater about their life, and if they do not follow this, it will haunt them. It will haunt them for the rest of their life. It will be a problem that nothing, no amount of pleasure or distraction, can really resolve.</p>
<p>许多人会陷入否认。许多人会迈出几步，但不会再进一步​​。它是一场悲剧，因为现在他们知道他们的生命中有更伟大的事情，如果他们不遵循它，它就会困扰他们。它会困扰他们一生。它将是一个问题，无论多少快乐或消遣，都无法真正解决。</p>
<p>For once you are called, you must respond. If you cannot respond or do not respond, for whatever reason, it will be a haunting difficulty in your life. Perhaps you will be envious and condemning of anyone else who does respond. And this can be the case.</p>
<p>因为一旦你被召唤，你就必须回应。如果你不能回应或不回应，无论出于什么原因，它都会成为你生命中挥之不去的难题。也许你会嫉妒和谴责其他回应的人。情况可能就是这样。</p>
<p>The New Message from God reveals what this calling means. For at this great time of change and difficulty for humanity, it will require more than just a rare individual here and there to rise to their greater purpose and calling. It will require the emergence of many more people.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息揭示了这个召唤的意义。因为在人类面临伟大变革和困难的时期，需要的不仅仅是偶尔出现的个别个体来实现他们更伟大的目的和召唤。它需要更多人的出现。</p>
<p>And so the process of initiation, the process of engagement with your Spiritual Family, now becomes something that must be shared with the world, and not simply held in secret in monasteries or in secret teachings and so forth.</p>
<p>因此入门的过程、与你的精神家庭接触的过程，现在变成了必须与世界分享的事情，而不仅仅是在修道院或秘密教导等中秘密进行。</p>
<p>Even though the vast majority of people will not be able to understand it, will not see its importance or its significance, it must be shared and broadcast because the time has come for humanity to arise in its own defense, to unite to save the world and to unite to face the reality of life in the universe—life from the Greater Community, who are now engaging with your world.</p>
<p>尽管绝大多数人无法理解它，看不到它的重要性或它的意义，但它必须被分享和传播，因为人类已经到了奋起自卫、团结起来拯救世界、团结起来面对宇宙生命现实的时候了——来自大社区的生命，他们现在正在参与你们的世界。</p>
<p>You have reached a threshold—the evolution of civilization, the evolution of humanity—where there must be a greater awareness emerging within enough people. And that is why the New Message from God is being sent into the world. God’s former Messages cannot prepare you for this.</p>
<p>你们已经到达了一个门槛——文明的进化，人类的进化——其中必须有足够多的人内心产生更伟大的觉知。这就是为什么来自上帝的新讯息被发送到这个世界。上帝以前的讯息无法让你们为此做好准备。</p>
<p>Therefore, a New Revelation must be given for humanity. Part of this Revelation deals with the process of calling and initiation and the reality of your Spiritual Family.</p>
<p>因此，必须为人类赐予新的启示。这个启示的一部分涉及召唤和入门的过程以及你精神家庭的现实。</p>
<p>It is very challenging to learn something new, to receive something new, to be a part of something new. Everyone clings to the past for security, for acceptance, for social advantage. But to receive a New Revelation and to live in a time of Revelation, oh, that is very challenging.</p>
<p>学习新事物、接受新事物、成为新事物的一部分都是非常具有挑战性的。每个人都执着于过去，以获得安全感、获得认可、获得社会优势。但接受新启示并生活在启示时代，哦，这非常具有挑战性。</p>
<p>The only reason that you can do it is because God has placed Knowledge within you. If there were no Knowledge within you, you would always function as a part of a group. You would be like a herd of cattle, always following the herd, the group, for safety, for security, for acceptance, for validation, for recognition.</p>
<p>你之所以能做到，唯一的原因是上帝将内识置于你的内心。如果你内心没有内识，你永远只是群体的一部分。你会像一群牛，永远跟随牛群、群体，寻求安全、寻求保障、寻求接受、寻求确认、寻求认可。</p>
<p>But you are not a herd of cattle. Humanity has a greater promise, and every person here has Knowledge deep within them—Knowledge they have not discovered, Knowledge which can bless and protect them and guide them to a greater accomplishment and to a greater service to humanity.</p>
<p>但你们不是一群牛。人类拥有一个更伟大的承诺，这里的每个人都拥有内在深处的内识——他们尚未发现的内识，这种内识能够祝福和保护他们，引导他们实现更伟大成就，为人类提供更伟大服务。</p>
<p>It is difficult to be at the beginning of a New Revelation. It is like starting all over again. Everything you have learned about religion and spirituality, you must set it aside. Many people are not willing to do that. They have used their education to elevate themselves, but here you must start from the beginning, with an open mind, not assuming anything.</p>
<p>处在新启示的开端是很困难的。它就像从头开始。你必须把你所学到的关于宗教和精神性的一切抛在一边。许多人不愿意这样做。他们利用所受的教育来提升他们自己，但在这里你必须从头开始，保持开放的心灵，不去假设任何事情。</p>
<p>How many people can do that? How many people have the courage and the humility to start at the beginning—setting aside all of their beliefs, all of their important ideas about themselves and the world? Who has the courage and the humility to do that? Who has the courage and the humility to learn of their deeper nature and the reality of their Spiritual Family and humanity’s emergence into a Greater Community of intelligent life?</p>
<p>有多少人能够做到这一点？有多少人有勇气和谦逊从头开始——抛开他们所有的信仰、他们关于他们自己和世界的所有重要想法？谁有勇气和谦逊做到这一点？谁有勇气和谦逊去学习他们更深层次的自然、他们的精神家庭的现实以及人类向一个智能生命大社区的迈进？</p>
<p>Do not look for the experts here, the leaders of religion and government, for their understanding of themselves has been built upon the past and very rarely will any of them be able to comprehend the greater threshold facing humanity now. Very few of them will be able to respond to a New Message from God.</p>
<p>不要在这里寻找专家、宗教和政府的领袖，因为他们对他们自己的理解建立在过去之上，他们中很少有人能够理解人类现在面临的更大门槛。他们中很少有人能够回应来自上帝的新讯息。</p>
<p>God’s New Message is such a different reality. It is such a shift to a higher plane of existence that even at the outset, people will not recognize it. They will think it is just a variation of what already exists. They will look at its ideas and think, “Oh, well, I understand these ideas.”</p>
<p>上帝的新讯息是如此不同。它是如此地向更高层次的存在转变，以至于人们一开始都不会认识到它。他们会认为它只是已经存在的事物的变体。他们会看着它的想法，想：“哦，好吧，我理解这些想法。”</p>
<p>But they do not understand these ideas. They do not know what they are looking at. Just like Jesus was treated as a criminal, they will look at the New Message as some kind of deception. They will not see what is golden from what is stone.</p>
<p>但他们不理解这些想法。他们不知道他们在看什么。就像耶稣被当作罪犯对待一样，他们会把新讯息视为某种骗局。他们看不到什么是金，什么是石。</p>
<p>What can you do? What can God do? The Revelation must be given. And those who are meant to be a part of it, to benefit from it, must be called. This is many people now, not just a rare individual here and there.</p>
<p>你能做什么？上帝能做什么？必须给予启示。那些注定要成为其中一部分、从中受益的人必须被召唤。现在有许多人，而不仅仅是这里或那里的少数人。</p>
<p>This is the challenge being at the beginning, for the Messenger is in the world. Will you deny him? Will you repudiate him? Will you believe that he is false? Will you project upon him your fears and your beliefs? Or will you listen to hear?</p>
<p>这是一开始的挑战，因为信使就在这个世界。你会否认他吗？你会反驳他吗？你会相信他是假的吗？你会把你的恐惧和信仰投射到他身上吗？还是你会倾听？</p>
<p>The New Revelation is in the world. Will you deny it? Will you avoid it? Will you think it is just one of thousands of teachings?</p>
<p>新启示就在世上。你会否认它吗？你会避开它吗？你会认为它只是千万条教导之一吗？</p>
<p>You must listen with your heart here. For this is beyond your intellectual capacity. This is beyond your philosophy or theology, your ideas, your religions—everything. This is beyond human understanding. But what is truest about you, what is the reality of your life, what has sent you into the world is also beyond human understanding.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须用心聆听。因为这超出了你的智力范围。这超出了你的哲学或神学、你的想法、你的宗教——一切。这超出了人类的理解。但是，什么是你最真实的一面，什么是你生命的现实，什么让你来到这个世界，同样也超出了人类的理解。</p>
<p>So do not expect others to recognize it, to accept it, to encourage it, to applaud it, for this will not be the case. And this is what matures you and requires real self-trust and real faith that what is moving your life is for a greater purpose. It is not simply part of the chaotic condition of the world.</p>
<p>所以不要期望别人去认识它、接受它、鼓励它、赞扬它，因为事实并非如此。而这才是让你成熟的事情，需要真正的自我信任和真正的信念，相信推动你生命的是出于一个更伟大的目的。它不仅仅是世界混乱状况的一部分。</p>
<p>What is calling you up this great mountain is not your ambition or your psychology or anything else that you can understand immediately. [It is] something greater. And if you know someone else who is responding to something of this magnitude, you must support them. You must bear witness to them.</p>
<p>召唤你登上这座大山的不是你的野心、你的心理或任何你能立即理解的事情。[它是]更伟大的内识。如果你知道其他人正在对如此重大的事情做出回应，你必须支持他们。你必须为他们作证。</p>
<p>Do not think that this applies to everyone, for not everyone is being called. Do not worry that the condition of humanity is so depraved and so unfortunate that such a calling will have no impact, for you must look to yourself. You must look to your life. That is where the calling will happen. If it has not happened, that is where it will happen—not at the level of humanity. If you look at everyone else, you will always be discouraged here.</p>
<p>不要认为这适用于每个人，因为不是每个人都被召唤。不要担心人类的状况如此堕落、如此不幸，以至于这样的召唤不会产生影响，因为你必须审视你自己。你必须审视你的生命。这是召唤将发生的地方。如果它还没有发生，那就是它将发生的地方——不是在人类的层面。如果你看着其他人，你将永远在这里感到沮丧。</p>
<p>If you can begin to respond, others will be sent to help you. Some of them will only be with you very temporarily, even momentarily, but they will all be signs, pointing the way. Some will come just to encourage you to continue. Some will deliver messages to you.</p>
<p>如果你能开始回应，其他人就会来帮助你。他们中的一些人只会暂时陪伴你，甚至只是一瞬间，但他们都是指引方向的标志。有些人会来只是为了鼓励你继续前进。有些人会给你传递讯息。</p>
<p>Eventually, others will come to join you, to assist you in discovering your greater purpose and work here. This must be a matter of faith for you now, for perhaps only one or two of these occurrences have happened for you so far.</p>
<p>最终，其他人会加入你，帮助你发现你在此的更伟大目的和工作。现在这对你来说一定是个信仰问题，因为到目前为止，也许只有一两次这样的事情发生在你身上。</p>
<p>Wherever you are living, whatever culture, whatever your financial condition, this is the case. God does not just give to the rich and the privileged. In fact, the greatest individuals will come from far more impoverished conditions.</p>
<p>无论你生活在哪里，无论什么文化，无论你的经济状况如何，情况都是如此。上帝不会只给予富人和特权阶层。事实上，最伟大的人往往来自更贫困的环境。</p>
<p>The great Messengers have been born into humble families and into wealthy families. Each has its advantages, each has its disadvantages in terms of this greater calling, in terms of encountering their Spiritual Family and the greater calling that has brought them into the world.</p>
<p>伟大的信使们出生在卑微的家庭和富裕的家庭。就这个更伟大召唤而言，就遇见他们的精神家庭以及将他们带到世界的更伟大召唤而言，每个人都有其优势，每个人都有其劣势。</p>
<p>Gaining an awareness and understanding of what this idea of a Spiritual Family means represents just but one part of your greater education. And it is new for humanity. For you to relate to intelligent life in the universe, you must have this understanding of your Spiritual Family, or you will not understand who you are within this greater context. You will not see that you have greater associations even amongst other races in the universe.</p>
<p>觉知并理解精神家庭这个概念的意义，仅仅代表了你更伟大教育的一部分。这对人类来说是新的。为了与宇宙中的智能生命建立联系，你必须对你的精神家庭有这种理解，否则你将无法理解你在这个更伟大背景中是谁。你将看不到你甚至在宇宙中的其他种族中也有更伟大的联系。</p>
<p>You will still think like you are a part of a human tribe, only; that you are just a citizen of a state, only; that you are associated with a certain kind of industry in life, only; that your worldly family is all that you are and all that you need to be. You will think like this. You will not see you have greater connections, even beyond the human family itself.</p>
<p>你仍会认为你只是人类部落的一部分；你只是某个国家的公民；你只是与生活中的某种行业相关联；你的世俗家庭就是你的全部，也是你需要的一切。你会这样想。你不会看到你有更伟大的联接，甚至超越了人类大家庭本身。</p>
<p>For you to have this understanding, you must learn of the Greater Community. You must learn of your Spiritual Family. And only the New Message from God can reveal these things to you. For this is beyond human speculation, human philosophy and human ideas. It is not a human creation. It is a creation of God. It is a gift to humanity. And it has come at just the right time.</p>
<p>为了拥有这种理解，你必须理解大社区。你必须学习你的精神家庭。只有来自上帝的新讯息才能向你揭示这些。因为这超越了人类的推测、人类的哲学和人类的想法。它不是人类的创造。它是上帝的创造。它是给人类的礼物。它来得正是时候。</p>
<p>Therefore, begin your understanding with humility, not trying to fit all of this in with your old ideas or assumptions or beliefs. But instead set them aside, for this is something new. It is a New Revelation. The Revelation itself will teach you what you must learn to understand. And the greater movement of your life will show you what the journey really looks like and what it requires.</p>
<p>因此，带着谦逊开始你的理解，不要试图把这一切塞进你的旧想法、假设或信仰里。而是把它们放在一边，因为这是新的东西。它是一个新的启示。启示本身将教你你必须学会​​去理解的事情。你生命的更伟大运动将向你展示这段旅程真正是什么样子，以及它需要什么。</p>
<p>Here you will see that you have come into the world to serve humanity at a great turning point, perhaps the greatest turning point of all time—as humanity faces a world in decline, as humanity faces the reality of life in the universe.</p>
<p>在这里，你将看到你在一个伟大的转折点来到世界上服务人类，或许是有史以来最伟大的转折点——当人类面对一个衰落的世界时，当人类面对宇宙生命的现实时。</p>
<p>The New Message from God reveals these two great thresholds—what they mean and how they must be regarded. It is all the context for your greater life. It is why you are being called or will be called in the future. It is what gives reality and substance to your deeper nature and your greater reason for being here now.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息揭示了这两个伟大的门槛——它们意味着什么以及必须如何看待它们。这都是你更伟大生命的背景。这都是你被召唤或未来将被召唤的原因。这为你更深层次的自然以及你现在在此的更伟大理由赋予了现实和实质。</p>

But it is more complex than this. 人们很难信任上帝。基于对旧神、审判之神、谴责之神的观念，他们的不信任是有道理的。但实际情况远比这复杂得多。 For people do not know what to trust within themselves and one another,...</div></div></div></a></nav><div class="relatedPosts"><div class="headline"><i class="fas fa-thumbs-up fa-fw"></i><span>相关推荐</span></div><div class="relatedPosts-list"><a class="pagination-related" href="/2025/01/21/3-3.7%E4%BD%A0%E4%B8%8E%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E%E5%AE%B6%E5%BA%AD%E7%9A%84%E5%85%B3%E7%B3%BB/" title="第七章：你与精神家庭的关系"><img class="cover" src= "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-lazy-src="/img/64.webp" alt="cover"><div class="info text-center"><div class="info-1"><div class="info-item-1"><i class="far fa-calendar-alt fa-fw"></i> 2025-01-21</div><div class="info-item-2">第七章：你与精神家庭的关系</div></div><div class="info-2"><div class="info-item-1">Your Relationship With Your Spiritual Family As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 13, 1994 in Boulder, Colorado1994 年 10 月 13 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示  As you have relationships within the world, you have relationships beyond the world.
