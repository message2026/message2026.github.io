<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on November 23, 2007 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2007 年 11 月 23 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Around the world love is held to be in the highest esteem, as a pinnacle of human experience. Love is sung about in songs and written about in poetry. It is exalted in great literature. It is bandied about in normal conversation. People claim they are in love, that love is the ultimate, that all you need in the world is love and everything will work out just fine. But very few people understand what love really is. And very few people have experienced love at a deeper level—beyond fascination, beyond infatuation and attachment. Few people have experienced the real power and current of love.</p>
<p>世界各地都对爱推崇备至，认为爱是人类体验的巅峰。爱在歌曲中被歌颂，在诗歌中被书写。伟大的文学作品中对爱大加赞扬。在日常对话中，爱随处可见。人们声称自己恋爱了，爱是终极，世界上你需要的只是爱情，一切都会好起来。但很少有人真正理解爱是什么。很少有人体验过一种更深层次层面的爱——超越幻想、迷恋和依恋。很少有人体验过爱的真正力量和潮流。</p>
<p>In addition, many people associate certain kinds of behaviors, beliefs and attitudes with love. Gentleness and passivity are associated with love. Peace and harmony are associated with love. But really what is this deeper love, not a love that is simply a fixation, an infatuation or an attachment, but a deeper kind of love that is redemptive, that emanates from a deeper place within the individual?</p>
<p>此外，许多人将某些行为、信仰和态度与爱联系起来。温柔和被动与爱有关。和平与和谐与爱有关。但这种更深层次的爱到底是什么？它不是简单的迷恋、痴情或依恋，而是一种更深层次的救赎之爱，一种发自个人内心深处的爱？</p>
<p>Beyond this, what is God’s love, the love of God? Is this merely an infatuation, a fixation or an attachment? Most people will say no, but they are unclear what the love of God really means, how this love is expressed and how it can be translated into the world effectively.</p>
<p>除此之外，上帝的爱、对上帝的爱又是什么？这是否只是一种迷恋、一种执着或一种依恋？大多数人会说不是，但他们不清楚对上帝的爱到底意味着什么，这种爱如何表达，以及如何有效地转化为世界。</p>
<p>So today We will speak on love, the greater love that lives within each individual, and the greater love of God, that is the sum of all love in the universe, and is the source of all real love everywhere—in this world and in the Greater Community of worlds. And We shall speak about what God’s New Message for the world teaches about love, for there is a New Message from God in the world, and love is part of its Message.</p>
<p>因此，今天我们将谈论爱，谈论存在于每个人内心的更伟大的爱，谈论上帝更伟大的爱，这是宇宙中所有爱的总和，也是所有地方所有真爱的源泉——在这个世界和大社区中。我们将谈论上帝给世界的新讯息如何教导我们关于爱，因为世界上有一条来自上帝的新讯息，而爱是其讯息的一部分。</p>
<p>It is necessary here to begin by saying what love is not. Love is not fascination. Love is not fixation. Love is not attachment. Love is not romance where you are infatuated or taken with someone else’s appearance or some aspect of their personality. It is not idolatry, where you idolize someone, you worship someone—even a deity, even a messenger, even God. For these do not represent a real relationship, a working relationship, a relationship of united wills.</p>
<p>这里有必要先说说爱不是什么。爱不是迷恋。爱不是执着。爱不是依恋。爱不是浪漫，不是痴迷或被他人的外表或人格的某个方面所吸引。爱不是偶像崇拜，不是偶像化某人、崇拜某人——甚至崇拜神灵、信使、上帝。因为这些并不代表真正的关系、工作关系、团结意志的关系。</p>
<p>Love is not a behavior, an attitude or a mannerism. It is not etiquette. It is not convention. Love may express itself in many different ways—softly or forcibly. Love can appear meek. Love can appear strong. Love can challenge you. Love can criticize you. Love can expose your illusions, your fantasies and your self-deception. Love is not what people really mean when they talk about love in nearly all circumstances.</p>
<p>爱不是一种行为、态度或习惯。它不是礼仪。它不是习俗。爱可以用许多不同的方式表达它自身——温柔或强烈。爱可以显得温顺。爱可以显得坚强。爱可以挑战你。爱可以批评你。爱可以揭露你的幻想、你的妄想和你的自欺欺人。在几乎所有情况下，当人们谈论爱时，他们真正想表达的并不是爱。</p>
<p>Love is a deeper power that moves people to do things that are different from their ideas, their beliefs and their sense of obligation. Love is something beyond the love you hear about in conversations. In fact, it is better to demonstrate love than to talk about it, for real love is demonstrated. It is what moves people to change their lives, to refocus their priorities, to associate with something deeper and more profound within themselves. It is something that has the power to override human ambition, human selfishness, human grievance, all partisan beliefs and attitudes and religious ideology. For love is not bound by these things. It is only restrained, held back or hidden by these things. Love moves on its own accord, being associated with the deeper Knowledge that God has placed within each person.</p>
<p>爱是一种更深层次的力量，它推动人们去做与他们的想法、信仰和责任感不同的事情。爱超越了你在谈话中听到的爱。事实上，展示爱比谈论爱更好，因为真正的爱是展示出来的。它推动人们改变他们的生命，重新关注优先事项，与他们内心更深层次、更深刻的内识联系起来。它有能力超越人类的野心、人类的自私、人类的不满、所有的党派信仰和态度以及宗教意识形态。因为爱不受这些事物的束缚。它只是被这些事物限制、阻止或隐藏。爱自发地推动，与上帝放置在每个人内心的更深层次的内识相关联。</p>
<p>For you see, you were born with two minds—a mind to think with and a mind to know. The mind that you think with is a product of all of your social conditioning. It is a product of being in the world. It is an accumulation of ideas, associations and patterns of thinking that you have been learning since the day you were born. Much of this is useful, and some of it is hazardous and dangerous to you.</p>
<p>因为你看，你生来就有两个心灵——一种用来思考，一种用来知道。你用来思考的那一个心灵是你所有社会条件的产物。它是存在于这个世界的产物。它是你从出生那天起就一直在学习的想法、联想和思维模式的积累。其中许多是有用的，但有些对你来说是有害和危险的。</p>
<p>Certainly, you have had to learn how to survive in the world—how to survive physically, how to survive socially, how to participate within a family environment, within a culture and perhaps within a religious framework. You have had to learn how to communicate your ideas and feelings. You have had to learn what society has told you you have to learn. As We have said, some of this is useful and important, and some of this is hazardous and not in your best interests.</p>
<p>当然，你必须学会​​如何在世界上生存——如何在身体上生存，如何在社会上生存，如何在家庭环境、文化和宗教框架中参与。你必须学会​​如何交流你的想法和感受。你必须学习社会告诉你必须学习的东西。正如我们所说，其中一些是有用和重要的，而其中一些是危险的，不符合你的最佳利益。</p>
<p>But you were born with a deeper mind, the mind of Knowledge. This mind does not think like your intellect thinks. It sees and it knows. It is not what people think of when they talk about the subconscious mind. That is more associated with your worldly mind, or intellect. This deeper mind is not subject to conditioning in the world. It is not patterned or conditioned by the world. It is not threatened or intimidated by the world. This deeper mind is called Knowledge in the New Message because it is related to the experience of direct knowing, the experience of affinity, the experience of true recognition and the experience of true relationship.</p>
<p>但你生来就拥有一个更深层次的心灵，即内识的心灵。这个心灵的思考方式与你的智力不同。它看见并知晓。它不是人们在谈论潜意识时所想到的。那更多地与你的世俗心灵或智力有关。这个更深层次的心灵不受世界的制约。它不受世界模式化或制约。它不受世界威胁或恐吓。这个更深层次的心灵在新讯息中被称为内识，因为它与直接知道的体验、亲和力的体验、真正认知的体验和真正关系的体验相关。</p>
<p>Real love emanates from Knowledge. It in essence is the expression of Knowledge. When Knowledge moves you to do something—perhaps something you were never planning to do, something you do not understand, something that flies in the face of your plans and goals and ambitions—this expresses love because you are expressing the will of God, which is the love of God. For God’s love is not separate from God’s Will.</p>
<p>真正的爱源自内识。它本质上是内识的表达。当内识促使你去做某件事——也许是你从未计划做的事、你不理解的事、与你的计划、目标和抱负相悖的事——这就表达了爱，因为你表达的是上帝的意志，也就是上帝的爱。因为上帝的爱与上帝的意志是不可分割的。</p>
<p>God does not think like your intellect thinks—happy one day, sad the next, happy with this, angry with that, cruel and punishing over those who make mistakes or who live in error. This is not God. This is the human mind projecting a human mind onto God and projecting onto God human feelings and grievances. It is all a projection of the human mind. But God is beyond all this. And the love and the will of God is beyond all this.</p>
<p>上帝的思考与你智力的思考是不同的——今日的快乐，明日的悲伤，对这个高兴，对那个生气，对犯错或生活在错误中的人残忍和惩罚。这不是上帝。这是人类的心灵将人类的心灵投射到上帝身上，将人类的感情和不满投射到上帝身上。这都是人类心灵的投射。但上帝超越这一切。上帝的爱和意志超越这一切。</p>
<p>So if you live in your personal mind or what you could call your “surface mind,” all your notions of God are associated with your personal mind. You think that God is just a super personality, a huge gigantic intellect, but an intellect that is subject to fear and anxiety, to hatred and recrimination, to judgment and punishment, to fixed ideas, to righteousness and heresy. This is a God that people think thinks like them, acts like them and behaves like them.</p>
<p>因此，如果你活在个人的心灵或所谓的“表面心灵”中，你对上帝的所有观念都与你的个人心灵有关。你认为上帝只是一个超人，一个巨大无比的智力，但这个智力会受到恐惧和焦虑、仇恨和指责、审判和惩罚、固定观念、正义和异端的影响。人们认为这个上帝像他们一样思考、行动和举止。</p>
<p>But when you think about what God really is—God of the Greater Community, God of all intelligent life in the universe—certainly a God of the universe, of the Greater Community, cannot be conditioned by human beliefs, human attitudes, human emotions, human social conventions and all of the petty things that keep humanity in a primitive and undeveloped state.</p>
<p>可是当你思考上帝真正是什么——大社区的上帝，宇宙所有智能生命的上帝——当然，一个宇宙的上帝、大社区的上帝，不可能被人类的信仰、人类的态度、人类的情感、人类的社会习俗以及所有那些让人类处于原始和不发达状态的琐碎事物所制约。</p>
<p>If God is God of the Greater Community, then God is author of countless forms of intelligent life and of countless worlds where intelligent life has evolved. God is the author of evolution. God is the author and source of the expansion of the universe. God is the author of all scientific truth. God is the creator of countless races of beings who do not look like you, think like you or have your value system. God is the author of nature, which functions within the world and beyond the world and within all worlds in this universe and beyond—at all levels of manifestation. This is a God so great that it transcends all theological ideas, religious systems of belief and religious organizations.</p>
<p>如果上帝是大社区的上帝，那么上帝就是无数种智能生命形式和无数智能生命已经进化的世界的创造者。上帝是进化的创造者。上帝是宇宙扩张的创造者和源泉。上帝是所有科学真理的创造者。上帝是无数种族的创造者，他们长相不像你，思维不像你，价值体系也不像你。上帝是大自然的创造者，大自然在世界之内和世界之外以及这个宇宙和宇宙之外的所有世界之内运作——在所有显化层面上。这个上帝如此伟大，以至于超越了所有的神学思想、宗教信仰体系和宗教组织。</p>
<p>It is better to set aside your ideas of God and to follow what God has placed within you to follow, to see what God has placed within you to see, to hear what God has placed within you to hear. Only here can you experience God and experience your relationship with God. And ultimately, if you are successful in following the power and presence of Knowledge within yourself, you will discover God’s Will for you in this life, in this world, at this time.</p>
<p>最好是放下你对上帝的想法，遵循上帝放在你内心让你遵循的内识，看到上帝放置在你内心让你看到的事情，听到上帝放在你内心让你听到的声音。只有在这里你才能体验上帝，体验你与上帝的关系。最终，如果你成功地遵循了你内心内识的力量和存在，​​你就会发现上帝在今生、在这个世界、在这个时候对你的意志。</p>
<p>Because you cannot understand God, it means you cannot understand God’s Will. It also means you cannot understand God’s love, the love of God. But you can experience these things because God has given you a deeper, greater mind, the mind of Knowledge. You can speculate, you can theorize, you can establish elaborate systems of thought, elaborate mental constructions. But if you cannot experience the movement of Knowledge in your life and the wisdom of Knowledge in your life, which is giving you counsel all along—counsel which you cannot hear, counsel which you do not respond to because your attention is fixated on the surface, on your intellect and on your perception of the world—if you cannot feel this deeper movement, God is foreign to you. God is merely an idea which you can either accept or set aside.</p>
<p>因为你无法理解上帝，所以你无法理解上帝的意志。这也意味着你无法理解上帝的爱，上帝的爱。但你可以体验这些，因为上帝赋予了你一个更深层次、更伟大的心灵，即内识的心灵。你可以推测，你可以理论化，你可以建立复杂的思想体系，复杂的心理结构。但如果你无法体验你生命中内识的运动以及你生命中内识的智慧，它们一直在给你忠告——你听不到的忠告，你没有回应的忠告，因为你的注意力集中在表面、你的智力和你对世界的感知上——如果你无法感受到这种更深层次的运动，上帝对你来说就是陌生的。上帝只是一个你可以接受或抛在一边的想法。</p>
<p>God has placed an expression of God’s will and love within you, deep within you, deep beneath the intellect, a will and love you cannot control and which you cannot dominate. You cannot use it to gain wealth, power or influence. You can only submit to it. You can only follow it, learn from it and carry out what it gives you to do to re-establish your life, to rebuild your mind, to rebuild your health, to refocus your life and to re-establish a greater set of priorities for yourself and with them a greater opportunity for relationship with others.</p>
<p>上帝已经将上帝的意志和爱的表达放置在你的内心深处，在你的智力深处，这是你无法控制和主宰的意志和爱。你不能用它来获得财富、权力或影响力。你只能服从它。你只能遵循它，从中学习，并执行它给你的任务，以重建你的生命，重建你的心灵，重建你的健康，重新关注你的生命，重新为你自己建立一套更伟大的优先事项，并借此获得与他人建立关系的更伟大机会。</p>
<p>It is this greater love that is so far beyond and distinct from the love you hear about in conversation. People say, “I love this. I love him. I love her. I love this food. I love this place. I love your dress. I love nature. I love the woods. I love the ocean.”</p>
<p>这种更伟大的爱远远超出了你在谈话中听到的爱，也与爱截然不同。人们说：“我爱这个。我爱他。我爱她。我爱这种食物。我爱这个地方。我爱你的裙子。我爱大自然。我爱树林。我爱海洋。”</p>
<p>Real love is beyond all this—the real love that moves you to give your life, that refocuses your life, that tells you that you are in error, that confronts you with the fact that your life has been misspent and you are trying to take it in a direction that is not its true direction. This is love—the love that keeps orienting you towards your greater purpose for coming into the world regardless of your plans and goals, the love that does not change, the love that does not adapt to your wishes. This is the love! At times, it is confronting and challenging, and you feel that it is just too much. And at times, it is comforting and reassuring, and you welcome it and are so glad it exists and that it is true.</p>
<p>真爱超越了这一切——真爱激励你给予你的生命，重新聚焦你的生命，告诉你你犯了错误，让你面对生命被浪费的事实，而你正试图将生命引向一个并非其真正方向的方向。这就是爱——无论你的计划和目标如何，它始终引导你走向来到这个世界的更伟大目的，它不会改变，它不会适应你的愿望。这就是爱！有时，它是对抗性的、挑战性的，你觉得它太过分了。有时，它是安慰性的、令人安心的，你欢迎它，并很高兴它存在，很高兴它是真实的。</p>
<p>This is the Great Love—the love of God that has been placed in you, in Knowledge within you, in the deeper mind within you. This deeper mind is here on a mission. It is here for a purpose, for you have come into the world on a mission, for a purpose, to do specific things with specific people. Knowledge within you is trying to take you there, to aim you in the right direction so you can make your rendezvous with certain individuals and to find the circumstances and the environment where your greater purpose can emerge and can be activated. While people are making elaborate plans and are reinforcing what they are doing and what they believe, Knowledge within them is trying to take them somewhere.</p>
<p>这是伟大的爱——被放置在你内在的上帝的爱，被放置在你内在的内识之中，被放置在你内在更深层次的心灵中。这个更深层次的心灵在此肩负着一个使命。它在此是为了一个目的，因为你带着一个使命、一个目的来到这个世界，与特定的人做特定的事情。你内在的内识正试图带你去那里，引导你走向正确的方向，这样你就能与某些人会合，找到你的更伟大目的能够出现并被激活的境遇和环境。当人们在制定复杂计划、强化他们正在做的事情和他们所相信的事情时，他们内在的内识正试图带他们去某个地方。</p>
<p>Therefore, never think that people are always in the right place, doing what they should be doing. It is not true. This is just an excuse. It is what people say to make things okay, to make things all right, when in fact, their life is miscast. They are not where they need to be. They are functioning at a level that does not represent their greater purpose for coming here. Or they are circumscribed by poverty or political oppression where they are locked in place and cannot find another way.</p>
<p>因此，永远不要认为人们总是在正确的地方，做着他们应该做的事情。这不是真的。这只是一个借口。人们说这些话是为了让事情好起来，让事情好起来，但事实上，他们的生命被错误地安排了。他们没有处在他们需要去的地方。他们运作在一个不代表他们来到这里更伟大目的的层面上。或者他们受到贫困或政治压迫的束缚，被困在原地，无法找到另一种方式。</p>
<p>But God’s love is still resident within them. It will never give up. It is not like your intellect, in its shifting desires, its changing beliefs, its confusion and in its radical ideas and its fundamentalism. The only thing really fundamental within you is Knowledge because it is the only thing that is permanent within you. Knowledge is not circumscribed by religious ideology or by nationalistic passions. It cannot be used as a weapon. It cannot be used to oppress others. It cannot be used to divide and conquer. Knowledge can only be followed. It cannot be used.</p>
<p>但上帝的爱仍然驻留在他们心中。它永远不会放弃。它不像你的智力，有不断变化的欲望、改变的信仰、困惑、激进的想法和原教旨主义。你内心唯一真正根本的爱是内识，因为它是你内心唯一永恒的东西。内识不受宗教意识形态或民族主义激情的限制。它不能被用作武器。它不能被用来压迫他人。它不能被用来分裂和征服。内识只能被遵循。它不能被使用。</p>
<p>The mind must serve Spirit. It is not the other way around. People want God to do things for them, as if God is their servant. People want God to protect them from danger or catastrophe. They want God to deliver what they want for themselves, as if God is a kind of servant. This is where the mind wants Spirit to serve the mind. The intellect wants God to serve and reinforce the intellect. This is completely backwards. This is upside down. For in truth, your body is meant to serve the mind, and your mind is meant to serve Spirit or Knowledge, and Knowledge is here to serve God. That is the true hierarchy of your Being. That is the only arrangement where your integrity can be experienced and established, where you can find union within yourself.</p>
<p>心灵必须服务于精神。而不是相反。人们希望上帝为他们做事，仿佛上帝是他们的仆人。人们希望上帝保护他们免遭危险或灾难。他们希望上帝为他们提供他们想要的东西，仿佛上帝是一种仆人。这就是心灵希望精神服务于心灵的地方。智力希望上帝服务和强化智力。这是完全倒退的。这是颠倒的。因为事实上，你的身体注定要服务于心灵，你的心灵注定要服务于精神或内识，内识在此服务于上帝。这是你存在的真正层级。这是唯一能够体验和确立你的完整性的安排，这是你能够在你自己内在找到统一的地方。</p>
<p>Ultimately here, everything serves God because if the body serves the mind, and the mind serves the Spirit and the Spirit serves God, everything serves God. But to gain this integrity, to gain this inner harmony, this union of all aspects of yourself, require a great preparation—a preparation you cannot invent for yourself, a preparation that is not some kind of eclectic approach where you take what you like from this tradition and what you like from that tradition and you kind of patch it all together, based upon your preferences. This is merely using the Spirit to substantiate the mind. It is incorrect from beginning to end.</p>
<p>最终，一切都服务于上帝，因为如果身体服务于心灵，心灵服务于精神，精神服务于上帝，那么一切都服务于上帝。但是，要获得这种完整性，要获得这种内在的和谐，要获得你所有方面的统一，需要进行大量的准备——这种准备不是你自己发明的，这种准备不是某种折衷的方法，你从这个传统中取你喜欢的东西，从那个传统中取你喜欢的东西，然后根据你的喜好将它们拼凑在一起。这只是用精神来充实心灵。从头到尾都是错误的。</p>
<p>Knowledge will take you somewhere you could not take yourself. Knowledge will take you beyond your fears and your preferences because all preferences are based on fear—the fear of not having, the fear of being wrong, the fear of losing and the fear of death.</p>
<p>内识会带你去到你自己无法到达的地方。内识会带你超越你的恐惧和偏好，因为所有的偏好都是基于恐惧——对没有的恐惧、对错误的恐惧、对失去的恐惧和对死亡的恐惧。</p>
<p>In this world, there is much that has been accomplished in religion and in spirituality. If you could understand the evolution of life in other worlds, you would see how much humanity has achieved, despite its many errors. You would see that religion in this world has actually gone very far. You would see that other more technologically advanced races [in the universe] have lost all their religion and all their understanding of spirituality. They have become much more mechanical, much more rigid—based upon ideas, based upon their science, based upon their political dictates and social structure.</p>
<p>在这个世界上，宗教和精神性已经取得了许多成就。如果你能理解其他世界生命的进化，你就会看到人类尽管犯了许多错误，却取得了多大的成就。你会看到，这个世界的宗教实际上已经走得很远了。你会看到，宇宙中其他技术更先进的种族已经失去了他们的宗教和对精神性的所有理解。他们变得更加机械化，更加僵化——基于他们的想法、基于他们的科学、基于他们的政治指令和社会结构。</p>
<p>Do not think that religion in this world is a big mistake. It is actually the only thing that humanity has to offer the Greater Community at this point. What has been achieved in terms of personal freedom and spiritual awareness is actually very good in light of your position in the universe as a whole. This is an important understanding because humanity’s future will be in the Greater Community, and whether you will remain a free and self-determined race will be determined by your interactions with the Greater Community.</p>
<p>不要认为这个世界上的宗教是一个大错误。事实上，宗教是人类目前能够为大社区提供的唯一东西。考虑到你们在整个宇宙中的地位，在个人自由和精神觉知方面所取得的成就实际上是非常好的。这是一种重要的理解，因为人类的未来将在大社区中，而你们是否能继续成为一个自由和自决的种族将取决于你们与大社区的互动。</p>
<p>What is love? Love is the movement of Knowledge. Or said in other words, love is the Will of God expressing itself through you. Here love is associated with inspiration, where the mind is infused with Spirit, where the mind yields to Spirit, where the mind is directed by Spirit. Sometimes this happens spontaneously. Sometimes this happens at a time when you are extremely disappointed, and you hear something within yourself that provides hope when you feel hopeless.</p>
<p>爱是什么？爱是内识的运动。或者换句话说，爱是上帝的意志通过你表达出来。在这里，爱与灵感有关，心灵被精神注入，心灵屈服于精神，心灵受精神指引。有时这是自发发生的。有时这发生在你极度失望的时候，当你感到绝望时，你会听到你自己内心有某种东西给你带来希望。</p>
<p>But to gain access to Knowledge and to take the Steps to Knowledge require a very focused approach. This approach must be given by God because only God knows how you can reconnect your thinking [mind] and the deeper mind of Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>但要获得内识并开展内识进阶，需要一种非常专注的方法。这种方法必须由上帝赐予，因为只有上帝知道如何重新连接你的思维[心灵]以及你内在内识的更深层次的心灵。</p>
<p>There is much for your intellect to do and to consider, and even its great skills have not really been cultivated fully within people. But in this matter, you must receive the grace of God, which is the love of God. Your life is lost. You do not know who you are or what you are doing and you finally come to a point of disappointment where you realize that this is actually your condition and has been your condition all along, and God sends you the Steps to Knowledge. You may wish that God would give you a new job, a new relationship, a nicer body or that God would rid you of your difficulties. That is what people want God to do for them.</p>
<p>你的智力有许多事情要做、要考虑，甚至它的伟大技能也还没有在人们身上得到充分的培养。但在这件事上，你必须接受上帝的恩典，也就是上帝的爱。你的生命迷失了。你不知道你是谁，不知道你在做什么，最后你失望了，你意识到这实际上是你的状况，而且一直都是你的状况，上帝向你发送了内识的进阶。你可能希望上帝给你一份新的工作、一段新的关系、一个更好的身体，或者希望上帝让你摆脱困境。这就是人们希望上帝为他们做的事。</p>
<p>God sends people what can redeem them, not what they want. What they want will only perpetuate their condition and their disassociation and will only prevent them from gaining the opportunity to gain access to Knowledge. God and God’s love give what is needed for redemption.</p>
<p>上帝赐予人们能够救赎他们的事情，而不是他们想要的东西。他们想要的东西只会延续他们的状况和分离，只会阻止他们获得获得内识的机会。上帝和上帝的爱给予了救赎所需要的内识。</p>
<p>It is only when you realize that getting more of what you want will not make a difference, that you will turn to Knowledge. It is only when your plans for personal fulfillment are shown to be weak, fallible and unfulfilling that you will turn to Knowledge. Here profound disappointment is extremely important and holds a great opportunity for you. But extreme disappointment is what everyone wants to avoid, so they keep trying to plan and scheme and focus their life to get what they want. Their predicament is only deepened. Knowledge is speaking to them all along, but they cannot hear. They are not open to that. They want what they want. They are driven by fear and preference. And so love is unknown to them.</p>
<p>只有当你意识到得到更多你想要的东西不会有什么不同时，你才会转向内识。只有当你的个人成就计划被证明是软弱的、易犯错误的和无法实现的时，你才会转向内识。在这里，深刻的失望极其重要，为你提供了绝佳的机会。但极度的失望是每个人都想避免的，所以他们不断试图计划、策划并专注于他们的生命以获得他们想要的东西。他们的困境只会加深。内识一直在对他们说话，但他们听不到。他们对此不开放。他们想要他们想要的。他们被恐惧和偏好所驱使。因此他们不知道爱。</p>
<p>Love is what gives them what they want. Love is what looks good. Love is what feels good in the moment. And as a result, people’s notion of love becomes a source of their addictions. Love becomes kind of an addiction. You must have this person. You must live in this place. You must have this food. You must have this pleasure. You must have this drug.</p>
<p>爱能满足人们的愿望。爱看起来很美好。爱能让人瞬间感觉良好。因此，人们对爱的理解成为他们成瘾的根源。爱变成了一种成瘾。你必须拥有这个人。你必须住在这个地方。你必须吃这种食物。你必须享受这种快乐。你必须吸这种毒。</p>
<p>God’s love is the movement of Knowledge within you, for this movement is moving you in a direction [towards] your redemption and your fulfillment in the world. To find this redemption and fulfillment, you must be freed from those relationships and those obligations that are keeping you locked in your life. Redemption is not something you simply add on to your life or just another thing you are managing in your life. It is not simply an addition. It is your life.</p>
<p>上帝的爱是你内在内识的运动，因为这种运动正引导你走向你的救赎和你在世界上的成就。要找到这种救赎和成就，你必须摆脱那些将你禁锢在生命中的关系和义务。救赎不是你简单地添加到生命中的东西，也不是你在生命中管理的另一件事。它不仅仅是一种补充。它是你的生命。</p>
<p>Everything that Knowledge moves you to do, whether it be urging you to avoid something or urging you towards something, is all aimed towards your redemption. Your redemption means that you have connected your thinking mind with Knowledge. That is redemption. That is the beginning of real promise for you.</p>
<p>内识促使你去做的每件事，无论是促使你逃避某事还是促使你追求某事，都是为了你的救赎。你的救赎意味着你已经将你的思维心灵与内识连接起来。这就是救赎。这是你真正承诺的开始。</p>
<p>You are not redeemed to God. You have never been separated from God. God has no anger towards you. You have placed yourself in exile. You have entered a reality where God is not known, where God is forgotten, where God is about idolatry, belief and ritual. What redeems you is taking the Steps to Knowledge, connecting mind with Spirit, your thinking mind with the real power of Knowledge within you—not your beliefs about Spirit or spirituality or religion, but with the reality.</p>
<p>你没有被救赎归于上帝。你从未与上帝分离。上帝对你没有愤怒。你把你自己放逐了。你进入了一个不为人知、被遗忘、只关心偶像崇拜、信仰和仪式的现实。救赎你的是开展内识的进阶，将心灵与精神连接起来，将你的思维心灵与你内在的内识的真正力量连接起来——不是你对精神、精神性或宗教的信仰，而是与现实。</p>
<p>Many people cannot differentiate between their beliefs and reality. They think their beliefs are reality. “What I believe is what is real,” they say. “What I believe is the truth,” they say. “What I believe is God’s will,” they say. And yet the more adamant they are, the more it demonstrates that they are not yet connected to Knowledge. They have not yet been redeemed.</p>
<p>许多人无法区分他们的信仰和现实。他们认为他们的信仰就是现实。“我所相信的才是真实的，”他们说。“我所相信的才是真理，”他们说。“我所相信的才是上帝的意志，”他们说。然而他们越是固执，就越表明他们还没有与内识相连。他们还没有得到救赎。</p>
<p>The intellect must yield to what God has placed within you. What God has placed within you is the will and plan of God for your life, which is connected to the Will and Plan of God for all life—within this world, beyond this world and throughout the Greater Community of worlds in the universe in which you live. [This is] so big! When you see how big it is, you realize that your thoughts are never going to contain it or define it.</p>
<p>智力必须屈服于上帝放置在你内在的内识。上帝置于你内在的内识是上帝对你生命的意志和计划，它与上帝对所有生命的意志和计划相关——在这个世界之内，在这个世界之外，在你所生活的宇宙中的世界大社区中。[这]太大了！当你看到它有多大时，你意识到你的思想永远无法容纳它或定义它。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you is completely uniform. It is in complete harmony with Knowledge within everyone else. And that is why it is the great peacemaker in the world. Any real peace that has been fostered and established has come from Knowledge. Otherwise, peace agreements are really economic or political arrangements to restrain war and conflict. No peace has really been established. Peace is the result of people recognizing and connecting with each other, not simply trading over a boundary, not simply looking at each other from a distance, but learning to recognize and to communicate and relate to each other.</p>
<p>你内在的内识是完全统一的。它与每个人内在的内识完全和谐。正因为如此，它是世界上伟大的和平缔造者。任何被培育和建立的真正的和平都来自内识。否则，和平协议实际上就是为了抑制战争和冲突的经济或政治安排。和平并没有真正建立起来。和平是人们认知和相互连接的结果，不是简单地跨越边界进行贸易，不是简单地从远处看着对方，而是学会认识、沟通和相互联系。</p>
<p>With the growing population of the world as it is now, you have a great opportunity to establish human unity, a great necessity to establish human unity. Living in a world of diminishing resources, this growing population will have to unite for its own survival. The very condition of scarcity you are creating creates the greater impetus for human unity. This is all the work of Knowledge.</p>
<p>随着当今世界人口的增长，你们拥有建立人类团结的伟大机会，也拥有建立人类团结的伟大必要性。生活在资源日益减少的世界中，不断增长的人口必须团结起来才能生存。你们正在创造的稀缺条件为人类团结创造了更大的动力。这都是内识的工作。</p>
<p>God does not will that humanity have an overpopulated world, a world of diminishing resources. But Knowledge will continue to move people towards their redemption regardless of the circumstances. Even if you create a nightmare scenario, Knowledge within you and others will move you towards redemption.</p>
<p>上帝不希望人类拥有一个人口过剩、资源日益减少的世界。但内识将继续推动人们走向救赎，无论情况如何。即使你创造了一个噩梦般的场景，你和他人内在的内识也会推动你走向救赎。</p>
<p>God then is not the author of what you think and do. God is the author of your redemption. God is the source of the greater purpose that has brought you and every other person into the world. Anyone who can recover their ancient memory will experience the power and the authority of God. Anyone who can take the Steps to Knowledge to bring Knowledge into their awareness will experience the love of God.</p>
<p>那么，上帝并不是你所想所为的作者。上帝是你救赎的作者。上帝是将你和其他人带到这个世界的更伟大目的的源泉。任何能够恢复古老记忆的人都将体验到上帝的力量和权威。任何能够采取内识进阶将内识带入觉知的人都将体验到上帝的爱。</p>
<p>Love is like the air you breathe. You take it for granted. You never think about it. But you need it every moment. Love is here. Can you experience it? Knowledge is within you. It is quiet. It is also giving you counsel. Can you feel it? Can you hear it? Are you willing to go to it with your hands open, without demands, without beliefs, just go to it? “I go to God.” You go to God. “What is God’s will for me? What must I do in this situation? Should I be with this person? Yes or no? Should I go to this place? Yes or no? Should I engage in this activity? Yes or No?”</p>
<p>爱就像你呼吸的空气。你认为它是理所当然的。你从未想过它。但你每时每刻都需要它。爱就在这里。你能体验到它吗？内识就在你内心。它很安静。它也在给你忠告。你能感觉到它吗？你能听到它吗？你愿意张开双手走向它，不加要求，不加信仰，只是走向它吗？“我去找上帝。”你去找上帝。“上帝对我的意志是什么？在这种情况下我必须做什么？我应该和这个人在一起吗？是还是不是？我应该去这个地方吗？是还是不是？我应该从事这项活动吗？是还是不是？”</p>
<p>Everything is simple. No deals. No compromises. “Well, I’ll do a little of this, if God gives a little of that. I’ll make a deal with God.” No deals. You are either open to guidance or you are not. You are either willing to put in doubt what you want for yourself or you are not. This does not mean that you surrender yourself to God. That happens perhaps much later. This is just a little opening, a little willingness, a beginning. You have to begin as a beginner. You cannot simply leap into a mature state in your relationship with God. You have to take the steps. God provides the steps.</p>
<p>一切都很简单。没有交易。没有妥协。“好吧，如果上帝给你一点那个，我就做一点这个。我跟上帝做个交易。”没有交易。你要么愿意接受指导，要么不愿意。你要么愿意怀疑你自己想要什么，要么不愿意。这并不意味着你把你自己交给了上帝。那可能要等到很久以后。这只是一个小小的开端，一点意愿，一个开始。你必须从初学者开始。你不能简单地跳到你与上帝的关系的成熟状态。你必须迈出步伐。上帝会提供步骤。</p>
<p>Love is the movement of Knowledge within you. Knowledge is the greater intelligence that God has placed within you to guide, to protect and to lead you to the discovery of your greater purpose in this world at this time. Everything else that calls itself love is just a parade. It has no devotion in it. It has no wisdom in it. It is without substance. Life will not support it.</p>
<p>爱是你内在内识的运动。内识是上帝放置在你内在的更伟大的智能，用来指导、保护你并引领你发现你此刻在这个世界中的更伟大目的。其他一切自称为爱的东西都只是一场游行。它里面没有奉献。它里面没有智慧。它没有实质。生命不会支持它。</p>
<p>That is why people fall in love, begin a relationship and then find out in the relationship if they can even be in the relationship, which often they cannot. So where is the love? What is the love here? Just an initial fascination? An attachment to something you think is going to save you or make you what you want to be?</p>
<p>这就是为什么人们会坠入爱河，开始一段恋情，然后在这段恋情中发现他们是否能继续这段恋情，而这往往是他们无法做到的。那么爱在哪里呢？这里的爱是什么？只是最初的迷恋？对某件你认为会拯救你或让你成为你想成为的人的东西的依恋？</p>
<p>People grow old. They lose their beauty. They lose their charm. Life confronts you with difficulties and requirements. You must produce. You must work. You must deal with adversity. What happened to the love back there at the beginning that was so ecstatic and wonderful? Then what people think was love becomes kind of a survival arrangement or convenience.</p>
<p>人会变老，会失去美丽，会失去魅力。生命会给你带来困难和要求。你必须生产，必须工作，必须应对逆境。当初那令人欣喜和美好的爱去哪了？后来人们认为的爱变成了一种生存安排或便利。</p>
<p>There is a greater love. There is the Great Love, the love that God has placed within you, within every person, waiting to be discovered, waiting to be expressed and experienced. This love does not have only one appearance. It is not associated with a certain kind of behavior or etiquette. It is not a social convention. This love will pull you away from danger. This love will challenge your thinking and your attitudes. This love will show you that your life is going nowhere. This love will move you to go one way when you want to go another. This love will restrain you. This love will redirect you. This is a Great Love. This is the real thing!</p>
<p>还有一种更伟大的爱。有一种伟大的爱，上帝放置在你内心的爱，放在每个人内心的爱，等待着被发现，等待着被表达和体验。这种爱不只有一种表象。它与某种行为或礼仪无关。它不是一种社会习俗。这种爱会把你从危险中拉出来。这种爱会挑战你的思维和态度。这种爱会告诉你，你的生命没有方向。当你想走一条路时，这种爱会把你拉向另一条路。这种爱会约束你。这种爱会引导你重新定向。这是一种伟大的爱。这是真正的爱！</p>
<p>Even if you are all alone in life, if you can feel the movement of Knowledge, you will feel the love of God. You will not understand it. You will not be sure where it is taking you. You will not be sure what it means. But if you can follow it, you will experience it. And step by step, increment by increment, it will move your life into a different position and open a greater opportunity for you.</p>
<p>即便你在生命中孤身一人，如果你能感受到内识的运动，你就会感受到上帝的爱。你不会理解它。你不确定它会带你去哪里。你不确定它意味着什么。但如果你能追随它，你就会体验到它。一步一步，一点一点，它会把你的生命带向一个不同的位置，为你打开一个更伟大的机会。</p>
<p>Here you must practice patience and forbearance. You must suspend judgment and delay your need for conclusions because you need to receive from God. Before you can give what God has given you to give, you must receive from God. You must let God redeem your life.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须练习耐心和忍耐。你必须暂停判断，推迟你对结论的需求，因为你需要从上帝那里得到。在你能够给予上帝赋予你的东西之前，你必须从上帝那里得到。你必须让上帝救赎你的生命。</p>
<p>Some people think that redemption is just assuming a belief system: “I am redeemed because I now believe!” But this is not redemption. Belief is weak and fallible. It has to constantly be reinforced. It does not have the power of Knowledge. It is a human invention. You will have to have faith in Knowledge within yourself, but even here you realize that Knowledge is greater than your understanding. Where Knowledge is taking you is beyond your current awareness. If you can follow, you can find. If you can find, you can fulfill. If you can fulfill, you can express.</p>
<p>有些人认为救赎只是假设一个信仰体系：“我被救赎了，因为我现在相信了！”但这不是救赎。信仰是脆弱的，是会犯错的。它必须不断地被强化。它没有内识的力量。它是人类的发明。你必须对你自己内在的内识有信仰，但即使在这里，你也会意识到内识比你的理解更伟大。内识带你去的地方超出了你目前的觉知。如果你能跟随，你就能找到。如果你能找到，你就能实现。如果你能实现，你就能表达。</p>
<p>This is the Great Love. And the need for this Great Love is immense. Look at the world around you. So many people. So much difficulty. So much danger, with greater danger threatening on the horizon. Where is the Great Love? In your life, with all of your busy-ness and activities, your preoccupations and concerns, your grievances, your fixations, where is the Great Love—the Great Love that stirs you and moves you and connects you? This is what you must receive, [this] is the love of God, which is the movement of Knowledge. This is how God will redeem you. You have been trying to redeem yourself, but this is how God will redeem you.</p>
<p>这就是伟大的爱。对这种伟大的爱的需求是巨大的。看看你周围的世界。这么多人。这么多困难。这么多危险，更大的危险正在逼近。伟大的爱在哪里？在你的生命中，在你所有的忙碌和活动、你的执着和担忧、你的不满和执着中，伟大的爱在哪里——激励你、推动你、联结你的伟大的爱？这就是你必须接收的，这是上帝的爱，这是内识的运动。这就是上帝救赎你的方式。你一直在努力救赎你自己，但这就是上帝救赎你的方式。</p>
<p>Take everything you are doing in life, and you ask yourself, “Fundamentally, is this what I really need to be doing?” Every relationship, “Is this relationship helping me? Is it important for me now?” Everything! And you will have a deeper sense of it coming from Knowledge, way deep inside of you. Perhaps it will be a feeling. Perhaps it will be an image. Perhaps the answer will come a week from now. You have to keep asking and listening.</p>
<p>把你生命中所做的每一件事都问你自己：“从根本上说，这是我真正需要做的吗？”每一段关系，“这段关系对我有帮助吗？它现在对我重要吗？”每件事！你会从你内心深处的内识中得到更深刻的感受。也许这是一种感觉。也许这是一个形象。也许答案会在一周后出现。你必须继续询问和倾听。</p>
<p>You are asking for the Great Love to redeem you, to reunite you and to put you in a position where your greater gifts can be realized and given to the world. This requires that you be in certain circumstances, associated with certain people, in certain environments. If you are not in the right environment with the right people, the discovery will not take place. Where you are physically is very important in this regard. Who you are with is very important in this regard.</p>
<p>你在请求伟大的爱来救赎你，让你重新团结，让你处于一个可以实现你的伟大礼物并交给世界的位置。这要求你处于某些境况中，与某些人联系在一起，处于某些环境中。如果你没有在正确的环境中与正确的人相处，那么发现就不会发生。在这方面，你身处何方非常重要。在这方面，你和谁在一起非常重要。</p>
<p>If your realization is going to happen in a particular city regarding certain people there and you are not in that city, how will the discovery take place? Even if you are in the right place, how are you going to find the right people? You cannot figure this out. This is too big for the intellect. Only Knowledge can take you there. Knowledge can bring two people from opposite ends of the world together for a greater purpose. That is the power of the Great Love. And the Great Love is what the world needs now.</p>
<p>如果你的认知发生在某个特定的城市，涉及那里的某些人，而你却不在那座城市，那么这一发现将如何发生呢？即使你在正确的地方，你又如何找到正确的人呢？你无法弄清楚。这太过复杂，超出了智力的理解范围。只有内识可以带你到达那里。内识可以将来自世界两端的两个人聚集在一起，实现更伟大的目的。这就是伟大爱的力量。而伟大的爱正是当今世界所需要的。</p>
