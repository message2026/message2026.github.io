<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 7, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 10 月 7 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You live in a mental environment as well as a physical environment. The physical environment is the world that your senses report—a world that you can see, hear, touch and feel; a world that you must navigate using your intellect and your physical skills. But the mental environment is more subtle. It is the environment of thought and influence.</p>
<p>你生活在一个心理环境和一个物理环境中。物理环境是你的感官所报告的世界——一个你能够看到、听到、触摸到和感受到的世界；一个你必须运用你的智力和你的身体技能去探索的世界。但心理环境更加微妙。它是思想和影响力的环境。</p>
<p>Go into any home or place of business and you will experience the unique mental environment of that place. This is part of your daily experience. People describe this in many ways, of course. But fundamentally they are feeling something very different being in different environments.</p>
<p>走进任何家庭或商业场所，你都会感受到那里独特的心理氛围。这是你日常生活的一部分。当然，人们对此有很多描述。但从根本上说，他们在不同的环境中感受到的是截然不同的感受。</p>
<p>If you were able to go into every house on any street, you would find a unique mental environment within their home, depending upon the nature of the relationships that exist there and the mental health of those who live there. Whenever you have a private conversation with someone, you create your own mental environment with that person. Here even in a restaurant, you can go from table to table, and there is a slight mental environment created at each one.</p>
<p>如果你能走进任何一条街上的每一户人家，你会发现他们家里都有一种独特的心理环境，这取决于那里关系的性质以及居住者的心理健康状况。每当你与某人进行私人交谈时，你都会与对方共同创造你们自己的心理环境。即使在餐厅里，你从一张桌子走到另一张桌子，每张桌子都会创造出一种微妙的心理环境。</p>
<p>Ultimately, you as an individual create a mental environment around you, depending upon the nature of your thinking and emotions. Here people walk around with a cloud over them, enveloped in their own fear, anxiety or resistance. Or they can create much the opposite—there is a feeling of openness, trust and safety around them.</p>
<p>最终，你作为个体，会根据你的思维和情绪的自然，在自身周围创造一种心理环境。在这里，人们仿佛笼罩着一层阴云，被他们自身的恐惧、焦虑或抵触所笼罩。或者，他们也可以创造出截然相反的景象——周围弥漫着一种开放、信任和安全的感觉。</p>
<p>While you create your own mental environment to a slight degree, you are living in the mental environment that everyone is creating and continues to create every moment of every day. This is the world that humanity has created, not only as a physical landscape, but as a complex and immense mental environment as well.</p>
<p>当你在轻微程度上创造你自己的心理环境时，你正生活在每个人都在创造、并且每时每刻都在持续创造的心理环境中。这是人类创造的世界，它不仅是一个物质景观，更是一个复杂且庞大的心理环境。</p>
<p>It is within this larger environment that there are powerful influences—cultural influences, political influences, commercial influences, religious influences and the influences of powerful individuals in one’s life.</p>
<p>正是在这个大环境中，存在着强大的影响力——文化的影响、政治的影响、商业的影响、宗教的影响以及一个人生活中强大个体的影响。</p>
<p>Here there are no neutral mental environments. For that, you must seek refuge in nature. But even in nature there can be subtle differences in environments, depending upon the creatures that live there and other forces in the mental environment that are beyond your visible range. People, however, generally seek refuge in nature to experience a neutral mental environment, an environment that is not activated or strongly influenced by human thought, feelings and emphasis.</p>
<p>这里没有中性的心理环境。为此，你必须在自然中寻求庇护。但即使在自然中，环境也可能存在微妙的差异，这取决于生活在那里的生物，以及心理环境中超出你可见范围的其他力量。然而，人们通常寻求自然的庇护，是为了体验一种中性的心理环境，一种不受人类思想、感受和强调所激活或强烈影响的环境。</p>
<p>People know very little about the mental environment, of course, and so they often lack discernment here and discretion. They become involved with people or environments that are generally unhealthy for them because there are no neutral mental environments where people are concerned.</p>
<p>当然，人们对心理环境知之甚少，因此他们往往缺乏辨识力和判断力。他们与那些通常对他们不健康的人或环境纠缠不清，因为在人们关注的地方，不存在中立的心理环境。</p>
<p>Here who you associate with has a great bearing on your thoughts, your feelings and the degree to which you can become aware of yourself and your environment. Everyone is influencing everyone, but particularly those people with whom you are directly engaged. You can be in a mental environment, working there or living there or spending a great deal of time there, and the mental environment itself can have a profound influence upon you.</p>
<p>在这里，你与谁交往，对你的思想、你的感受，以及你对你自己和环境的觉知程度有着重大影响。每个人都在影响着每个人，尤其是那些与你直接互动的人。你可能身处一个心理环境，在那里工作、生活或在那里度过大量时间，而这个心理环境本身能够对你产生深远的影响。</p>
<p>If you spend much time with a group of people who have a particular point of view, which they reinforce for one another, you will find yourself over time being persuaded by their point of view, and may even adopt it yourself. If you spend time with a group of people who are highly critical of the government, for example, you will find yourself falling into their line of thinking. This is part of your social adaptation, but it is also the influence in the mental environment there.</p>
<p>如果你花大量时间与一群持有特定观点、并且彼此相互强化的人相处，你会发现你自己随着时间的推移会被他们的观点所说服，甚至可能你自己也采纳这些观点。例如，如果你与一群对政府持强烈批评态度的人相处，你会发现你自己会陷入他们的思维模式。这是你社会适应的一部分，但也是当地心理环境的影响。</p>
<p>You live in a sea of persuasion—everywhere around you, occurring on so many different levels. People are often greatly influenced by one other person in their life, or by their parents, someone whose influence and sway are inordinate and very strong, and they are given to submit to it. Here you may even find yourself feeling constantly overshadowed by someone else because in the dynamic of your relationship with them, you tend to yield and they tend to dominate. Sometimes this is unexpected and unanticipated. It is just the dynamic of the relationship.</p>
<p>你生活在一片说服的海洋之中——在你周围无处不在，发生在如此多不同的层面。人们常常深受他们生命中另一个人或父母的影响，这些人的影响力和支配力异常强大，而他们却不得不屈服于此。在这里，你甚至可能发现你自己不断地被他人的阴影所笼罩，因为在你与他们的关系动态中，你倾向于屈服，而他们倾向于支配。有时，这种情况会出乎你的意料之外。这只是关系的动态而已。</p>
<p>Certainly, a marriage and a family create a powerful mental environment, an environment of influence. In this regard, whoever you marry is really who you are choosing to be your primary influence in your life.</p>
<p>当然，婚姻和家庭会创造出一种强大的心理环境，一个充满影响力的环境。从这个意义上来说，你与谁婚姻，实际上就是你选择谁来成为你生命中最重要的影响力。</p>
<p>In people’s romantic pursuits, of course, this is almost never considered. But this is a chief factor in determining whether someone is an appropriate partner for you. You will be assigning them the role as your chief and primary influence if you unite with them in marriage or partnership. Do not think you are going to rehabilitate them through association with you. That is a very common mistake.</p>
<p>当然，在人们的浪漫追求中，这一点几乎从未被考虑过。但这却是决定某人是否适合你的主要因素。如果你与他们结为婚姻或伴侣，你就将他们视为你最主要的、最重要的影响者。不要认为通过与你的交往就能让他们改邪归正。这是一个非常常见的错误。</p>
<p>Who you surround yourself with represents your chief influences. Just as a political leader will surround themselves with a group of advisors who have great bearing on that individual’s decision making and perception, you as an individual surround yourself with people who will become your chief advisors and influences. Even if you do not wholly respect or agree with their views, they will still have great bearing on your own. This is the power of influence in the mental environment.</p>
<p>你身边的人代表着你的主要影响力。正如政治领袖会身边围绕着一群对其决策和认知有着巨大影响的顾问一样，你作为个体，身边也会围绕着一些会成为你主要顾问和影响者的人。即使你并不完全尊重或认同他们的观点，他们仍然会对你产生巨大的影响。这就是心理环境中影响力的力量。</p>
<p>Do not think here that you as an individual, by the sheer intensity of your will or by living defensively, that you can overcome all of these influences upon you. That is underestimating the power of the mental environment. And do not think that you can create your own reality to a very great extent here beyond trying to change the way you interpret your experiences because you are living in the reality that so many other people are creating along with you.</p>
<p>在这里，不要认为你作为一个个体，仅仅凭借你的意志力，或者通过防御性地生活，就能克服所有这些对你的影响。这是低估了心理环境的力量。不要认为你能够在很大程度上创造你自己的现实，在这里，除了试图改变你解读你体验现实的方式之外，没有现实，因为你正在与许多人一起生活在他们所创造的现实中。</p>
<p>This is one of the ways that people enter into fantasy or illusion. They create a set of ideas or expectations and reinforce these to such an extent that they are disassociated from the environment around them. But what they fail to see is that their disengagement does not mean that the general environment is not continuing to influence them significantly.</p>
<p>这是人们陷入幻想或幻觉的方式之一。他们会创造一系列想法或期望，并不断强化这些想法或期望，以至于他们与周围的环境脱节。但他们没有看见，他们的脱离并不意味着整体环境不再对他们产生重大影响。</p>
<p>If you spend time with people who are unsuccessful in any regard, you will begin to share their attitudes and their experiences. Do not think that you alone can uplift them or alter their thinking and behavior. The collective intentions of others is greater than your individual intention in this regard. As a result, your ability to achieve goals or success in life will be greatly dependent upon those individuals with whom you surround yourself and who have a chief influence or function in your life.</p>
<p>如果你花时间与那些在任何方面都不成功的人相处，你就会开始分享他们的态度和经验。不要认为你一个人就能提升他们，或改变他们的思维和行为。在这方面，其他人的集体意图远大于你个人的意图。因此，你能否实现在生命中的目标或取得成功，很大程度上取决于你身边那些对你的生命产生主要影响或作用的人。</p>
<p>This is the unseen power of the mental environment. Never underestimate it. It has a greater impact upon your thoughts and feelings than even the physical environment that you can see and discern with your senses.</p>
<p>这就是心理环境的无形力量。永远不要低估它。它对你的思想和情感的影响，甚至比你用感官所能看到和辨别的物理环境还要大。</p>
<p>Here you can begin to recognize the value of your own experience. For you have experienced many different kinds of mental environments, some of which were attractive and some of which were not and some of which were just confusing. You did not know how to interpret them.</p>
<p>在这里，你可以开始认识到你自身经验的价值。因为你体验过许多不同类型的心理环境，有些很吸引人，有些则不然，有些则令人困惑。你不知道该如何解读它们。</p>
<p>Being with certain people felt good. With others it did not. Sometimes it even was felt to be dangerous. This is part of your experience of living in the world. If you are more sensitive to these things, then your experience of the mental environment is more pronounced. This could be helpful to you if you learn to develop skill in the mental environment, which is something that very few people have achieved to any degree whatsoever.</p>
<p>和某些人在一起感觉很好。和其他人在一起感觉不好。有时甚至会觉得危险。这是你活在世上的经历的一部分。如果你对这些事情更敏感，你对心理环境的体验就会更强烈。如果你学会培养在心理环境中的技巧，这可能会对你有所帮助，而这恰恰是很少有人能够达到的。</p>
<p>Sometimes people that you meet are very attractive. They seem powerful or charming or very determined, and you are attracted to this aspect of them. Perhaps there are other qualities about them that are not so impressive at the outset that end up being critically important for you to discern. Should you pursue a relationship with this person for any reason, whether it be for personal companionship or for goals in your work, you will find that these unforeseen tendencies will have a great bearing on the outcome.</p>
<p>有时你遇到的人非常有魅力。他们看起来强大、迷人或意志坚定，而你被他们的这些特质所吸引。或许他们身上还有其他一些品质，一开始并不那么引人注目，但最终却对你至关重要，需要你去发现。无论你出于何种原因与这个人建立关系，无论是为了个人友谊还是为了工作目标，你都会发现，这些意想不到的特质会对结果产生重大影响。</p>
<p>If you observe people objectively without condemnation, without criticism, they will tell you a great deal about themselves. And if you learn about their past experience—what they have achieved, what they have not achieved, how they have dealt with uncertainty, how they have dealt with loss and disappointment, how they view their past relationships and so forth—you will learn a great deal about how they will function in the future and whether or not you should become engaged with them.</p>
<p>如果你客观地观察人们，不带谴责、不带批评，他们将会告诉你很多关于他们自己的事情。如果你了解他们过去的经历——他们取得了什么成就，他们没有取得什么成就，他们如何应对不确定性，他们如何应对损失和失望，他们如何看待他们过去的关系等等——你将了解到很多关于他们未来将如何运作，以及你是否应该与他们进行参与的信息。</p>
<p>Part of this is based upon their appearance, of course, and their behavior and the nature of their communication. But then there is the more subtle experience of someone. Someone can appear to be quite attractive in all the normal respects, but there is something about them that gives you caution, that makes you feel reserved, that is like a warning. If you do not look at someone with this greater sensitivity or heed the sense of restraint you might feel around them, you could make a critical mistake in participating with that person. And, of course, these mistakes are made continuously everywhere, in all realms of human engagement.</p>
<p>当然，这部分取决于他们的外貌、行为以及交流的自然。但此外，还有对某人更微妙的体验。某人可能在所有正常的方面都显得颇具吸引力，但他们身上却有某种东西让你感到谨慎，让你感到矜持，就像一种警告。如果你不以这种更敏锐的洞察力看待某人，或者不留意你在他们身边可能感受到的拘谨，你就可能在与此人交往时犯下致命的错误。当然，这些错误在人类交往的所有领域中无处不在、不断发生。</p>
<p>In innumerable ways people are trying to influence each other to achieve their goals and to get what they want. Sometimes this self-serving attitude is very overt. It is very obvious. People are manipulating others or trying to manipulate you to get you to buy what they want you to buy, or do what they want you to do, or to surrender to them or to agree with their point of view, or to join their political cause, or to adopt their own set of views.</p>
<p>人们试图以无数种方式相互影响，以实现目标，得到他们想要的东西。有时，这种自私自利的态度非常明显，显而易见。人们操纵他人或试图操纵你，让你买他们想让你买的东西，做他们想让你做的事情，屈服于他们，认同他们的观点，加入他们的政治事业，或者采纳他们自己的一套观点。</p>
<p>But even in more subtle ways, people want their relationships to support their goals. So it is very important in relationships that you become acquainted with the other person’s goals, not only the goals that they proclaim, but their more subtle ambitions as well.</p>
<p>但即使在更微妙的方式中，人们也希望他们的关系能够支持他们的目标。因此，在人际关系中，了解对方的目标至关重要，不仅是他们宣称的目标，还有他们更微妙的抱负。</p>
<p>Skill and discernment here are critically important. For failure in life largely occurs as a result of being with the wrong people, of not discerning the nature of the relationship fully, of not discerning the problems and the warning signs. It is fundamentally a problem of not following the deeper Knowledge that lives within you.</p>
<p>在这里，技巧和辨别力至关重要。因为生命的失败很大程度上源于与错误的人相处，源于未能充分辨识关系的自然，源于未能辨识问题和警示信号。从根本上来说，问题在于未能遵循你内在更深层次的内识。</p>
<p>The real secret here to being able to avoid manipulation and to avoid making critical mistakes in your relationships and in engagements with others is the discovery of Knowledge within yourself. Knowledge represents the deeper Mind within you, a Mind very unlike the mind that you think with; the mind that you use to speculate and compare, contrast and criticize. The deeper Mind within you is quiet. It is discerning. It is watchful. It is not conflicted, and it is not afraid of the world.</p>
<p>在这里，能够避免被操控，避免在你的人际关系和与他人的交往中犯下关键错误的真正秘诀，是发现你内在的内识。内识代表着你内在更深层次的心灵，一个与你用来思考的心灵截然不同的心灵；一个你用来推测、比较、对照和批评的心灵。你内在更深层次的心灵是安静的。它辨识。它警觉。它不冲突，它不惧怕世界。</p>
<p>It is so very different from your intellect, your social mind, your mind that has been conditioned by your environment, your family and your culture. There is really no comparison here. Knowledge is the Mind that God created in you. But your surface mind where you live every day is the mind the world has created in you. It represents the chief influences of your culture, and your responses and reactions to the world. It contains your desires, your fears, your regrets, your hostilities, your unforgiveness, your tendencies, areas where you are aware, areas where you are not aware and so forth.</p>
<p>它与你的智力、你的社会心灵、以及你被你的环境、你的家庭和你的文化所熏陶的心灵截然不同。这里真的没有可比性。内识是上帝在你内在创造的心灵。但你每天生活的表面心灵，是世界在你内在创造的心灵。它代表着你的文化的主要影响，以及你对世界的回应和反应。它包含着你的渴望、你的恐惧、你的遗憾、你的敌意、你的不原谅、你的倾向、你察觉的领域、你未察觉的领域等等。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you cannot be fooled, and it is immune from the forces of persuasion, wherever they might come from. This is the source of your strength, your integrity, your discernment and your personal power in the world. God has given you this perfect guiding Intelligence to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to the discovery of the greater purpose that has brought you into the world, and those key relationships that will be essential in helping you to discover and to express this greater purpose.</p>
<p>你内在的内识无法被愚弄，它不受任何说服力量的影响，无论它们来自何方。这是你的力量、你的完整性、你的辨别力以及你在世界上的个人力量的源泉。上帝赋予了你这个完美的指引智能，来指引你、保护你并引领你去发现将你带到这个世界的更伟大目的，以及那些在帮助你发现和表达这个更伟大目的方面至关重要的关键关系。</p>
<p>This is the great endowment from the Creator of all life. It will protect you in the mental environment because only Knowledge is free in the mental environment. It is not influenced by conventional thinking or religious views or government proclamations. It is not persuaded by powerful individuals who hold sway over you. It is not seduced by fear or desire or preference. It is beyond the dichotomy of love and fear, which is very confusing for most people since most people really do not understand what love is or what fear is, or where these come from.</p>
<p>这是来自所有生命创造者的伟大恩赐。它将在心理环境中保护你，因为在心理环境中唯有内识是自由的。它不受传统思维、宗教观点或政府宣言的影响。它不受那些左右你的强大个体的说服。它不受恐惧、渴望或偏好的诱惑。它超越爱与恐惧的二分法，这对大多数人来说非常令人困惑，因为大多数人真的不理解爱是什么，恐惧是什么，或者它们从何而来。</p>
<p>In order for you to think freely, creatively and independently, you must have Knowledge as your foundation. Otherwise, you are just mimicking other people, your culture or your circle of friends, your network of people that you identify with or associate with. Together you just reinforce each other’s preferences and prejudices. You reinforce each other’s weaknesses and blindness. You gather together for security and for reinforcement. You see this all around you, of course, as different groups of people associate with each other and reinforce each other’s perception of the world.</p>
<p>为了让你能够自由、创造性和独立地思考，你必须以内识为基础。否则，你只是在模仿其他人，你的文化或你的朋友圈，你认同或交往的人脉网络。你们在一起只会强化彼此的偏好和偏见。你们强化彼此的弱点和盲目。你们聚集在一起是为了安全感，也是为了强化。当然，你周围随处可见这种情况，不同的人群彼此联系，强化彼此对世界的感知。</p>
<p>But Knowledge within you really is the source of your clarity and your integrity as an individual. And yet it connects you with the Creator of all life because Knowledge is connected to God—not in a religious sense, not in the sense of religious teachings or religious institutions, for Knowledge will guide you whether you are participating in a religious faith tradition or not. It will guide you no matter what your religious faith, or even if you do not adhere to a religious faith.</p>
<p>可是你内在的内识确实是你作为个体的清晰和完整性的源泉。然而它却将你与所有生命的创造者联接，因为内识联接着上帝——并非以宗教意义，并非以宗教教义或宗教机构的意义，因为内识将指引你，无论你是否参与一个宗教信仰传统。无论你的宗教信仰是什么，甚至即使你不信奉宗教信仰，它都将指引你。</p>
<p>The Creator of all life is not bound by human understanding or human institutions or traditions of thought. This is your direct connection to God. This is how God communicates to you. This is how God assists you. And your ability to follow Knowledge, to experience Knowledge and to express what Knowledge will give you to express to the world represents your service to God.</p>
<p>所有生命的创造者不受人类理解、人类制度或思想传统的束缚。这是你与上帝的直接联接。这是上帝与你沟通的方式。这是上帝协助你的方式。你遵循内识、体验内识并表达内识将赋予你向世界表达之物的能力，代表着你对上帝的服务。</p>
<p>Yet people’s awareness of Knowledge is so weak and fleeting, or even nonexistent, that they cannot give this great confidence. To give the individual this much power and this much authority over their life seems very threatening to governments and religious institutions and to people who feel that the individual must be controlled and restrained to a great degree.</p>
<p>然而人们对内识的觉知如此薄弱、转瞬即逝，甚至根本不存在，以至于他们无法赋予这种伟大的信心。赋予个体如此之大的权力和如此之大的权威来掌控他们的生命，对政府、宗教机构以及那些认为个体必须受到极大控制和约束的人们来说，似乎非常具有威胁性。</p>
<p>Yet regardless of these infringements, Knowledge lives within you. Because you yourself cannot overcome all the forces of persuasion in the mental environment, you need Knowledge to guide you and to be your primary reference point.</p>
<p>然而，无论这些侵犯如何，内识都活在你的内在。因为你自己无法克服心理环境中所有的说服力量，所以你需要内识来指引你，并成为你主要的参照点。</p>
<p>People may call this intuition, but intuition is really insufficient to describe what Knowledge is. Knowledge is intelligence. It is not just fleeting moments of insight. It is not just momentary experiences of premonition. People think of intuition as a kind of adjunct to their intellect and to their intellectual understanding, a kind of adjunct to their belief system. That is because they cannot tell what is weak from what is strong, what is wise from what is unwise.</p>
<p>人们或许称之为直觉，但直觉实际上不足以描述什么是内识。内识是智能的。它不仅仅是转瞬即逝的顿悟。它不仅仅是瞬间的预感体验。人们认为直觉是他们智力和理智理解的一种附属物，是他们信仰体系的一种附属物。那是因为他们无法分辨什么是软弱，什么是强大，什么是明智，什么是愚昧。</p>
<p>The intellect, to be really powerful, beneficial and effective, must serve a greater power. And this greater power is not a distant God or a government or an institution or some other powerful overbearing personality. The intellect is really meant to serve Knowledge.</p>
<p>智力若要真正强大、有益、有效，就必须服务于一种更伟大的力量。而这个更伟大的力量并非遥远的上帝、政府、机构或其他强大而专横的人物。智力的真正意义在于服务于内识。</p>
<p>In the true hierarchy of your Being, your body serves your mind, and your mind serves the Spirit, and the Spirit serves God. Here everything falls into place, and there is no discontinuity within you. You are not a bunch of sub-personalities or conflicting goals or contradicting intentions or motivations.</p>
<p>在你存在的真正层级结构中，你的身体服务于你的心灵，你的心灵服务于精神，精神服务于上帝。在这里，一切都井然有序，你内在没有不连续之处。你并非一堆子人格，也不是相互冲突的目标，也不是互相矛盾的意图或动机。</p>
<p>Here there is the power and the presence of Knowledge. And then there is the uniqueness of your personality with its strengths and weaknesses. And then, of course, there is all the social conditioning and tendencies that you have accumulated along the way, as if you were a traveler, traveling over land, and you have just accumulated a lot of dust and dirt and grime.</p>
<p>这里蕴含着内识的力量和存在。这里也蕴含着你人格的独特性，以及它的优势和劣势。当然，这里也蕴含着你一路积累的所有社会熏陶和倾向，就像你是一位旅行者，在陆地上旅行，你积累了大量的灰尘、污垢和尘垢。</p>
<p>This is kind of how it is in passing through the world. You accumulate a lot of the world’s thinking and prejudices. In most cases, you just adopt them from other people or from groups or institutions. And sometimes you make up your own versions, and you make your own decisions regarding them. But still you have acquired all this excess. Much of it has nothing to do with who you are or why you are in the world. But it is all very effective in conditioning your thinking and your outlook. To unburden yourself of these things, and even to evaluate them clearly, you must have the power and the presence of Knowledge as a reference point within yourself.</p>
<p>这有点像你在世间穿梭的情形。你积累了大量世俗的思维和偏见。大多数情况下，你只是从其他人、群体或机构那里吸收它们。有时你编造你自己的版本，并就此做出你自己的决定。但你仍然积累了所有这些过剩的东西。它们很多与你是谁或你为何身处世间无关。但它们却非常有效地制约着你的思维和你的观点。为了卸下这些东西的负担，甚至清晰地评估它们，你必须拥有内识的力量和存在，作为你内在的参照点。</p>
<p>People can be critical of their cultures. They can try to resist government manipulation. They can withdraw from society. They can become very distrustful. But they are still bound to those things that are influencing them.</p>
<p>人们可以批判他们的文化。他们可以试图抵制政府的操纵。他们可以脱离社会。他们可以变得非常不信任他人。但他们仍然会被那些影响他们的事物所束缚。</p>
<p>Here being a rebel is not a position of freedom. You are still being governed by the forces you are resisting. Perhaps you are resisting them, but they are still determining your thinking and your behavior. This holds true for many people. Yes, they are resisting certain forces in their government and culture, certain tendencies that they see are prevalent in other people, but they have not yet found the power of Knowledge to liberate their minds. They are held in bondage by the very forces that they resist and have difficulty thinking apart from this.</p>
<p>在这里，成为一个反叛者并非一种自由的立场。你依然被你所抵抗的力量所统领。或许你在抵抗它们，但它们依然在决定你的思维和你的行为。这对很多人来说都是如此。是的，他们在抵抗他们政府和文化中的某些力量，在他们看来在其他人身上盛行的某些倾向，但他们尚未找到内识的力量来解放他们的心灵。他们被他们所抵抗的力量所束缚，并且难以抛开这些去思考。</p>
<p>This is why to resist manipulation, you need the liberating power of Knowledge. You need this greater Intelligence, which is free, which is uncontaminated, which is not threatened by the world.</p>
<p>正因如此，为了抵制操控，你需要内识的解放力量。你需要这个更伟大的智能，它是自由的，它是未受污染的，它是不受世界威胁的。</p>
<p>You see, whether you are for or against a powerful influence, it still controls you and still dominates you. People do not understand this. They think resistance is freedom. But unless resistance gives you a kind of liberation, then you are bound. You are not free. You could spend your whole life resisting a government, or a political opposition, or certain other groups within your society, or certain tendencies within the human culture itself. But unless there is something within you that sets your life in a different direction, then you are not free. You are still bound by that which you resist. And around this resistance there will be ever-deepening hostility and resentment, judgment and condemnation. And all of these things attach you and chain you to that which you resist.</p>
<p>你看，无论你支持还是反对一个强大的影响力，它依然控制着你，依然支配着你。人们不理解这一点。他们认为抵抗就是自由。但除非抵抗能给你某种解放，否则你就会被束缚。你并不自由。你可以用一生去抵抗一个政府，或一个政治反对派，或你社会中的某些其他群体，或人类文化本身的某些倾向。但除非你内在有某种东西将你的生命引向不同的方向，否则你就并不自由。你依然会被你所抵抗的事物所束缚。围绕着这种抵抗，将会有越来越深的敌意和怨恨、评判和谴责。所有这些都会把你附着、束缚在你所抵抗的事物上。</p>
<p>All the while, your life was meant to be something else, to do something else, to give something else. But you cannot get there because you are bound by your resistance and your hostility and condemnation. This is the case for many people, of course, and affects the general population as a whole. The energy that you take in resisting something or criticizing something or being opposed to something can be very all consuming—coloring your perception, limiting your thinking, shutting down your creativity, dominating your life.</p>
<p>一直以来，你的生命本应是另一种样子，做一些别的事情，付出一些别的东西。但是，你却无法做到这一点，因为你被你的抗拒、敌意和谴责所束缚。当然，很多人都是这种情况，而且影响着整个社会。你用来抗拒、批评或反对某事的能量，可能会非常耗费你的精力——它会玷污你的感知，限制你的思维，扼杀你的创造力，主宰你的生命。</p>
<p>Unless it is your mission to change governments or institutions, this becomes a great misfortune. You have not found your freedom to follow a deeper power within yourself. Here your freedom cannot be just from something—freedom from conventional thinking, freedom from certain political persuasions, freedom from certain kinds of human behavior. You need your freedom for something. Freedom from things is perhaps the emphasis at the outset, but really beyond this, freedom is for something.</p>
<p>除非你的使命是改变政府或机构，否则这会成为一种巨大的不幸。你还没有找到你的自由，去追随你内在的一种更深层次的力量。在这里，你的自由不仅仅是摆脱某种东西——摆脱传统思维的自由，摆脱某些政治信仰的自由，摆脱某些人类行为的自由。你需要你的自由来做某事。摆脱某种事物的自由或许是一开始的重点，但真正超越这一点，自由是为了某种东西。</p>
<p>Ultimately, only Knowledge within you knows what this freedom is for. This is why so many people do not know what to do with their freedom. It just becomes wasted in self-destructive behavior or opposition to others because they do not know what their freedom is for. They cannot figure this out with their intellect. And their social conditioning closes the door or prevents them from discovering what they are really here to do and what they are really here to serve.</p>
<p>最终，只有你内在的内识知道这种自由的意义。正因如此，如此多的人不知道该如何运用他们的自由。它只是被浪费在自我毁灭的行为或与他人的对抗之中，因为他们不知道他们的自由的意义。他们无法用他们的智力去理解这一点。他们的社会熏陶关闭了大门，或阻止了他们发现他们真正在此做什么，以及他们真正在此服务什么。</p>
<p>Of course, this breeds immense unhappiness, disappointment and frustration because the great need of the soul is not being met. If you are not really doing what you came to the world to do, if you are not really discovering the power that lives within you, if you are not really finding your freedom in the mental environment to discover and express your greater purpose here, then you are suffering. Rich or poor you are suffering.</p>
<p>当然，这滋生了极大的不快乐、失望和挫折，因为灵魂的伟大需求没有得到满足。如果你没有真正去做你来到这个世界要做的事情，如果你没有真正发现你内在的力量，如果你没有真正在心理环境中找到你的自由，去发现和表达你在此的更伟大目的，那么你就在受苦。无论贫富，你都在受苦。</p>
<p>You can suffer in splendor. You can suffer in wealth. You are driven. You are uncomfortable. You cannot sit still for five minutes. You are overtaken with your desires and your fears, your issues and your problems. Even if you have great affluence and do not need to face the difficulties of trying to survive in the world, you can still be completely dominated by all this.</p>
<p>你可能在辉煌中受苦，也可能在富裕中受苦。你被驱使，你感到不安。你一刻也静不下来。你的欲望、你的恐惧、你的问题和你的烦恼充斥着你的内心。即使你拥有巨大的财富，无需面对在世间生存的艰辛，你仍然可能被这一切彻底掌控。</p>
<p>Therefore, to be free of manipulation, you must find that part of you that is free of manipulation.</p>
<p>因此，为了摆脱操纵，你必须找到你不受操纵的那部分。</p>
<p>You live at the surface of the mind. Like the surface of the ocean, it is made turbulent by the winds of the world and by external forces. But deep down in the ocean, there are currents that are moving the waters of the world all over the Earth. They are not affected by the daily weather.</p>
<p>你活在心灵的表面。如同海洋表面，它因世间的风和外力而波涛汹涌。但在海洋深处，有洋流将世界各地的海水推向地球。它们不受日常天气的影响。</p>
<p>There is a deeper current in your life that is not affected by daily events. It is this deeper current you must experience. It is there, but it is beneath the surface. From time to time, you have little reminders that there is a deeper current. You have a moment of intuition, or you have a lucid moment where you experience yourself outside of time and space. But these experiences are so rare and fleeting so as to have little impact upon your thinking and behavior in life.</p>
<p>你的生命中有一股更深层次的潮流，它不受日常事件的影响。你必须体验这股更深层次的潮流。它就在那里，但它潜藏在表面之下。时不时地，你会有一些细微的提醒，提醒你有一股更深层次的潮流。你会有片刻的直觉，或者你会有片刻的清醒，体验到你自己超越时间和空间。但这些体验如此罕见且转瞬即逝，以至于对你生命中的思维和行为几乎不会产生影响。</p>
<p>This issue of manipulation now is very central to your own experience of yourself and your ability to think freely and clearly. When you listen to people’s thoughts, you realize they are not the author of these thoughts. They are just the general thoughts of their group or their associations. That is why everyone says the same things, depending upon their group and associations. There is very little original thought here. There is very little clear thinking. People are just mimicking each other to belong to whatever group or association they identify with.</p>
<p>现在，操纵的问题对于你自身的体验以及你自由清晰思考的能力至关重要。当你倾听他人的想法时，你会意识到他们并非这些想法的作者。这些想法只是他们所属群体或社团的泛泛之谈。正因如此，每个人都会说同样的话，这取决于他们所属的群体和社团。这里几乎没有原创的思想。几乎没有清晰的思维。人们只是在互相模仿，以融入他们所认同的群体或社团。</p>
<p>When someone thinks creatively, dynamically, well they are considered a genius. If their thoughts are acceptable to society, they can be accorded great respect. They can innovate. They can think differently. They can be creative. They can innovate. But really it is because everyone else is so slavish in their thinking and so dominated by the mental environment that these individuals stand out.</p>
<p>当一个人思维富有创造力、充满活力时，他们就会被视为天才。如果他们的思想被社会接受，他们就会受到极大的尊重。他们可以创新。他们可以与众不同地思考。他们可以富有创造力。他们可以创新。但实际上，正是因为其他人的思维都过于奴性，过于受心理环境的支配，这些人才脱颖而出。</p>
<p>It is a great loss to the human family that so few of its members can think creatively and dynamically in this way. This represents part of the great impedance that is holding humanity back, holding it back from advancing in every respect.</p>
<p>人类大家庭中如此少的成员能够如此创造性地、充满活力地思考，这是一种巨大的损失。这代表着阻碍人类前进、阻碍其在各方面进步的巨大障碍的一部分。</p>
<p>People may appear to walk about freely, but when seen from a position of Knowledge, everyone looks like they are in chains, as if they are gangs of slaves or gangs of convicts trudging around—oppressed, overwhelmed, dominated by their environment, dominated by their feelings, dominated by their group associations, performing for one another, trying to be accepted.</p>
<p>人们或许看上去自由自在地走来走去，但从内识的角度看，每个人都像是戴着锁链，仿佛他们是一帮奴隶或一帮囚犯四处跋涉——被压迫，被压垮，被他们的环境支配，被他们的感受支配，被他们的团体关联支配，为彼此表演，试图被接受。</p>
<p>When you begin to gain your own freedom here, you will look at others and it will be shocking. People are not free to think. They cannot feel what they feel. They cannot know what they know. They are afraid to look at great problems. They feel so inadequate that they just avoid anything that challenges their thinking or that requires great attention and consideration.</p>
<p>当你在此开始获得你自己的自由时，你将审视他人，而这将令人震惊。人们无法自由思考。他们无法感受他们所感受的。他们无法知晓他们所知道的。他们害怕直视重大问题。他们感到如此无能，以至于他们只是回避任何挑战他们思维或需要巨大关注和深思的事物。</p>
<p>They just want to be safe. They just want to belong. They just want to be focused on their little endeavors. They do not want to be bothered with the great problems of the world. They do not want to pay attention to their environment and to changing circumstances. And then when circumstances work against them, they feel like victims. They complain bitterly. They are outraged. This becomes so clear when you can see clearly.</p>
<p>他们只想要安全。他们只想要归属感。他们只想要专注于他们的小事业。他们不想被世间的大问题所困扰。他们不想关注他们的环境和不断变化的境况。而当情况对他们不利时，他们就会觉得他们是受害者。他们痛苦地抱怨。他们义愤填膺。当你看清这一点时，这一点就变得如此清晰。</p>
<p>It is a great tragedy for the human family that even with its affluence and the degree of freedom that most of humanity has been able to achieve at great expense, people do not take advantage of their freedom. They do not know what to do with their freedom. The wealthy squander it on addictions and ambitions and personal indulgences. It is a great tragedy for the human family.</p>
<p>人类大家庭的一大悲剧在于，即使拥有富裕的生活，以及大多数人付出巨大代价才获得的一定程度的自由，人们却不去使用他们的自由。他们不知道该如何使用他们的自由。富人把自由挥霍在瘾癖、野心和个人放纵上。这是人类大家庭的一大悲剧。</p>
<p>But for you, it is time to find the power and the presence of Knowledge and to come to terms with the fact that your mind, thinking and feelings are in fact being dominated by so many different forces in the mental environment.</p>
<p>但对你来说，现在是时候去发现内识的力量和存在，​​并接受这样一个事实：你的心灵、思维和感觉实际上被心理环境中的许多不同力量所支配。</p>
<p>And now humanity is facing competition from beyond the world. Various groups from the universe are in the world today to try to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity. They will not use force to achieve their goals because they are more intelligent. They will use the powers of persuasion and intimidation to gain advantage here.</p>
<p>如今，人类正面临来自世界之外的竞争。现在，来自宇宙的各种团体在世界上试图利用虚弱而分裂的人类。他们不会使用武力来实现他们的目标，因为他们更聪慧。他们会利用说服和恐吓的力量来获得优势。</p>
<p>Strange craft have been flying in your skies increasingly over the last half century. Witnesses have been seeing these craft, encounters have been made, and people have been taken against their will by these forces. Their power is power in the mental environment—the power to persuade, the power to recondition people’s thinking and beliefs, the power to shape people’s perception. Humanity has very little skill in the mental environment, and so these persuasions can be cast upon people with great ease and little difficulty.</p>
<p>在过去的半个世纪里，奇异的飞行器在你们的天空中飞行的次数越来越多。目击者目睹了这些飞行器，遭遇了它们，人们被这些势力强行带走。它们的力量是心理环境的力量——说服的力量，重塑人们思维和信念的力量，塑造人们感知的力量。人类在心理环境中的技巧非常匮乏，因此这些说服可以轻而易举地、毫不费力地施加于人。</p>
<p>Some people even welcome this Intervention thinking that it represents a great spiritual liberation. They want what the Intervention has to offer: the promises of freedom, high technology and so forth. But it is all a deception being placed upon an ignorant and unsuspecting humanity.</p>
<p>有些人甚至欢迎这种干预，认为它代表着一种伟大的精神解放。他们想要干预所能提供的一切：自由的承诺、高科技等等。但这一切都是对无知和毫无戒备的人类的欺骗。</p>
<p>Now you are dealing with a more powerful force in the mental environment. For these races have to compete with other races, and have had to develop great skill and discernment and great skill in manipulating the thoughts, the attitudes and expectations of others. This represents their primary strength. And this they will bring to bear on an unsuspecting humanity.</p>
<p>现在你们正在应对心理环境中的一个更强大势力。因为这些种族必须与其他种族竞争，并且必须发展出强大的技能和辨识力，以及操控他人思想、态度和期望的强大技能。这代表着他们的主要力量。他们将把这施加于毫无戒备的人类。</p>
<p>While everyone goes about their daily life, this Greater Darkness is in the world. You will have to face this because in the universe around you, the power of skill in the mental environment represents the greatest way that stable societies can influence each other and determine each other’s activities.</p>
<p>当每个人继续日常生活时，这股更大的黑暗就笼罩着世界。你必须面对它，因为在你们周围的宇宙中，心理环境中的技能力量代表着稳定的社会能够相互影响、决定彼此活动的最重要方式。</p>
<p>Humanity is still brutish. It still thinks the use of force is the great way to achieve your goals. But in the universe amongst much older societies, the use of force is seen as mutually destructive and is avoided and suppressed. Other ways are found to gain information from others, and to control others, and to protect yourself from their scrutiny as well.</p>
<p>人类依然野蛮。它依然认为使用武力是实现目标的最佳途径。但在宇宙中，在更古老的社会中，使用武力被视为相互毁灭，因此被避免和压制。人们找到了其他方式来获取他人的信息，控制他人，以及保护自己免受他人的审视。</p>
<p>This represents a new threshold of learning for humanity. But again, what will free you even from these forms of manipulation and persuasion is the same power of Knowledge that lives within you every moment.</p>
<p>这代表着人类学习的全新门槛。但同样，能够将你们从这些操纵和说服形式中解放出来的，是那无时无刻存在于你们内在的内识之力。</p>
<p>For nothing in the universe can overtake Knowledge. Your intellect can be overtaken. Your feelings can be overtaken. Your attitudes can be directed. Your thoughts can be conditioned. Your feelings can be aroused and manipulated. But Knowledge within you is beyond persuasion and manipulation. And this is why it represents the greatest source of strength and freedom for you and for everyone.</p>
<p>因为宇宙中没有任何事物能够超越内识。你的智力可以被超越。你的感受可以被超越。你的态度可以被引导。你的思想可以被制约。你的感受可以被激发和操控。但你内在的内识超越说服和操控。正因如此，它代表着你以及每个人最伟大的力量和自由源泉。</p>
<p>Knowledge represents your deeper conscience. It is ethical. It has a moral foundation. Regardless of what your culture has tried to condition you to think or believe, you know when you are doing something wrong. You know if you are hurting other people, it is wrong. And you know when you can honestly connect with someone and have an experience of real communication, it produces a deep and abiding feeling of well-being in you. This is not the result of culture and cultural imprinting. This represents a deeper conscience.</p>
<p>内识代表着你更深层次的良知。它合乎伦理，拥有道德基础。无论你的文化试图将你塑造成怎样的思维或信仰，你都知道你何时做错了。你知道，如果你伤害了他人，那就是错的。你知道，当你能够真诚地与他人连接，并体验真正的沟通时，它会在你内心产生一种深刻而持久的幸福感。这并非文化或文化烙印的产物。这代表着一种更深层次的良知。</p>
<p>Yet people can lose their connection with this by having their minds overtaken by their societies and their families, their religions and the influence of others. But this deeper conscience still lives within them. Even if they have lost sight of it, even if they violate it, even if they carry out terrible acts in the world, there is still this deeper foundation. They have just lost contact with it.</p>
<p>然而人们可能会因为他们的心灵被他们的社会、他们的家庭、他们的宗教以及他人的影响所占据而失去与此的联结。但这种更深层次的良知依然活在他们内在。即使他们已经看不见它，即使他们违背它，即使他们在世界上犯下可怕的罪行，这种更深层次的基础依然存在。他们只是失去了与它的联系。</p>
<p>It is hard to persuade a slave that they are actually free. They will point to their circumstances, but they are still actually free. It is therefore challenging to persuade people or to educate people who are slavish in their thinking and beliefs to realize they really have a source of freedom within themselves. They will point to their circumstances as a justification for their feelings, but really, the freedom still lives within them.</p>
<p>很难说服奴隶相信他们实际上是自由的。他们会指出他们的处境，但实际上他们仍然是自由的。因此，说服或教育那些在思维和信仰上受奴役的人认识到他们内心深处真正拥有自由的源泉，是极具挑战性的。他们会指出他们的处境来为他们的感受辩解，但实际上，自由仍然存在于他们的内心。</p>
<p>Humanity is now facing Great Waves of change in the world: environmental destruction, diminishing resources, violent weather, economic and political instability and the risk of war. And on top of this, humanity is facing a clever and hidden Intervention into the world. The challenge to human freedom by all these things is so immense. And it casts great doubt over humanity’s future and well-being, and humanity’s sovereignty as a free race within this world.</p>
<p>人类如今正面临世界巨变的浪潮：环境破坏、资源枯竭、恶劣天气、经济和政治动荡以及战争风险。除此之外，人类还面临着一种巧妙而隐蔽的干预。所有这些对人类自由的挑战是如此巨大。它对人类的未来和福祉，以及人类作为这个世界上一个自由种族的主权，投下了巨大的疑虑。</p>
<p>Therefore, the Teaching in The Way of Knowledge is fundamental in so many ways. Freedom is now being jeopardized as never before by powerful forces, both within the world and beyond the world. Humanity is now facing competition from certain races in the universe, races of physical beings who are motivated by the same things that motivate you. Human culture and growing instability in the world around you will threaten the fabric of human civilization, the stability of human civilization and the well-being of countless people all around the world.</p>
<p>因此，内识之路的教导在很多方面都至关重要。自由如今正受到前所未有的威胁，这些威胁来自世界内部和外部的强大势力。人类如今正面临来自宇宙中某些种族的竞争，这些物质存在的种族与你们有着同样的动机。人类文化以及你们周遭世界日益增长的不稳定性，将威胁人类文明的结构、人类文明的稳定以及全世界无数民众的福祉。</p>
<p>Your quest for truth and peace and your quest for freedom must be based upon a deeper Knowledge within you if it is to be real, if it is to be effective, if it is to really free you from the dominance of the world around you.</p>
<p>你对真理与和平的追求以及你对自由的追求必须基于你内在更深层次的内识，如果它要真实，如果它要有效，如果它要真正将你从周围世界的支配中解放出来。</p>
<p>This is not to take you out of the world or to have you transcend the world, but to give you the strength and the power and the wisdom to be able to contribute in the world according to the greater purpose that has brought you here. But first you must have the freedom to experience and to find this purpose; and to reorient your life towards this purpose; and to free yourself from those obligations, those commitments and those beliefs that keep you in chains here, that bind you to the past, that keep you from realizing the guiding power of Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>这并不是要带你离开世界，或让你超越世界，而是要赋予你力量、能力和智慧，使你能够按照带你来到这里的更伟大目的，在世界上做出贡献。但首先你必须拥有自由去体验和发现这个目的；并重新调整你的生命朝向这个目的；并让你自己摆脱那些让你在这里被束缚、把你束缚在过去、阻止你认知你内在内识指引力量的义务、承诺和信仰。</p>
<p>God has sent a New Message into the world to prepare humanity for the Great Waves of change, to prepare humanity for the realities of life in the universe, to teach about spirituality at the level of Knowledge, and to reveal to humanity its future and its destiny and the great decisions it must make and the great need for human cooperation.</p>
<p>上帝向世界发来了一条新讯息，让人类为变革的巨浪进行准备，让人类为宇宙生命的现实进行准备，在内识的层面上教授精神性，并向人类揭示它的未来和它的天命，以及它必须做出的伟大决策和对人类合作的伟大需求。</p>
<p>This rests upon the power of Knowledge within the individual, the liberating power of Knowledge. Humanity’s well-being at any moment is a balance between people’s awareness of Knowledge and their own social conditioning. What prevents people from violence and degradation and cruelty is the power and presence of Knowledge within themselves.</p>
<p>这依赖于个体内在内识的力量，内识的解放力量。人类在任何时刻的福祉，都取决于人们对内识的觉知与其自身社会制约之间的平衡。阻止人们走向暴力、堕落和残忍的，正是内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>In the future, there will be greater instability in your cultures and economies. What will keep people from preying upon one another, from attacking one another, from social violence and disorder? It will be the power and the presence of Knowledge. And what will give you the freedom to feel secure in an insecure world, and to find your direction while people all around you are in confusion and chaos? It is the power and the presence of Knowledge.</p>
<p>未来，你们的文化和经济将更加不稳定。什么将阻止人们彼此掠夺，彼此攻击，以及社会暴力和混乱？它是内识的力量和存在。什么将赋予你自由，让你在一个不安全的世界中感到安全，并在你周围的人们陷入困惑和混乱时找到你的方向？它是内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>That is why God’s New Message has provided the preparation in The Way of Knowledge that people everywhere around the world can use, even today—by taking the Steps to Knowledge, by reconnecting with their deeper foundation, by being able to have their eyes and ears and senses liberated from the dominance of persuasion and manipulation in the mental environment.</p>
<p>正因为如此，上帝的新讯息在内识之路中提供了世界各地的人们即使在今天也能使用的准备——通过开展内识进阶，通过重新联接他们更深层次的基础，通过能够让他们的眼睛、耳朵和感官从心理环境中说服和操纵的支配中解放出来。</p>
<p>This is the key to your freedom and your fulfillment in the world and your ability to serve a world in need rather than merely condemning it. This represents the source of your satisfaction and fulfillment and will give you the eyes to see and the senses to report the presence of those relationships that you are destined to meet, that are part of your greater purpose in life.</p>
<p>这是通往你在世界上的自由和成就的关键，也是你服务于一个有需要的世界而非仅仅谴责它的能力的关键。这代表着你满足和成就的源泉，并将赋予你眼睛去看，赋予你感官去报告那些你注定要遇见的关系的存在，它们是你生命中更伟大目的的组成部分。</p>
<p>God has given you the perfect antidote to evil and the perfect answer to your needs. But you must experience this, and build a connection to this, and yield to this power, and allow it to free your mind and your perception. This is the greatest gift to you, and this will be your greatest gift to others who like you are seeking to find their freedom and their purpose and their true activities and destiny in the world.</p>
<p>上帝已经赋予你对抗邪恶的完美解药，以及满足你需求的完美答案。但你必须体验它，构建与它的连接，臣服于这种力量，并让它解放你的心灵和你的感知。这是赐予你的最伟大礼物，这也将是你给予其他像你一样正在寻求他们的自由、他们的目的、他们在世上真正的活动和天命的人最伟大的礼物。</p>
