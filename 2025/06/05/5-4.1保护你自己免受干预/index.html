<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on March 17, 2011 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2011 年 3 月 17 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As humanity faces its greatest difficulties living in a declining world, certain other races from the universe around you will come to try to take advantage of the situation for themselves. Posing as enlightened beings who have your best interests at heart, they will seek to gain greater influence here in a world of great value and strategic importance.</p>
<p>当人类在这个衰落的世界里面临最大的困境时，来自你们周围宇宙的某些其他种族会试图利用这一局面为他们自己谋利。他们伪装成开明的存在，真心为你们着想，试图在这个具有重大价值和战略意义的世界中获取更大的影响力。</p>
<p>Humanity’s difficulties and overuse of the world have prompted this Intervention. It is an Intervention with a dangerous intention. Many people have been affected by it, and some have been taken against their will aboard craft, alien craft. It is a phenomenon that has only recently been discovered and researched.</p>
<p>人类的困境和对世界的过度使用促成了这次干预。这是一次意图危险的干预。许多人受到了影响，有些人甚至被强行带上飞船——外星飞船。这一现象最近才被发现和研究。</p>
<p>It is a worldwide phenomenon. It is being done to breed a new leadership for humanity for the future. Should the Intervention prove to be successful, individuals will be in place, appearing to be humankind, but dedicated and connected to the Intervention itself.</p>
<p>它是一个全球现象。它是为了培育人类未来的新领导力。如果干预被证明成功，个体将会到位，他们看起来像人类，但却致力于并与干预本身相连。</p>
<p>Others are taken to be reconditioned, to be turned to support the Intervention and its plans and goals for humanity. It is one of the great dangers facing the human family at this time, a great danger that very few people in the world are even aware of.</p>
<p>其他人则被带去重新改造，被用来支持干预及其针对人类的计划和目标。这是人类大家庭此刻面临的巨大危险之一，一个世界上极少数人甚至从未察觉到的巨大危险。</p>
<p>The Intervention has been functioning here with little human resistance for many decades. Its plans are now in a mature phase, waiting to exploit human weakness, human division, human superstition and human expectation to their own advantage, to gain control of the world and the world’s precious resources.</p>
<p>干预数十年来一直在此运作，几乎没有人类抵抗。它的计划如今已进入成熟阶段，正等待着利用人类的弱点、人类的分裂、人类的迷信和人类的期望来谋取私利，从而控制世界以及世界宝贵的资源。</p>
<p>Their goal is not to eliminate humanity, but to use humanity as a workforce, as a subservient workforce, to maintain the appearance of normalcy as long as possible while the power and authority over the world is shifted to foreign powers. It is a complex and devious plan.</p>
<p>他们的目标并非消灭人类，而是利用人类作为劳动力，作为顺从的劳动力，尽可能长时间地维持正常的表象，同时将世界的权力和权威转移到外来大国手中。这是一个复杂而狡猾的计划。</p>
<p>Its reality and its demonstration in the world are revealed through God’s New Revelation, a New Message for humanity, as part of the preparation for the Greater Community, a Greater Community of intelligent life in the universe.</p>
<p>它的现实性及其在世界上的展现，通过上帝的新启示——一条致人类的新讯息——被揭示出来，作为对大社区——一个宇宙智能生命大社区——的准备的一部分。</p>
<p>Humanity is unaware and unprepared for this great threshold—indeed, the greatest threshold that humanity has ever faced and one that will determine the fate and the future of the human family. It is of such great significance that governments of the world hide what they know and discourage their populations from inquiring about this most serious problem.</p>
<p>人类尚未觉察、尚未准备迎接这个伟大门槛——事实上，这是人类迄今面临的最大门槛，它将决定人类大家庭的命运和未来。它意义重大，以至于世界各国政府隐瞒他们所知，并阻止其民众探究这个最严重的问题。</p>
<p>In spite of the secrecy and the denial, people around the world have witnessed foreign craft flying in your skies with impunity. Many people have been taken against their will. And others have been influenced to believe and to accept the Intervention and to become part of its persuasion upon humanity.</p>
<p>尽管存在秘密和否认，世界各地的人们目睹了外国飞行器在你们的天空中肆无忌惮地飞行。许多人被强行带走。其他人则受到影响，相信并接受干预，并成为其对人类劝说的一部分。</p>
<p>The question arises: “How can I protect myself from the Intervention?” This, of course, depends upon your previous exposure. To what extent have you had contact and exposure to the Intervention and its presence in the world?</p>
<p>问题出现了：“我如何保护我自己免受干预？”这当然取决于你之前的接触。你在多大程度上接触并暴露了干预及其在世界上的存在？</p>
<p>God’s New Revelation is here to provide the preparation and the means of protection, but there are certain things that people must know at the outset regardless of the degree of their exposure.</p>
<p>上帝的新启示旨在提供准备和保护方法，但无论人们接触的程度如何，他们一开始就必须知道某些事情。</p>
<p>The first is to become aware of the Intervention and to not be deceived by its promises of peace and salvation for humanity. Here you must not be dazzled by advanced technology. And you must not lose faith in the human family, human institutions and human leadership, for the Intervention will seek to exploit this to their own advantage. Having lost faith in human leadership and human institutions, people will naturally turn to other powers to guide them, to protect them and, so they believe, to redeem and to restore the world.</p>
<p>首先是要察觉干预，不要被它对人类和平与救赎的承诺所欺骗。在这里，你绝不能被先进科技所迷惑。你绝不能对人类大家庭、人类机构和人类领导力失去信心，因为干预将寻求利用这些来谋取自身利益。在失去了对人类领导力和人类机构的信心后，人们自然会转向其他大国来指引他们、保护他们，并——正如他们所相信的那样——来救赎和重建世界。</p>
<p>It is a perfect scenario for a devious set of forces here in the world today. They do not come with military power, for that is not their strength. Who they are in the Greater Community is something that the New Message reveals and that you are encouraged to study.</p>
<p>这对于当今世界上一群邪恶势力来说，是一个完美的场景。他们没有军事力量，因为那不是他们的强项。他们在大社区里是谁，是新讯息所揭示的，并鼓励你去研究。</p>
<p>God has called upon those few free races in your region of space to witness the Intervention and to send their testimony and their Briefings to help prepare humanity. This has been done in a series of Briefings called The Allies of Humanity Briefings. For it is important for you to know that you have those in your region of space who care about human freedom and sovereignty in this world, or you will feel overwhelmed and too diminished to have confidence in humanity’s future and freedom in the universe.</p>
<p>上帝召唤你们太空区域内少数自由种族来见证干预，并发送他们的见证和简报，以帮助人类进行准备。这已在名为“人类盟友的简报”的一系列简报中完成。因为重要的是，你要知道，在你们的太空区域内，有一些种族关心人类在这个世界上的自由和主权，否则你将感到不堪重负，过于渺小，以至于对人类的未来和宇宙中的自由失去信心。</p>
<p>But those races who are free will not intervene in the world, for they understand this is a violation of humanity’s authority and sovereignty in this world. Their assistance will be given in the form of a set of Briefings to alert you to the presence of the Intervention and what must be done to counteract its presence in the world. So the first step in your personal preparation is to become aware of the Intervention as it really is, not as it pretends to be.</p>
<p>但是那些自由种族不会干预世界，因为他们理解这是对人类在这个世界上的权威和主权的侵犯。他们的援助将以一系列简报的形式提供，以警示你们干预的存在，以及必须做什么来对抗它在世界上的存在。因此，你个人准备的第一步，是去察觉干预的真面目，而非它伪装的样子。</p>
<p>Next, you must not lose faith in humanity—in its creativity, in its power and in its integrity, despite the grave and serious errors that are committed in the world and which will be committed into the future as you face a declining world.</p>
<p>其次，你绝不能对人类失去信心——对人类的创造力，对人类的力量和对人类完整性的信心，尽管世界上正在犯下严重错误，并且当你面对一个衰落的世界时，这些错误还将继续犯下去。</p>
<p>You must not lose confidence in your own inner power and strength that God has given you to be able to face and to navigate the difficult and uncertain times to come. Without this faith and this growing confidence based upon your real experience, your awareness of the Greater Community and of the Intervention in the world will be too overwhelming for you. You will not have a strong enough foundation upon which to stand, and your awareness will defeat you and overwhelm you.</p>
<p>你绝不能失去对你自身内在力量和实力的信心，上帝赋予了你这种力量和实力，使你能够面对和驾驭即将到来的艰难和不确定的时代。如果没有这种信念和这种基于你真实体验而不断增长的信心，你对大社区以及对世界上的干预的觉知将对你来说过于难以承受。你将没有一个足够强大的基础来立足，你的觉知将击败你、淹没你。</p>
<p>That is why the Creator of all life is sending the New Revelation to the world and with it the preparation to gain access to the greater power of Knowledge within you—a deeper Mind, a greater Mind within you, the part of you that is still connected to God.</p>
<p>正因为如此，所有生命的创造者正在向世界发送新的启示，并随之进行准备，以触及你内在内识的更伟大力量——一个更深层次的心灵，一种你内在的更伟大心灵，你依然与上帝联接的那个部分。</p>
<p>Regardless of your religious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs, this is true for every person. And it is true for you. You must have this greater power and strength available and take the Steps to Knowledge as they are being provided through the New Revelation.</p>
<p>无论你是否有宗教信仰，这对每个人来说都是真实的。对你来说也是如此。你必须拥有这种更伟大的力量和实力，并开展通过新启示提供的内识进阶。</p>
<p>What We are saying here is that you must build a foundation within yourself where your greater strengths can issue forth and begin to guide you in your daily life and that you have increasing experiences that the power and presence of Knowledge live within you and will guide you when it is truly needed.</p>
<p>我们在此所说的是，你必须在你自己内在构建一个基础，在那里你的更伟大力量能够释放并开始指导你的日常生活，并且你越来越多地体验到内识的力量和存在生活在你的内在，并在真正需要的时候指导你。</p>
<p>You cannot use this power to gain wealth and advantage. It is not a resource for your intellect. It is far too important and too great for that. Likewise, you cannot comprehend it intellectually because the power of Knowledge and the reality of Knowledge exist beyond the realm and the reach of your intellect. It speaks of your deeper nature and your greater purpose for being in the world at this time, which must be revealed to you slowly and incrementally as you develop and as you take the Steps to Knowledge.</p>
<p>你无法使用这种力量来获得财富和优势。它并非你智力的资源。它太过重要、太过伟大了。同样，你也无法从智力上理解它，因为内识的力量和内识的现实超越了你智力的领域和范围。它讲述着你更深层次的自然以及你此刻身处世界的更伟大目的，这些必须随着你的发展，随着你开展内识进阶，缓慢地、渐进地向你揭示。</p>
<p>If you are to have a Greater Community awareness and understanding, if you are to comprehend the greater forces that are moving the world and the fact that humanity is facing competition now from beyond the world, you must have this greater strength. You must be building it every day, for it is this greater strength that will give you immunity from the influences of the Greater Community. It will enable you to see clearly beyond the powers of persuasion and deception that are being cast upon the human family, particularly on an individual basis.</p>
<p>如果你要拥有一种大社区觉知和理解，如果你要理解正在推动世界的更大驱动力，以及人类现在正面临来自世界之外的竞争的事实，你就必须拥有这种更伟大力量。你必须每天构建它，因为正是这种更伟大力量将赋予你免受大社区影响的免疫力。它将使你能够清晰地看透那些正在施加于人类大家庭，尤其是在个人层面上的说服和欺骗的力量。</p>
<p>As the human condition deteriorates and there is greater uncertainty, conflict and upheaval in the world, people will turn to other powers in the universe, dazzled by advanced technology and the appearance of those who proclaim themselves to be here to save the human family. You must see beyond this deception, and you must warn others, for it is a great problem that is going unheeded, and people are unprepared. They do not know what to make of this.</p>
<p>随着人类状况的恶化，以及世界上更大的不确定性、冲突和动荡，人们将转向宇宙中的其他大国，被先进的科技以及那些自称在此拯救人类家庭之人的出现所迷惑。你必须看透这种欺骗，你必须警告他人，因为这是一个被忽视的重大问题，人们没有做好准备。他们不知道该如何应对。</p>
<p>Your awareness and your education here are critically important, or you will not have the strength to resist the Intervention. You will not have the power and the clarity to be of service to humanity, to warn humanity about the dangers of this Intervention and what it truly seeks to establish here on Earth.</p>
<p>你在此的觉知和教育至关重要，否则你将没有力量抵抗干预。你将没有力量和清晰性去服务人类，去警示人类这一干预的危险以及它真正寻求在地球上建立什么。</p>
<p>Only God can provide this education for you, and God has called those few free races in the universe to supplement this education so that you may have a very clear understanding of what you are dealing with. But you must understand that competition is part of nature and that intervention is something that has happened throughout human history, with one group of people intervening in another group’s environment. The lessons of intervention are clear, but people are unaware of these things. Unless they have experienced them directly in their own nation’s recent history, the notion of intervention can seem very foreign.</p>
<p>只有上帝才能为你提供这种教育，上帝也召唤了宇宙中少数自由种族来补充这种教育，以便你能够非常清晰地理解你正在面对的一切。但你必须理解，竞争是自然的一部分，干预是贯穿人类历史的常态，一群人干预另一群人的环境。干预的教训显而易见，但人们却并未察觉到这些。除非他们在他们自身国家的近代史中亲身经历过，否则干预的概念可能会显得非常陌生。</p>
<p>In dealing with the presence of the Intervention, should you experience it in any way, it is so important that you not become emotional. Do not become loving. Do not become fearful. Be neutral. And if it is directed at you specifically, tell it that you recognize its deception and that you will not support it. Make yourself an undesirable subject for their usage. Tell them you will resist them with every fiber of your being and they will not choose you to become part of their human group of representatives. You will cease to be a desirable subject for their study or experimentation.</p>
<p>在应对干预的存在时，如果你以任何方式体验到它，至关重要的是不要变得情绪化。不要变得充满爱。不要变得恐惧。保持中立。如果它是专门针对你的，告诉它你认识到它的欺骗，并且你不会支持它。让你自己成为一个不受欢迎的对象，供他们利用。告诉他们，你将用你存在的每一根纤维抵抗他们，他们不会选择你成为他们人类代表群体的一部分。你将不再是他们研究或实验的理想对象。</p>
<p>At this moment, you have no idea how cruel their treatment of human beings really is. They have no regard for your spirituality or the value of your presence. You are merely a tool and a resource to them. Individual freedom is unknown to them, and they do not value it. They think it is part of the chaotic nature of humanity, a chaotic nature that they seek to control and to eliminate.</p>
<p>此时此刻，你根本不知道他们对待人类的方式究竟有多么残酷。他们根本不尊重你们的精神性，也不重视你们存在的价值。你们对他们来说只不过是一个工具和资源。他们不知道个人自由，也不重视它。他们认为这是人类混乱自然的一部分，是他们试图控制和消灭的混乱自然。</p>
<p>If you have had previous encounters, it is important that you seek assistance in uncovering them so they are not lurking within you, influencing you, casting shadows over your mind.</p>
<p>如果你以前有过这样的遭遇，那么重要的是你要寻求帮助来发现它们，这样它们就不会潜伏在你的内在，影响你，给你的心灵蒙上阴影。</p>
<p>If you have had a direct encounter, it means that you have been influenced and discouraged from recalling your experiences and understanding them clearly and honestly. You have been compromised if this has occurred. You have been violated. Your mind has been breached, and an attempt has been made to alter your understanding and your awareness.</p>
<p>如果你有过直接的遭遇，这意味着你受到了影响，无法回忆起你的经历，也无法清晰诚实地理解它们。如果发生这种情况，你就受到了损害。你受到了侵犯。你的心灵被攻破，有人试图改变你的理解和觉知。</p>
<p>There are many people who suspect or who are certain that this has happened to them. If they are clear thinking and honest with themselves, they will realize that it is a violation and that it is not being carried out for a good purpose in any way.</p>
<p>许多人怀疑或确信自己遭遇了这种事。如果他们思维清晰，诚实面对他们自己，就会意识到这是一种违规行为，而且这种行为无论如何都不是出于好意。</p>
<p>Some people have been turned to the point where it would be very difficult for them to see clearly and to gain access to the power of Knowledge within themselves. Their thinking has been altered. They have been imprinted with images of human disaster and chaos. They have been convinced and changed, and now they see what their governors want them to see. They think what their governors want them to think. They think that they are being wise and spiritually enlightened, but really they have fallen into servitude—a cruel servitude, a servitude that will deny their humanity and their allegiance to their own kind. This is how serious a problem this is.</p>
<p>有些人已经被转化到了一种地步，以至于他们很难清晰地看清并触及他们内在内识的力量。他们的思维被改变了。他们被烙印上了人类灾难和混乱的形象。他们被说服并改变了，现在他们看到了他们的统治者希望他们看到的事情。他们思考着他们的统治者希望他们思考的事情。他们认为他们是明智的，并且在精神性上得到了开悟，但实际上他们已经陷入了奴役——一种残酷的奴役，一种将否认他们的人性和他们对同类的忠诚的奴役。这就是问题的严重性。</p>
<p>Surround yourself and protect yourself by saying Nasi Novare Coram, which is a protection [given by] the Angelic Presence. Build your inner strength and [connection] to Knowledge, for Knowledge cannot be persuaded. Knowledge cannot be induced or seduced. It cannot be overtaken. It remains strong and clear and cannot be violated. Knowledge is unknown to the Intervention, or it would not be here undertaking its dangerous and unnatural activities.</p>
<p>通过念诵“Nasi Novare Coram”来包围你自己并保护你自己，这是天使存在[给予的]保护。构建你的内在力量以及与内识的[联接]，因为内识无法被说服。内识无法被诱导或引诱。它无法被超越。它保持强大而明晰，无法被侵犯。内识不为干预所知，否则它不会在此开展其危险且非自然的活动。</p>
<p>Yet you must understand that your intellect can be overtaken. It has been overtaken by your family and your culture to a very great extent. How much more powerful will the Intervention’s persuasions be, those races who understand how minds can be changed, how defenses can be taken down and how minds can be infiltrated and imprinted and impressed.</p>
<p>然而你必须理解，你的智力是可以被超越的。它在很大程度上已经被你的家庭和你的文化超越了。那些理解如何改变心灵、如何攻破防御、如何渗透、烙印以及印记心灵的种族，他们的干预会有多么强大的说服力。</p>
<p>Even greater than the powers of your culture can these forms of persuasion be. Without the power of Knowledge in your awareness, you would feel almost helpless and impotent in the face of such persuasions if they were aimed at you directly.</p>
<p>这些说服形式的力量甚至可能比你们文化的力量还要强大。如果你的觉知中没有内识的力量，当这些说服直接针对你时，你几乎会感到无助和无能为力。</p>
<p>This is a crisis facing many people. Some people are not even aware that they have been targeted in this way. And those who have been taken against their will, their memories have been denied and blocked, and now they live with a kind of suppression within themselves. For if your memories have been blocked, so is your awareness of your deeper nature. So is your awareness of your inspiration, your wisdom and your insight. It is all subdued together, you see.</p>
<p>这是许多人面临的危机。有些人甚至没有察觉到他们以这种方式被瞄准。而那些被强行带走的人，他们的记忆被否定和封锁，现在他们生活在一种内在的压抑之中。因为如果你的记忆被封锁了，你对你更深层次自然的觉知也会被封锁。你对你的灵感、你的智慧和你的洞察力的觉知也会被封锁。你看，这一切都被压制了。</p>
<p>People are living in the shadows of anxiety and inexplicable fears. They sleep with the lights on in their bedroom and carry on other kinds of activities that reveal a very, very deep fear and apprehension.</p>
<p>人们生活在焦虑和莫名恐惧的阴影之下。他们开着卧室的灯睡觉，进行着各种活动，这些都暴露出他们内心深处的恐惧和不安。</p>
<p>Some of this, of course, is due to human trauma and has nothing to do with the Intervention. But for many people, the Intervention is a source of their great difficulty, their sense of compromise within themselves, the violation that has occurred in their lives and the unfortunate and unhappy consequences this produces for them every day.</p>
<p>当然，其中一些源于人类创伤，与干预无关。但对许多人来说，干预是他们巨大困境的根源，是他们内在妥协感的根源，是他们生活中发生的侵犯，以及这每天给他们带来的不幸和不快乐后果的根源。</p>
<p>You must gain the strength to oppose the Intervention. But to do this, you must become aware of it clearly, without confusion. You must be building your awareness of Knowledge, for that is the source of your strength, your courage and your determination. You must become increasingly aware that that deeper part of you cannot be violated and persuaded, and that only your intellect, if it is unprepared and not guided by Knowledge, will be vulnerable to the powers of these persuasions.</p>
<p>你必须获得实力来对抗干预。但要做到这一点，你必须清晰地、毫无困惑地察觉到它。你必须构建你对内识的觉知，因为这是你的力量、你的勇气和你的决心的源泉。你必须越来越察觉，你内心的那个更深层次的部分无法被侵犯和说服，只有你的智力，如果它没有准备，没有被内识指引，才会容易受到这些说服力量的伤害。</p>
<p>The New Message provides a greater preparation. It is not something you can learn by basically a few simple concepts or recommendations. It is not something you can learn in a weekend, for you are preparing yourself to confront the realities of the Greater Community. It is not only that there is an Intervention in the world at this time. It is that humanity is facing a greater reality for which it is unprepared.</p>
<p>新讯息提供了一种更伟大的准备。它并非你通过一些简单的概念或建议就能学到的东西。它并非你在一个周末就能学到的东西，因为你正在准备你自己去面对大社区的现实。它不仅仅是因为此刻世界上存在着一种干预。而是人类正在面对一个它尚未准备好的更伟大现实。</p>
<p>The hour is late, and the Intervention is already underway. It is gaining its converts. It is turning people to its persuasions. It is a powerful force. It is seeking to influence individuals in positions of leadership in government, religion and commerce. Certain individuals have been targeted for this purpose.</p>
<p>时辰已晚，干预已然展开。它正在获得它的皈依者。它正在将人们引向它的说服力。它是一股强大的力量。它正在寻求影响政府、宗教和商业领域中身居领导地位的个体。某些个体已经被列为目标。</p>
<p>Governments will not reveal what they know, and the public remains blind and vulnerable. Who will alert them? Who will teach them? Who will begin to spread the wisdom that humanity is being infiltrated at a subtle but pervasive level? Who can begin to prepare and teach people about the realities of life in the universe?</p>
<p>政府不愿透露他们所知，公众依然处于盲目和脆弱的状态。谁来提醒他们？谁来教导他们？谁来传播人类正被某种微妙却无孔不入的渗透的智慧？谁能开始为人们做好准备，并教导他们关于宇宙生命的现实？</p>
<p>God has provided this teaching and this preparation as part of the New Message for humanity. It is a vital part of the New Message because it is a critical problem and threshold for the human family and for every individual who has been influenced, targeted and taken against their will. To whatever degree they have been influenced, they themselves are already feeling the impact of the Intervention, and they are living with its unfortunate consequences every day.</p>
<p>上帝提供了这个教导和这个准备，作为致人类的新讯息的一部分。它是新讯息至关重要的组成部分，因为它对人类大家庭以及对每一个受到影响、被针对和被强行带走的个体来说，都是一个关键问题和门槛。无论他们受到影响的程度如何，他们自己都已感受到干预的冲击，并且他们每天都生活在其不幸的后果之中。</p>
<p>Therefore, you first must become educated about the Greater Community and the Intervention so that you can see clearly what you are dealing with. It is not a mystery because it is part of nature. It is one group seeking to gain control of the minds and lives of others to utilize their environment and their resources—in this case, the world’s natural resources, which are extremely valuable in the Greater Community, a Greater Community of barren worlds.</p>
<p>因此，你首先必须学习关于大社区和干预的知识，这样你才能清楚地看到你正在应对的事情。它并非神秘，因为它是自然的一部分。它是一个群体试图控制他人的心灵和生命，以利用他们的环境和资源——在此情况下，是世界的自然资源，这些资源在大社区，一个由贫瘠世界组成的大社区里极其宝贵。</p>
<p>Your Greater Community education then must begin. It must be an essential and core part of your preparation, not only for the Greater Community itself but to undo the effects of the Intervention, to whatever extent they have been placed upon you.</p>
<p>那么，你的大社区教育必须开始。它必须是你准备的一个必要且核心的部分，不仅是为了大社区本身，也是为了消除干预的影响，无论它们被施加于你的程度如何。</p>
<p>You must look at this dispassionately, objectively and honestly. If your mind has been influenced, if an attempt has been made to overtake it, then you must free yourself through great focus and effort and not succumb to the idea that you are weak and helpless. The Intervention will promote the idea, amongst those that it focuses upon, that resistance is futile and that they more than you understand the needs of humanity and what will restore the human family and prevent the world from catastrophe.</p>
<p>你必须冷静、客观、诚实地看待这一切。如果你的心灵受到影响，如果有人试图克服它，那么你必须通过伟大的专注和努力来解放你自己，而不是屈服于你软弱无助的想法。干预将在其关注的人群中推广这种想法：抵抗是徒劳的，他们比你们更理解人类的需求，以及什么将重建人类大家庭并阻止世界免于灾难。</p>
<p>This is part of their discouragement. If they cannot win you over with promises of peace, wealth and happiness, then they will try to discourage you—to make you feel weak and impotent, helpless, without hope of opposing their presence and their purpose in the world.</p>
<p>这是他们令人沮丧的一部分。如果他们无法用和平、财富和幸福的承诺赢得你，那么他们就会试图让你沮丧——让你感到软弱、无能、无助，没有希望对抗他们的存在以及他们在世界上的目的。</p>
<p>The Allies of Humanity Briefings and the Teaching in the New Message together will provide you a clear understanding, and it will be an understanding that you will be able to comprehend easily because it reflects the lessons of nature and the lessons of your own history in this world—the lessons of intervention, the lessons of competition in nature, and what peoples and nations must do to become free from Intervention, in this case an intervention into the minds and the hearts of people.</p>
<p>人类盟友的简报和新讯息里的教导将共同为你提供清晰的理解，这将是你能够轻松理解的一种理解，因为它反映了自然的教训以及你们自身在这个世界的历史的教训——干预的教训，自然竞争的教训，以及民众和国家必须做些什么才能摆脱干预，在这种情况下，干预是对民众心灵和内心的干预。</p>
<p>It is an Intervention much more subtle and pervasive than what people would expect. Most people would think intervention would be military, a great show of force—the destruction of human infrastructure or human cities as a show of power. This is because humanity still thinks in brutish terms and does not realize that in the Greater Community, the part of space that you live in, such acts of conquest are not allowed and that more subtle and pervasive methods must be employed if one race seeks to gain influence and dominance over another.</p>
<p>它是一种比人们预期更加微妙和普遍的干预。大多数人会认为干预将是军事的，一场大规模的武力展示——摧毁人类的基础设施或人类的城市，以此来炫耀权力。这是因为人类依然以野蛮的思维方式思考，没有意识到在大社区，在你们所居住的太空部分，这样的征服行为是不被允许的，如果一个种族试图获得对另一个种族的影响力和统治，就必须采用更加微妙和普遍的手段。</p>
<p>The Intervention cannot live in your world. Its biological hazard is far too great. It cannot deal with the perils of your environment. Therefore, it needs a human infrastructure, a human workforce, if not allegiant then at least compliant to its purposes and its will here. It will offer you anything to persuade you that it, more than you, that it, more than human leadership, will provide the road to salvation, peace and equanimity in the world.</p>
<p>干预无法生活在你们的世界。它的生物危害太过巨大。它无法应对你们环境的危险。因此，它需要一个人类基础设施，一个人类劳动力，即使不忠诚，至少也要顺从它在此的目的和意志。它会提供任何东西来说服你们，它，比你们，比人类领导，更能提供通往世界救赎、和平与安宁的道路。</p>
<p>But it is all a deception and clever, for humanity has been studied for a long time. Your aspirations are understood. Your fears are understood. Your weaknesses are understood. Your history is understood. Humanity is broadcasting out into space all of its conflicts, its disagreements and its lack of unity and wisdom.</p>
<p>但这一切都是欺骗，而且很狡猾，因为人类已被研究了很久。你们的渴望被理解。你们的恐惧被理解。你们的弱点被理解。你们的历史被理解。人类正在向太空播放它所有的冲突、它的分歧以及它缺乏的团结与智慧。</p>
<p>Those who have been influenced by the Intervention, to whatever degree this influence has been placed upon them or focused upon them, are in the best position to warn and to alert other people about the dangers and the consequences of this Intervention into the world. But they must be prepared to do this, or their warnings will be unwise and will be desperate and fearful.</p>
<p>那些受到干预影响的人们，无论这种影响在多大程度上被施加于他们或聚焦于他们，都处于最佳位置去警告和警示其他人关于这种干预对世界的危险和后果。但他们必须准备这样做，否则他们的警告将是无知的，将是绝望的和恐惧的。</p>
<p>You are dealing with a very cunning force, a force that is highly organized, though small in size and without military resources. Yet it is intelligent. It is focused. Therefore, you must be intelligent and focused to deal with it and to have an influence upon others, an influence upon your nations and governments, warning of the Intervention, pointing to the preparation that is in the world today, the only preparation of its kind that can prepare humanity for the dangers and the opportunities of emerging into a Greater Community of life.</p>
<p>你正在应对一支非常狡猾的势力，一支高度组织化的势力，尽管规模小，没有军事资源。然而它是智能的。它专注。因此，你必须聪慧和专注来应对它，并对他人施加影响，对你们的国家和政府施加影响，对干预发出警告，指向当今世界正在进行的准备，这是同类中唯一能够让人类为迈进生命大社区的危险和机遇进行准备的准备。</p>
<p>The Greater Community is a competitive reality on a scale you can barely imagine—a reality where the powers of mind and influence are cultivated and used to a far greater degree than they are here in the world; a reality where everyone is seeking resources. The more advanced their technology, the more they must engage in complex networks of trade and commerce to secure what they need.</p>
<p>大社区是一个你几乎无法想象规模的竞争性现实——在这个现实中，心灵和影响力的力量被培养和运用到远超其在这个世界存在的程度；在这个现实中，每个种族都在寻求资源。他们的科技越先进，他们就越需要参与复杂的贸易和商业网络来获取他们所需的资源。</p>
<p>It is a very different prospect than what most people assume and expect. It is unlike your movies and your science fiction, which just project human ambitions and human fantasies. But you are facing a non-human universe where your projections will have little meaning, and your expectations can be extremely foolish and dangerous.</p>
<p>它是一个与大多数人设想和预期截然不同的前景。它不同于你们的电影和科幻小说，它们只是投射人类的野心和幻想。但你们面对的是一个非人类的宇宙，在那里，你们的预测将毫无意义，你们的期望可能极其愚蠢和危险。</p>
<p>The Intervention is here because humanity is destroying the value of the world. It is here because humanity has created an infrastructure, a worldwide network of communication that it can use. It is a growing presence with a long-term and a long-range plan. You must learn of this. And the Revelation of this has been provided.</p>
<p>干预之所以存在，是因为人类正在摧毁世界的价值。干预之所以存在，是因为人类创造了一个基础设施，一个它能够利用的全球通讯网络。它是一个不断增长的存在，带着一个长期的、长远的计划。你必须了解这一点。关于这一点的启示已经被提供了。</p>
<p>Look into your own mind and heart and ask yourself: “Have I been influenced by this Intervention? Has it impacted me? Does it know of me?”</p>
<p>审视你自身的心灵和内心，问问你自己：“我是否受到了这种干预的影响？它是否影响了我？它是否知道我？”</p>
<p>Three questions—the answer is either yes or no. But you must feel the answer deeply within you. It cannot simply be an intellectual exercise. It is not hypothetical. It is elemental and fundamental to your nature, to your life and to your experience.</p>
<p>三个问题——答案要么是“是”，要么是“否”。但你必须在内心深处感受答案。它不能仅仅是一场智力练习。它不是假设。它是你的自然、你的生命和你经历的元素和根本。</p>
<p>If the answer is yes to any or all of these questions, then you must engage in the preparation with great seriousness and commitment because your life has been taken from you to a certain degree, and you must gain it back. You must restore yourself. You must set boundaries and be able to exercise your authority sufficiently so that the Intervention cannot have influence upon you.</p>
<p>如果对其中任何一个或所有问题的答案是肯定的，那么你必须带着极大的严肃性和投入去参与准备，因为你的生命在某种程度上已被夺走，你必须夺回它。你必须重建你自己。你必须设定界限，并能够充分地运用你的权威，这样干预就无法对你产生影响。</p>
<p>You must understand that who you are is not your mind and your intellect, and that you can stand apart from your intellect and guide it and direct it according to a greater will and power within yourself. In this way, that which is strong within you can guide that which is weak. That which is invulnerable can guide that which is vulnerable.</p>
<p>你必须理解，你是谁并非你的心灵和智力，你可以脱离你的智力，根据你内在更伟大的意志和力量来引导和指挥它。如此一来，你内在的强大能够引导你的软弱。你内在的无敌能够引导你的脆弱。</p>
<p>But to achieve this is a very great preparation with many steps and stages. It involves taking the Steps to Knowledge and gaining a real Greater Community education. It involves plumbing the depths of your own experience; setting aside fear and avoidance; being with yourself; and exploring your states, your condition, your beliefs and your attitudes with a greater objectivity and a greater clarity.</p>
<p>但要实现这一点，需要进行非常伟大的准备，包含许多步骤和阶段。它涉及开展内识进阶，并获得真正的大社区教育。它涉及探究你自身体验的深度；抛开恐惧和回避；与你自己相处；并以更客观和更清晰的态度探索你的状态、你的境况、你的信仰和你的态度。</p>
<p>God has an answer to this great and unseen problem. God has given you the power of Knowledge to guide you, to protect you and to bless you. But only through the New Revelation is this power revealed clearly, without the overlay of human history, conflict and tragedy, in a pure form that is very accessible. You can find this through your religious traditions, but you would need a very wise teacher to guide you, and such a teacher may be difficult to find.</p>
<p>上帝对这个伟大而隐秘的问题有一个答案。上帝赋予了你内识的力量来指引你、保护你并祝福你。但唯有通过新启示，这种力量才能清晰地被揭示，不带人类历史、冲突和悲剧的叠加，以一种纯粹且易于触及的形式。你可以通过你的宗教传统找到它，但你需要一位非常明智的老师来指引你，而这样的老师或许很难找到。</p>
<p>Ask yourself these three questions with as much honesty and objectivity as you can. Ask yourself repeatedly over time. Do not be satisfied with only doing it once. You are trying to gain access to your deeper experience. And if this experience has been blocked, then you must try to break through the resistance within yourself, to break down the wall that has been built around your inner awareness and experience so that you may gain access to it.</p>
<p>尽可能诚实客观地问你自己这三个问题。反复地问你自己。不要满足于只问一次。你正在努力触及你更深层次的体验。如果这种体验被阻碍了，那么你必须努力突破你内在的阻力，打破围绕你内在觉知和体验的那堵墙，这样你才能触及它。</p>
<p>This is a very significant and important matter. Do not make light of it, and do not share it with others who cannot appreciate its importance. Be very careful who you share your own experience of the Intervention with, for many people will dispute it. Many people will make fun of it and diminish it, for in the consensus of human thought, it is not considered possible or realistic.</p>
<p>这是一件非常重要且意义重大的事情。不要轻视它，也不要与那些无法领会其重要性的人们分享它。要非常谨慎地与谁分享你自身的干预体验，因为很多人会对此提出质疑。很多人会嘲笑它、贬低它，因为在人类思想的共识中，它被认为是不可能或不现实的。</p>
<p>Here you must value your own experience over that which seems to prevail in human thinking and awareness, which is largely blind and controlled by forces that most people do not even understand.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须珍视你自身的体验，而非那些似乎在人类思维和觉知中盛行的事物，它们很大程度上是盲目的，并被大多数人甚至无法理解的驱动力所控制。</p>
<p>You must gain this strength, this self-confidence and this sense of integrity. If you have been influenced by the Intervention or affected by it in any way, then you will have to regain what has been lost and compromised. The means to do this are now with you and available to you.</p>
<p>你必须获得这种实力、这种自信和这种完整性。如果你受到了干预的影响，或者以任何方式受到了它的影响，那么你必须重新获得那些已经失去和妥协的东西。做到这一点的途径现在就在你手中，并且对你可用。</p>
