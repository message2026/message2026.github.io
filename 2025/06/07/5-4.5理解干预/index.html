<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on February 25, 2000 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2000 年 2 月 25 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Allies of Humanity Briefings will arouse many questions. This is good because these questions must be asked and considered. It is not merely that answers should be readily given, but that the questions be deeply considered and that the questioners think for themselves what the answers could possibly be.</p>
<p>人类盟友的简报将引发诸多疑问。这很好，因为这些问题必须被提出和思考。不仅要迅速给出答案，更要深入思考这些问题，并让提问者为自己思考答案可能是什么。</p>
<p>If humanity is ever to become strong and self-determined within the Greater Community, then it must have more people who can think independently and critically and consider things deeply.</p>
<p>如果人类想要在大社区中变得强大和自决，那么就必须拥有更多能够独立、批判性地思考并深入考虑事物的人。</p>
<p>The Allies themselves will remain mysterious. For some people, this will be difficult, but it must be this way, for the Allies really are spying on the Intervention, and to protect themselves, the Allies must remain hidden.</p>
<p>盟友本身将保持神秘。对一些人来说，这将是困难的，但必须如此，因为盟友确实在监视干预，而为了保护他们自己，盟友必须保持隐匿。</p>
<p>The Allies themselves will not divulge much information about their origin, their identities and so forth. They claim that this information would be meaningless to people, but really the greater reason for this is that the Allies want to maintain their anonymity. This anonymity protects them and their sources.</p>
<p>盟友本身不愿透露太多关于他们出身、身份等等的信息。他们声称这些信息对人们来说毫无意义，但实际上，更大的原因是盟友希望保持匿名。这种匿名性保护了他们自己以及他们的消息来源。</p>
<p>It is perhaps difficult to accept these things at first because people do not understand the difficulties of life in the Greater Community. They do not understand how Knowledge must be transmitted from one race to another, particularly when there is a situation like an Intervention underway.</p>
<p>一开始或许很难接受这些事情，因为人们不理解大社区生命的艰辛。他们不理解内识必须如何从一个种族传递到另一个种族，尤其是在像干预这样的情况正在进行的时候。</p>
<p>In a manner of speaking, humanity is under siege, though perhaps this seems too strong a word because the activities of the “visitors” seem so subtle and evasive. But given the results of this Intervention, the word “siege” here really is appropriate.</p>
<p>某种程度上来说，人类正遭受围攻，尽管这个词或许显得过于强烈，因为“来访者”的活动显得如此微妙和躲躲闪闪。但鉴于此次干预的后果，“围攻”一词在此的确恰如其分。</p>
<p>If you try to help another nation that is under siege and you want to remain hidden, then you have to protect yourself and your sources and communicate in such a way that the message can be dispensed effectively with minimum risk of the information being destroyed or corrupted in any way.</p>
<p>如果你试图帮助另一个被围困的国家，并且你想保持隐匿，那么你必须保护你自己和你的讯息来源，并以有效的方式进行交流，同时将讯息被破坏或损坏的风险降至最低。</p>
<p>This is why the message is being given to one person. If it were given to many people, they could perhaps misinterpret it, and they would have different versions of what they had been given, and then they would contend with each other, and the whole message could be lost or corrupted.</p>
<p>这就是为什么讯息只传递给一个人。如果讯息传递给许多人，他们可能会曲解，对收到的讯息会有不同版本，然后他们会互相争论，最终导致整个讯息丢失或损坏。</p>
<p>As long as this one person can continue to receive the information, and if he has enough support around him, then this is the best protection against misunderstanding and against conflict arising. Since this is information that humanity cannot gain on its own, it must be delivered by those in the Greater Community who are attempting to help you and who are concerned about your freedom in the future.</p>
<p>只要这个人能够继续接收信息，并且如果他周围有足够的支持，那么这就是防止误解和冲突发生的最佳保护。由于这些讯息人类无法自行获得，它必须由大社区中那些试图帮助你们、关心你们未来自由的盟友来传递。</p>
<p>How can humanity on its own understand the intricacies of relations in the Greater Community? This is not possible. And if any attempt were made to explain these things, well, it would seem fantastic, and people would have no way of verifying it for themselves, unless of course they were strong with Knowledge.</p>
<p>人类它自身如何能够理解大社区中错综复杂的关系？这是不可能的。如果有人试图解释这些事情，嗯，那看起来会很不可思议，而且人们无法亲自验证，除非他们拥有强大的内识。</p>
<p>Therefore, the Allies will remain mysterious. Some people will understand this. Some people will not understand this. The Allies cannot reveal much about their own history beyond what they have told you in the Briefings. Some people can accept this. Others will become suspicious. But what we are really talking about here is discretion.</p>
<p>因此，盟友将继续保持神秘。有些人会理解这一点，有些人则不会理解。除了他们在简报中告诉你们的内容之外，盟友不能透露太多关于他们自身历史的信息。有些人可以接受这一点，而另一些人则会心生疑虑。但我们真正要讨论的是谨慎。</p>
<p>You do not reveal everything to people at the outset when they can barely understand or accept your initial offerings. Their first questions must go unanswered because they do not have enough trust in their contact, and they do not have enough trust in their own Knowledge, the spiritual Intelligence within them, to be able to discern what is true and what is not true.</p>
<p>当人们几乎无法理解或接受你最初的提议时，你不能一开始就向他们透露一切。他们的第一个问题必须得到解答，因为他们对他们的接触没有足够的信任，对他们自身的内识、他们内在的精神智能没有足够的信任，以至于无法辨别什么是真实的，什么是虚假的。</p>
<p>Because there is so little honesty in the world, what is truly honest will be suspected and will be considered devious, especially by those who are devious themselves. It is, in fact, very difficult to present something pure to the world without it being defiled or compromised, even at the outset.</p>
<p>因为世上的诚实是如此稀少，真正的诚实也会受到怀疑，甚至被认为是不诚实的，尤其是那些本身就不诚实的人。事实上，要将纯粹的讯息呈现给世界而不被玷污或损害，即使在一开始就很困难。</p>
<p>The one person chosen to receive these messages is chosen because he has no position in the world, because he has no social standing and because he has been well prepared for this. Yes, he will have questions, and he does. Yes, he will be afraid of certain things, and he has been. But as long as he can receive the message and present it in a pure form, whether he himself can fully understand it or not, that is the important thing.</p>
<p>被选中接收这些讯息的人，是因为他在世上没有地位，没有社会名望，也因为他已经为此做好了充分的准备。是的，他会有疑问，他确实有。是的，他会害怕某些事情，他确实有。但只要他能接收讯息，并以纯粹的形式呈现它，无论他自己是否能完全理解，讯息才是最重要的。</p>
<p>Because the message is in a pure form and does not conform to people’s expectations, preferences or beliefs, at the outset not everyone will be able to comprehend it. And there will be much discussion and much suspicion, and many fears will be projected upon it, particularly by people whose previous understanding is challenged in any way by this new revelation.</p>
<p>由于这个讯息的形式纯粹，不符合人们的期望、偏好或信仰，一开始并非所有人都能理解它。届时将会出现大量的讨论、大量的怀疑和恐惧，尤其是那些先前的理解在任何方面都受到这个新启示挑战的人。</p>
<p>Obviously, people would want the Allies to be many things. They would want the Allies to be saviors. They would want the Allies to be rescuers. They would want the Allies to intervene and prevent any other Greater Community force from having access to your world. And people will feel, perhaps, like they have been betrayed or let down because the Allies are not here to protect humanity. But think about this.</p>
<p>显然，人们希望盟友扮演各种角色。他们希望盟友成为救世主。他们希望盟友成为救援者。他们希望盟友介入，阻止任何其他大社区势力进入你们的世界。人们或许会感到被背叛或失望，因为盟友并非来保护人类的。但请思考一下。</p>
<p>If the Allies were here to protect humanity, they would have to continue to protect humanity, which would require them, in effect, to take control of your world. All governments in your world would then have to be coordinated with the activities of the Allies. This then would lead to your loss of freedom, even loss of freedom to a friend.</p>
<p>如果盟友来此是为了保护人类，他们就必须继续保护人类，这实际上意味着他们必须控制你们的世界。你们世界的所有政府都必须与盟友的活动协调一致。这将导致你们失去自由，甚至朋友也失去自由。</p>
<p>It is not the Allies’ purpose to circumvent human authority. It is not their purpose to change governments or allegiances between nations. Their purpose is only to observe the Intervention and to deliver their commentaries.</p>
<p>盟友的目的并非规避人类权威。他们的目的并非改变政府或国家间的联盟。他们的目的仅仅是观察干预并传递他们的评注。</p>
<p>If you want someone to save you, you will give them your power to do so. The Allies will not accept this. And even if they mounted a force necessary to eject the visitors who are interfering in human affairs, to end the Intervention, well, you would have warfare at your borders. And even the Allies’ home worlds would be threatened because they are here without any official permission from other worlds or from trading unions or anything like this.</p>
<p>如果你希望有人拯救你，你就必须赋予他们你的权力。盟友不会接受这一点。即使他们动用必要的力量驱逐干涉人类事务的外来者，结束干预，你们的边境也会爆发战争。甚至盟友的母星也会受到威胁，因为他们未经其他星球、贸易联盟或类似机构的官方许可就来到这里。</p>
<p>What we mean by this is that the Allies are really not supposed to be here doing what they are doing. If you think about this, you will understand. Even in your world, your governments have secret agents trying to get information, trying to intervene in certain ways, either for good or for ill.</p>
<p>我们这么说的意思是，盟友真的不应该在这里做他们正在做的事情。如果你仔细想想，你就会理解。即使在你们的世界，你们的政府也有秘密特工试图获取情报，试图以某种方式进行干预，无论是好是坏。</p>
<p>The only thing that is going to save humanity is humanity itself. And for this to be possible, humanity must have a greater understanding and take a very sober and objective approach to life in the universe. As it is now, generally speaking, most people take a very romantic view of life in the universe.</p>
<p>唯一能够拯救人类的只有人类自身。而要做到这一点，人类必须对宇宙生命有一种更伟大的理解，并采取非常清醒客观的态度。目前，大多数人普遍对宇宙生命抱有非常浪漫的看法。</p>
<p>They are dazzled by technology and want more. They think “Contact” will bring them untold benefits. They think that advanced nations will teach humanity how to live in peace, how to maintain the environment and how to elevate the standard of living for people everywhere.</p>
<p>他们被科技所震撼，渴望更多。他们认为“接触”会给他们带来难以言喻的好处。他们认为发达国家会教会人类如何和平共处，如何维护环境，如何提升世界各地人民的生活水平。</p>
<p>Think about this. Is this possible? Do you think people want to have their lives changed and controlled by unknown forces? The visitors may promise these things because it feeds right into people’s expectations and desires.</p>
<p>想想看。这可能吗？你认为人们会希望他们的生活被未知的势力改变和控制吗？来访者之所以会承诺这些事情，是因为它恰好迎合了人们的期望和渴望。</p>
<p>The visitors tell people, “Oh, of course, we will give you peace and equanimity. We have no war.” Do you wish to give over the authority of your life and have your life and circumstances completely controlled for a mere promise of greater technology or a promise of peace and equanimity in the world? There is peace in the prison because everyone is controlled. But is this really peace? Or is this simply the restraint of war?</p>
<p>来访者告诉人们：“哦，当然，我们会给你们和平与平等。我们没有战争。”难道你们愿意仅仅为了更先进的科技承诺，或者世界和平与平等的承诺，就放弃对你生命的掌控，让你的生命和境遇完全被掌控吗？监狱里之所以和平，是因为每个人都被控制着。但这真的是和平吗？或者这仅仅是战争的克制？</p>
<p>Then there are people in the world whose financial positions will be threatened by the Intervention, and they will either resist the Intervention to protect their wealth and their privileges, or they will attempt to unite with the Intervention for their own benefit. Their uniting with the Intervention represents a very dangerous scenario, and one must be quite sober and objective to deal with it effectively.</p>
<p>然后，世界上有些人的财务状况将受到干预的威胁，他们要么抵制干预以保护他们的财富和特权，要么为了自身利益试图与干预联合。他们与干预的联合代表着一种非常危险的局面，我们必须非常清醒和客观才能有效地应对它。</p>
<p>Many people will simply go into denial and say, “Well, this can’t possibly be! I don’t believe this. Advanced civilizations don’t behave like this. And if they are here, they could help us, and we should welcome them!”</p>
<p>很多人会直接否认，说：“这不可能！我不相信。先进文明不会这样做。如果他们真的存在，他们就能帮助我们，我们应该欢迎他们！”</p>
<p>And of course there are many people who simply cannot even consider these things because the reality of the Intervention is beyond their range of comprehension entirely. Life in the universe? Well, fine, maybe at the far ends of the galaxy, but not here!</p>
<p>当然，很多人根本无法考虑这些事情，因为干预的现实完全超出了他们的理解范围。宇宙中的生命？好吧，也许在银河系的尽头，但这里不是！</p>
<p>And then there will be people who will say, “Oh, these Allies are right! We have to defend ourselves! Let’s build bunkers and live underground and store up weapons and mistrust everyone and everything.”</p>
<p>然后会有人说：“哦，这些盟友说得对！我们必须保卫我们自己！让我们建立掩体，住在地下，储存武器，不信任任何人、任何事。”</p>
<p>So it is possible that The Allies Briefings may create some hysteria. It is certain there will be denial. It is certain they will be condemned and attacked by people from different viewpoints. But this is the risk that must be taken when a vital message is delivered, into your world or into any world.</p>
<p>因此，盟友的简报可能会引发一些歇斯底里。肯定会有人否认。肯定会遭到不同观点人士的谴责和攻击。但当一个至关重要的讯息传递到你们的世界或任何世界时，这是必须承担的风险。</p>
<p>Can the truth be received here without anxiety and condemnation? Well, look at the history of the great spiritual Teachers who have become public with their messages. That gives you a very good demonstration. A few people are reached, and many are outraged. There will be outrage over The Allies Briefings, but a few people will be reached, and they will be able to reach other people.</p>
<p>真理能在这里被毫无焦虑和谴责地接受吗？好吧，看看那些将他们的讯息公开的伟大精神老师的历史吧。这给了你一个很好的例证。少数人被触及，而许多人则感到愤怒。盟友的简报会引发愤怒，但少数人会被触及，而他们也能够触及其他人。</p>
<p>And over time, a new understanding and awareness will slowly work its way into the human consciousness. This awareness is vitally important, for humanity is grossly unprepared for the Greater Community, so unprepared, in fact, that the situation has become rather desperate. Something has to be done or humanity will give away the keys to the kingdom freely, openly, with very little question.</p>
<p>随着时间的推移，一种新的理解和觉知将逐渐渗入人类意识。这种觉知至关重要，因为人类对大社区的准备极其不足，事实上，如此的不足以至于情况变得相当危急。必须有所行动，否则人类将毫无顾忌地、公开地、毫不犹豫地交出王国的钥匙。</p>
<p>Look at the history of the peoples of your world, the native peoples of the world, those who simply acquiesced and said, “Oh, yes, fine. Welcome. Move on in. We’ll live here, and you can live over there, and everything will be fine.” Look what happened here. Is this new scenario really very different? It is a very difficult situation to be the race that is discovered, to be the natives of a new world, being visited by others who seek the values and wealth and opportunities of the new world. Such is the predicament that humanity is in now.</p>
<p>看看你们世界上那些民族的历史，看看那些原住民的历史，他们只是默许并说：“哦，好的，好的。欢迎。搬进来。我们住在这里，你们住在那里，一切都会好起来的。”看看这里发生了什么。这个新的场景真的非常不同吗？作为一个被发现的种族，作为一个新世界的原住民，被其他寻求新世界价值观、财富和机遇的种族拜访，这是一个非常艰难的处境。这就是人类现在所处的困境。</p>
<p>Yet is this a great tragedy? It could become a great tragedy, depending on how people respond. However, it is also a great opportunity, for the presence of forces from the Greater Community intervening into human affairs is really the one great chance for humanity to unite itself and to become strong in its own defense. It takes something of this magnitude to overcome the tribal animosities and histories between cultures. It takes something greater, a greater problem, to unite people.</p>
<p>然而，这是一场巨大的悲剧吗？它可能成为一场巨大的悲剧，取决于人们如何回应。然而，这也是一个伟大的机会，因为来自大社区的势力存在介入人类事务，实际上是人类团结自身、增强自身防御能力的唯一伟大机会。需要如此重大的事情来克服不同文化之间的部落仇恨和历史隔阂。它需要一种更大的事情，一个更艰巨的问题，来团结人们。</p>
<p>It is like being in a house on fire. If people in one room won’t speak to people in another room, and the people upstairs hate the people downstairs, and the house is on fire, well, you either help each other, or you perish. The world is like a house on fire. It is on fire through environmental degradation and through increasing conflicts between nations and cultures. But the greater fire in the world is the presence of the visitors. The greater fire is the Intervention.</p>
<p>它就像身处一栋着火的房子里。如果一个房间里的人不愿与另一个房间里的人交谈，楼上的人憎恨楼下的人，而房子着火了，那么，你们要么互相帮助，要么灭亡。世界就像一栋着火的房子。它因环境恶化以及国家和文化之间日益加剧的冲突而着火。但世界上更大的火是来访者的存在。更大的火是干预。</p>
<p>Humanity can deal with these other problems though it has not done so sufficiently yet. But can it deal with the presence of those from beyond the world who possess skills that humanity has not yet cultivated? You can clean up your own backyard. You can change the structure of government. You can slowly, with great difficulty, bring greater justice into the world, and indeed this must be done. But can you deal with the reality of intelligent life from beyond your world without romance, without hopeful expectation, without greed?</p>
<p>人类能够应对这些其他问题，尽管它尚未充分做到。但它能够应对那些来自世界之外、拥有人类尚未培养的技能的外来者存在吗？你们可以清理你们自己的后院。你们可以改变政府结构。你们可以缓慢地、艰难地为世界带来更大的正义，而且这确实必须做到。但你们能够不带浪漫情怀、不带希望的期待、不带贪婪地应对来自你们世界之外的智能生命的现实吗？</p>
<p>Can you deal with this objectively and honestly? Can you say to the visitors, “All right, if you are here, then you must reveal yourselves and your intentions, and we will determine if you have a right to be here or not!”</p>
<p>你能客观诚实地处理这个问题吗？你能对来访者说：“好吧，既然你们来了，就必须表明你们的身份和意图，我们会决定你们是否有权待在这里！”</p>
<p>As the Allies describe in their Briefings, humanity should not let any foreign race upon its soil without permission from the population. Obviously, under current circumstances, this permission was never asked for and never granted. That is why it is an Intervention and not a visitation.</p>
<p>正如盟友在其简报中所述，人类不应允许任何外来种族未经当地居民许可而踏足其领土。显然，在当前情况下，这种许可从未被请求，也从未被授予。正因如此，这是一次干预，而非一次探访。</p>
<p>Visitors are welcomed in. They have asked permission to visit. They are here on a visit, with the permission of those being visited. But an Intervention does not have this permission. It is forced upon you.</p>
<p>欢迎来访者。他们请求了访问许可。他们来此访问，得到了被访者的许可。但干预没有这种许可。它是强加于你们的。</p>
<p>Some people may say, “Perhaps the visitors did ask for permission, and it was denied by the governments of the world.” Well, even if this were the case, the visitors should be on their way and not be here. Even if the governments of the world made a mistake in not welcoming the visitation, if it was not welcomed, then the visitors should not be here—unless they came to conquer and to intervene for this purpose.</p>
<p>有些人可能会说：“或许来访者确实请求过许可，但遭到了世界各国政府的拒绝。”好吧，即便如此，来访者也应该继续前行，而不是留在这里。即便世界各国政府没有欢迎探访是一个错误，但如果它不受欢迎，那么来访者就不应该在这里——除非他们是为了征服和干预而来。</p>
<p>Why else would they be here and getting so involved in human affairs, taking such great interest in human physiology, psychology and religion? Do you think they are lacking these things and that is why they are visiting? Do you think they are going to steal the books out of your library?</p>
<p>不然他们为什么会来这里，如此关心人类事务，对人类的生理、心理和宗教如此感兴趣？你认为他们缺乏这些东西，所以才来这里吗？你认为他们会偷走你们图书馆里的书籍吗？</p>
<p>They could get all this information simply by being observers and collecting all of your data and information and transmissions and so forth. They would not need to be here interfering in human affairs to learn about you. Some people think, “Well, they need our reproductive abilities.” Or “They need our spirituality.” Or “They need our emotions.” Or “They need our religion.” This is all foolishness. This is turning a blind eye to the obvious.</p>
<p>他们只需作为观察者，收集你们的所有数据、信息、传输等等，就能获得所有这些信息。他们无需在这里干涉人类事务就能了解你们。有些人会想：“嗯，他们需要我们的生殖能力。”或者“他们需要我们的精神性。”或者“他们需要我们的情感。”或者“他们需要我们的宗教。”这都是愚蠢的。这是对显而易见的事实视而不见。</p>
<p>Why do nations intervene with one another? Think about this. It is no different in the Greater Community. The obvious is being missed.</p>
<p>国家之间为何要互相干涉？想想看。大社区也一样。显而易见的事情却被忽略了。</p>
<p>People want to think of it in other ways because it is easier to deal with. For goodness sakes, yes! Some people say, “Oh, they are here because they need our help! They need our blood supplies. Or they need our religion and we will help them and we will feel so good about ourselves and they will be so grateful.”</p>
<p>人们总想换个角度思考，因为这样更容易处理。天哪，的确如此！有些人会说：“哦，他们来这里是因为需要我们的帮助！他们需要我们的血液供应。或者他们需要我们的宗教，我们会帮助他们，我们会感觉很好，他们也会非常感激。”</p>
<p>Some people think, “Well, they are here to bring us new technology and help us end pollution.” Do you think people and governments would use this new technology in such a way? Nations in the world would step upon each other to have this new technology for superiority and strength because nations are competing with each other.</p>
<p>有些人认为：“嗯，他们来这里是为了给我们带来新技术，帮助我们消除污染。”你认为人们和政府会这样利用这项新技术吗？世界各国会为了争夺这项新技术而互相竞争，争夺优势和实力。</p>
<p>Some people say, “Well, they are here because they want to study us.” Why would they want to study you? They could study you by receiving your transmissions, which are being projected out into space. Your information is very accessible. It does not require them to be here to study you. And why would they want to study you anyway?</p>
<p>有人说：“嗯，他们来这里是想研究我们。”他们为什么要研究你们？他们可以通过接收你们的传输信息来研究你们，这些传输信息正被投射到太空之中。你们的信息很容易获取。他们不需要来这里研究你们。而且，他们为什么要研究你们呢？</p>
<p>Why would so much time and effort be spent in studying human beings? Do you think this is a science project? Do you think this is a cultural exploration? Do people think that humanity is so fascinating, so marvelous and so remarkable that other races would spend this kind of time studying you?</p>
<p>为什么要花如此多的时间和精力去研究人类？你认为这是一个科学项目吗？你认为这是一次文化探索吗？人们会认为人类如此迷人、如此神奇、如此非凡，以至于其他种族会花如此多的时间来研究你们吗？</p>
<p>The only reason that races are studied is for economic or political advantage in the Greater Community. And these races are studied without their permission. Would you want someone to say, “We would like to study you. Would you be our laboratory experiment for the rest of your life? We will try not to harm you.”</p>
<p>研究种族的唯一目的是为了在大社区中获取经济或政治利益。而且这些种族未经其本人许可就被研究了。你想听到有人说：“我们想研究你。你愿意一辈子都做我们的实验品吗？我们会尽量不伤害你的。”</p>
<p>Would you agree to that? Especially if you found out that you were being used in order for your investigators to take advantage of everything you are and everything you have? Many people think, “Well, the visitors are here to help us,” but really they are here to help themselves. And people are making it very easy for them to do this.</p>
<p>你会同意吗？尤其是当你发现你被调查人员利用，好让他们利用你的一切——包括你的一切——的时候。很多人会想：“嗯，探访者来这里是为了帮助我们”，但实际上他们来这里是为了自救。而人们正在为他们提供便利，让他们轻易地做到这一点。</p>
<p>So you might ask, “Well, why aren’t more people aware of this?” The answer to that is difficult because it deals with several different factors. The first is people’s cultural conditioning and religious conditioning that really do not allow for the reality of intelligent life in the universe, regardless of their perhaps liberal views on the subject.</p>
<p>所以你可能会问：“为什么没有更多人察觉到这一点？”这个问题很难回答，因为它涉及到几个不同的因素。首先是人们的文化和宗教背景，无论他们对这个问题的看法多么自由，这些背景都不允许宇宙中存在智能生命。</p>
<p>When it comes right down to it, there is no place in human awareness for life in the universe, unless it is at the level of a primitive life form, of course. A piece of bacteria is fine. An intelligent race intervening in human affairs is not fine.</p>
<p>说到底，人类觉知中没有宇宙生命存在的空间，除非它处于原始生命形态的层面。一个细菌还好。一个智能种族干预人类事务就不好了。</p>
<p>The governments of the world will not reveal what they know because they have no defense. And the defenses they do have they cannot fully employ without notifying the public. And they do not trust the public, their own populations, to support such an effort without going into panic. Would the government of your country publicly announce, “We have an Intervention going on from races beyond the world. We don’t really understand their technology. We are not sure of all of their activities. And we have no defense against them”?</p>
<p>世界各国政府不愿透露他们所知，因为他们缺乏防御手段。而他们现有的防御手段，如果不告知公众，也无法充分运用。他们不相信公众，不相信他们自己的人民，会在不陷入恐慌的情况下支持这样的行动。你们国家的政府会公开宣布：“我们正遭受来自地球以外种族的干预。我们并不真正理解他们的科技。我们不确定他们的所有活动。而且我们对他们毫无防御手段。”</p>
<p>People think they should be told, but most people could not handle it. They could not take it in. They would run and try to hide somewhere. They would think the end of the world was at hand.</p>
<p>人们认为他们应该被告知，但大多数人都无法接受。他们无法接受。他们会逃跑，试图躲在某个地方。他们会认为世界末日即将来临。</p>
<p>There are people who are aware of the Intervention but say, “Well, we must be very careful not to come to any premature conclusions here. I mean, we have to gather more facts. We need more evidence.”</p>
<p>有些人察觉到干预的存在，但他们说：“好吧，我们必须非常小心，不要得出任何过早的结论。我的意思是，我们必须收集更多事实。我们需要更多证据。”</p>
<p>Really? For what? Can’t you just see this and know this for what it is? Are you going to spend the rest of your life piecing it together in little tiny pieces? This is not a science experiment. This is the interaction between life forms.</p>
<p>真的吗？为了什么？难道你就不能亲眼看到它，知道它的本质吗？难道你要用余生去把它一点一点地拼凑起来吗？这不是科学实验。这是生命形式之间的相互作用。</p>
<p>If you were diagnosed with a serious illness, would you want to become part of a laboratory experiment? Or would you want to get cured? You would likely want a path of healing established as soon as possible, and if you were sincere about relieving yourself of your illness, you would give it all of your attention. But certain people treat the Intervention as if it were a science experiment, and they are going to take a very long time and piece it all together, and they do not want to be wrong.</p>
<p>如果你被诊断出患有重病，你会想成为实验室实验的一部分吗？还是你想被治愈？你很可能希望尽快找到一条治愈之路，如果你真心想摆脱疾病，你会全神贯注地投入其中。但有些人把干预当成一场科学实验，他们会花很长时间把所有事情拼凑起来，而且他们不想出错。</p>
<p>Meanwhile, their world is being undermined right underneath their feet. They do not know it, and they do not see it, and they do not want to come to these conclusions because they seem unscientific, and they seem outrageous, and where is the proof? And what is proof?</p>
<p>与此同时，他们的世界正在脚下遭受破坏。他们对此一无所知，他们也看不到，他们也不愿得出这些结论，因为这些结论似乎不科学，甚至荒谬至极。证据又在哪里呢？证据又是什么呢？</p>
<p>How much do you have to see before it is clear? Given the clandestine nature of the Intervention, well, not much is being shown to people. Not in broad daylight anyway.</p>
<p>你需要看到多少才能真相大白？鉴于干预的秘密性质，嗯，不会向人们展示太多。至少不会在光天化日之下。</p>
<p>So attempting to be scientific, you piece it together, and you are on the path of seeking the truth, and you don’t get the truth, and you haven’t gotten the truth, and you won’t get the truth. And you are ambivalent about getting the truth because if you really see what it is, well, your science experiment is over. And now you must really act. You must really do something.</p>
<p>所以，为了科学起见，你把所有东西拼凑起来，踏上了寻求真理的道路，但你没有得到真理，你还没有得到真理，你也永远不会得到真理。你对得到真理感到矛盾，因为如果你真的看到了它是什么，那么你的科学实验就结束了。现在你必须真正行动起来。你必须真正做点什么。</p>
<p>And your colleagues will look at you like you are crazy, like you have lost your mind, like you have given up your reason and objectivity and taken a wild and outrageous position. So as much as the truth is sought, at least in theory, it is denied, and no one wants to take the risk of knowing anything. This is a very hard thing to come to terms with, by the way. We understand this. This may be the hardest thing you have ever come to terms with, other than your own mortality.</p>
<p>你的同事会把你看作疯子，看作失去了理智，看作放弃了理性和客观性，采取了疯狂离谱的立场。所以，尽管人们追寻真相，至少在理论上，真相却被否定，没有人愿意冒险去知道任何事情。顺便说一句，这是一件很难接受的事情。我们理解这一点。这可能是你经历过的最难接受的事情，除了你自身的死亡。</p>
<p>We do not expect people to simply accept this at first notice. But we must address those tendencies, beliefs and attitudes that prevent people from knowing this at any time. You do not want to wait for the proof because then it will be too late. By then, there will be very little recourse.</p>
<p>我们并不指望人们一听到就轻易接受这一点。但我们必须解决那些阻碍人们随时知道这一点的倾向、信念和态度。你不想等到证据出来才去发现，因为那样就太晚了。到那时，就几乎无计可施了。</p>
<p>Then people will say, “Well, the visitors have really taken over everything now. I guess it means that’s why they’re here!” And what do you do then? Protest? Write letters to your senator? Complain to your friends?</p>
<p>然后人们会说：“好吧，现在来访者真的接管了一切。我猜这就是他们来这里的原因！”那时你会怎么做？抗议？给你的参议员写信？向你的朋友抱怨？</p>
<p>This is a very serious situation. People must take risks here to see and to know. But even in taking risks, you need some help because you cannot see what is beyond your borders.</p>
<p>形势非常严峻。人们必须冒险才能看见、知道情况。但即使冒险，你也需要帮助，因为你无法看到边界之外的情况。</p>
<p>Could the Native American peoples understand the intricacies and competition between European nations? No, they could not. Not without help from a more mysterious source. And indeed at that time, the Angelic Presence was active in trying to notify the peoples of the Americas that great and tragic changes were coming.</p>
<p>美洲原住民能理解欧洲国家之间错综复杂的关系和竞争吗？不，他们无法理解。除非得到一个更神秘的来源的帮助。事实上，当时天使的存在正在积极地试图通知美洲人民，巨大而悲惨的变革即将到来。</p>
<p>But like yourselves, the Natives could not respond because it was outside the realm of their world view. It did not fit with their beliefs or understanding, and so such revelations, to the extent they could be made available to people, were largely rejected or ignored. Do you think that the Angelic Presence just looked the other way and let the Native American peoples be obliterated?</p>
<p>但和你们一样，原住民无法回应，因为这超出了他们的世界观。这不符合他们的信仰或理解，所以这些启示，即便能够被人们知晓，也大多被拒绝或忽视。你认为天使的存在只是视而不见，任由美洲原住民被消灭吗？</p>
<p>People want things to work out well. They want to be comfortable. And so they do not look, and if they look, they do not see, and if they see, they do not comprehend because of what they want. People do not want war, and, as a result, they deny war until war overtakes them.</p>
<p>人们希望事情进展顺利。他们想要舒适的生活。所以他们不去看，即使去看，他们也看不见；即使看见了，他们也不会明白，因为他们有想要的东西。人们不想要战争，因此，他们拒绝战争，直到战争降临到他们头上。</p>
<p>Instead of eradicating the conflict at the very outset, as soon as the spark is lit, they wait for the fire to reach them, and then they say, “Oh, we have to stop this!”</p>
<p>他们不是从一开始就消除冲突，而是在火花点燃之后，等待火势蔓延到他们身上，然后才说：“哦，我们必须阻止这一切！”</p>
<p>People ask, “Well, what can we really do?” There is a great deal you can really do. You must begin with awareness. You must have an understanding of what you are dealing with. You must not allow any alien force to set foot on the soil of this world without the express permission from the people of your world. You have these rights. You must exercise them.</p>
<p>人们问：“好吧，我们究竟能做什么？”你们确实可以做很多事情。你们必须从觉知开始。你们必须理解你们正在应对的是什么。你们绝不能允许任何外星势力在没有得到你们世界人民明确许可的情况下踏上这个世界的土地。你们拥有这些权利。你们必须行使它们。</p>
<p>Here it is necessary to take a very prosaic view of life in the universe. Look up at the stars. They are physical. This is not the Heavens you are looking at. This is not your heavenly state.</p>
<p>在这里，有必要以一种非常平凡的视角来看待宇宙生命。仰望星空。它们是物质的。这不是你正在凝视的天堂。这不是你的天堂状态。</p>
<p>Everyone in the universe, living in physical life, must deal with the rigors of physical life—survival, competition, hardship, deprivation. Technology does not end these requirements and these difficulties. In fact, it can make things even more complicated. It solves some problems and creates others.</p>
<p>宇宙中每一个活在物质世界中的生命，都必须应对物质生命的种种挑战——生存、竞争、艰辛、匮乏。科技并不能终结这些需求和困境。事实上，它反而会让事情变得更加复杂。它解决了一些问题，也制造了新的问题。</p>
<p>You must have an adult view of life in the universe. If you have an adolescent view, you are not going to understand. And your lack of comprehension could truly be tragic. The awareness must be established.</p>
<p>你必须以成年人的视角看待宇宙中的生命。如果你的视角是青少年的，你就不会理解。而你的理解力不足可能真的会很悲惨。这种觉知必须建立起来。</p>
<p>This is the purpose of The Allies Briefings—to establish the awareness, not to answer every question, not to give you a complete understanding, but to give you an awareness. Gaining an awareness is being alerted to something. It does not mean all your questions regarding it are answered or even addressed. But it does mean you are aware of something.</p>
<p>这就是盟友简报的目的——建立觉知，并非解答所有问题，并非让你完全理解，而是让你获得一种觉知。获得觉知意味着对某事有所警觉。这并不意味着你所有关于它的问题都得到了解答，甚至得到了解决。但它确实意味着你察觉到了某事。</p>
<p>The Allies’ message is very simple and very short, and in many ways very general because it is here to arouse awareness and to correct misunderstanding. That is its purpose. Beyond this awareness, there must be a development in spiritual understanding, an awareness of the mental environment and the willingness to establish greater cooperation between nations and cultures.</p>
<p>盟友的讯息非常简单、非常简短，而且在许多方面非常笼统，因为它在这里是为了唤起人们的觉知和纠正误解。这就是它的目的。除了这种觉知之外，还必须发展精神层面的理解，一种心理环境的觉知，并愿意在国家和文化之间建立更伟大的意愿。</p>
<p>This is a worldwide problem. It is not a problem for Americans or British or Chinese. It is a worldwide phenomenon. The Intervention does not prize one race over another, except insofar as one race can help achieve the intentions of those who are intervening. In this, there is much emphasis on America because it is the most powerful, influential nation. But this is a worldwide phenomenon.</p>
<p>这是一个世界性的问题。它不是美国人、英国人或中国人的问题。这是一个世界性现象。干预不会优待某个人种，除非某个人种能够帮助实现干预者的意图。在这方面，美国被高度重视，因为它是最强大、最具影响力的国家。但这是一个世界性现象。</p>
<p>You as human beings are being challenged. Your right to be here, your right to be free and self-determined in the universe, is being challenged. Those who are intervening in human affairs believe that you cannot rule yourselves and that you will destroy the world, and so they feel that it is their right and privilege to intervene. Their attitude is, “Well, these human beings! Look at them! They are like animals! We will bring order and structure here.” And some people will think, “Oh, that is wonderful! Finally, we will have order and structure.”</p>
<p>你们人类正在遭受挑战。你们在此生存的权利，你们在宇宙中自由自决的权利，正在遭受挑战。那些干预人类事务的种族认为，你们无法统治你们自己，你们会毁灭世界，所以他们觉得干预是他们的权利和特权。他们的态度是：“好吧，这些人！看看他们！他们就像动物一样！我们要在这里带来秩序和结构。”有些人会想：“哦，那太好了！我们终于要拥有秩序和结构了。”</p>
<p>Do you really want order and structure imposed upon you in this way and to this degree? This is not the way that humanity will advance or become elevated. This is not the way humanity will establish cooperation and peace within the world. Do you want to be occupied? Because that is what you are facing. A vast, global occupation.</p>
<p>你们真的想要以这种方式、在这种程度上被强加于你们的秩序和结构吗？这并非人类进步或提升的途径。这并非人类在世界范围内建立合作与和平的途径。你们想要被占领吗？因为这就是你们所面对的。一场浩瀚的、全球性的占领。</p>
<p>Many people will say, “Well, I just can’t deal with this. I have other problems.” We say, “What other problems do you have that are more important than this?” Yes, there are other things in everyone’s life that must be dealt with and resolved, but not at the expense of this awareness. This is the most important awareness that one can have in life, in this world, at this time.</p>
<p>很多人会说：“嗯，我实在处理不了这个问题。我还有其他问题。”我们会说：“你还有什么比这更重要的问题吗？”是的，每个人的生命中都有其他事情需要处理和解决，但不能以牺牲这种觉知为代价。这是人生中、在这个世界上、在这个时代所能拥有的最重要的觉知。</p>
<p>So you begin with awareness, and then you must study and learn things about life in the universe. And where can you learn this? At the university? In church? From your parents? From your friends? From the newspaper? Or a magazine?</p>
<p>所以，你首先要有觉知，然后你必须学习和了解宇宙中的生命。你在哪里可以学到这些？在大学？在教堂？从父母那里？从朋友那里？从报纸上？还是从杂志上？</p>
<p>What teaches you about life in the universe can be learned in part from human history. The understanding of how the world has evolved, and the forces that have shaped it, and how nations have interacted with each other will teach you a great deal about life in the universe because it is not different. It is only happening on a much greater scale with many more different influences and participants.</p>
<p>人类的历史可以部分地帮助你了解宇宙中的生命。理解世界如何演化，塑造它的驱动力，以及各国如何互动，将使你对宇宙中的生命有更深刻的理解，因为宇宙并没有什么不同。只是宇宙的规模更大，影响因素和参与者也更多。</p>
<p>You need a very sober view of intelligent life in the universe. And you must understand, counter to what is believed by many today, that technology will not save you. It will only change you. Technology has not saved any race in the universe. It has only changed them.</p>
<p>你需要对宇宙中的智能生命有一个非常清醒的认识。你必须理解，与当今许多人所相信的相反，科技不会拯救你们，它只会改变你们。科技从未拯救过宇宙中的任何种族，它只是改变了他们。</p>
<p>Yes, there are nations that can overwhelm and dominate others because of technology. But these invading nations have been changed themselves by technology. Technology actually makes you vulnerable in the Greater Community. If you have technology that no one else has, well, everyone wants what you have now.</p>
<p>是的，有些国家能够凭借科技压倒并主宰其他国家。但这些入侵国家本身也被科技改变了。科技实际上让你们在大社区中变得脆弱。如果你们拥有其他种族没有的科技，那么每个种族都会觊觎你们现在所拥有的技术。</p>
<p>And how are you going to defend what you have and protect what you have? It is a problem that very wealthy people face even in your world. How are they going to protect their wealth and their privilege? This totally changes their lives, their friends, their priorities, and can indeed make their lives truly miserable, and often does.</p>
<p>你要如何捍卫你所拥有的，保护你所拥有的一切？即使在你们的世界里，这也是非常富有的人面临的问题。他们该如何保护他们的财富和特权？这彻底改变了他们的生命、他们的朋友、他们的优先事项，甚至可能让他们的生命变得非常痛苦，而且这种情况经常发生。</p>
<p>The best position in the Greater Community is to be self-sufficient, independent and extremely discreet. This is wisdom on a greater scale. Yet you can understand from human culture and your own history how this can be true and why this is true. Does the person who just won a million dollars go out and tell everybody? Well, things will change if they do. Discretion, discernment. Very important. More important now than ever before.</p>
<p>在大社区中，最好的状态是自给自足、独立自主，并且极其谨慎。这就是更大范围内的智慧。然而，你可以从人类文化和自身历史中理解这一点如何成为现实，以及为什么如此。一个刚刚赢得一百万美元的人会去告诉所有人吗？嗯，如果他们这么做，情况就会改变。谨慎，辨别力。非常重要。现在比以往任何时候都更加重要。</p>
<p>Therefore, a great deal can be learned from your own history. You take an objective view and say, “Well, this is what happens when nations of different capabilities interact.”</p>
<p>因此，你可以从你们自身的历史中学到很多事情。你可以客观地看待这个问题，然后说：“嗯，这就是不同能力的国家互动时会发生的情况。”</p>
<p>Yet many people still think, “It’s manifest destiny. It must be this way. It’s the way it is. And it can’t be changed. And it would have happened this way anyway.” That is ridiculous. It could have happened in many different ways. It could have gone many different ways. History did not have to turn out the way it did. And there are other people in the world who think, “Well, whatever happens is the right thing to happen.” This is even more ridiculous.</p>
<p>然而，很多人仍然认为：“这是天命所归。它必然如此。它就是这样。它无法改变。无论如何它都会这样发生。”这太荒谬了。它本可以以许多不同的方式发生。它本可以走向许多不同的结局。历史本不该如此发展。世界上还有一些人认为：“好吧，无论发生什么，都是正确的。” 这更是荒谬的。</p>
<p>Yet while much may be learned by studying human history, culture and psychology, there must be new information as well, a new perspective. It is not simply new information you need as much as a larger perspective.</p>
<p>然而，虽然研究人类历史、文化和心理学可以学到很多东西，但也必须有新的信息和新的视角。你需要的不仅仅是新的信息，更需要一种更广阔的视野。</p>
<p>If you look at things the way you have always looked at them, you are going to see what you have always seen. And nothing new is going to be revealed. So to have a new understanding, a new revelation, requires a different perspective. Otherwise, the mind simply protects what it already believes in and fends off or fights off anything that challenges that.</p>
<p>如果你用一贯的眼光看待事物，你看到的终究还是老样子。不会有任何新的发现。所以，要获得一种新的理解，新的启示，需要不同的视角。否则，你的心灵只会保护它所相信的，并抵御或抗拒任何挑战它的事情。</p>
<p>A new spiritual perspective and an understanding of spirituality in the universe is being provided through the Teaching in Greater Community Spirituality. Instead of receiving this gift from the Creator, some people may say, “Well, this is all coming from one person. He is going to become so rich and powerful!”</p>
<p>大社区精神性教导正在提供一种新的精神视角，以及对宇宙精神性的理解。有些人或许不会接受这份来自造物主的礼物，反而会说：“嗯，这都来自一个人。他会变得多么富有和强大！”</p>
<p>Ha! We hope he does not get destroyed, actually. Is it a blessing to have all of this given through you into the world? Is it really a blessing to be maligned and condemned or even deified by people? We think it is a great burden and a great sacrifice to accept such a responsibility. The best thing you can hope for is anonymity, but you will not have it because sooner or later people will find out.</p>
<p>哈！其实，我们希望他不会被毁灭。让这一切通过你流传于世，是一种祝福吗？被人们诋毁、谴责，甚至神化，真的是一种祝福吗？我们认为承担这样的责任是沉重的负担，也是巨大的牺牲。你所能期待的最好结果就是默默无闻，但你不会拥有它，因为迟早会被人发现。</p>
<p>“Well, this person really says that he has something that no one else has,” and then everyone goes crazy about it. “How can someone say this! Who does he think he is! He must be cavorting with the devil! And if he is cavorting with the Angels, well, why does he get to be the one and not me?” You see, it is hard to be a Messenger.</p>
<p>“好吧，这人居然说他拥有别人没有的东西，”然后每个人都为之疯狂。“怎么会有人这么说！他以为他是谁？他肯定在跟魔鬼鬼混！如果他和天使在一起，那为什么是他而不是我呢？”你看，做一位信使真的不容易。</p>
<p>Yet someone has to do it. And a person needs great assistance or it cannot be done. They must have great self-trust, great confidence in the Creator and great discernment to tell whether they are being correctly or incorrectly guided. Certainly, anyone who is protecting their money or their social standing could not be in such a position without great personal conflict.</p>
<p>然而，必须有人去做。一个人需要伟大的援助，否则就无法做到。他们必须拥有伟大的自我信任，对造物主拥有伟大的信心，并拥有伟大的辨别力，才能分辨出自己受到的引导是正确还是错误。当然，任何一个想要保护他们金钱或社会地位的人，如果没有巨大的个人冲突，就不可能处于这样的位置。</p>
<p>Therefore, new information is needed here, a new perspective, a Greater Community perspective. You have to start thinking like someone who lives in a Greater Community and not simply someone who lives in a neighborhood or a town.</p>
<p>因此，这里需要新的信息，新的视角，一个大社区的视角。你必须开始像一个生活在大社区里的人一样思考，而不是仅仅像一个社区或城镇里的人一样思考。</p>
<p>Perspective can be learned. And when you gain a new perspective, particularly a greater perspective like this, well, you can see and know things that simply were not obvious before. And these things will not be based upon speculation but upon clear observation.</p>
<p>视角是可以习得的。当你获得新的视角，尤其是像这样一种更伟大的视角时，你就能看到并知道一些以前根本不明显的事情。而这些并非基于推测，而是基于清晰的洞察。</p>
<p>At some point, you will say, “Well, of course no one should be visiting us without our permission!” That becomes obvious. Right now, people never even think to ask that question. “Well, I don’t know….”</p>
<p>有时候，你会说：“当然，没有人应该未经我们允许就来拜访我们！”这显而易见。现在，人们甚至都不会问这个问题。“好吧，我不知道……”</p>
<p>At some point, you become aware that spiritually advanced races do not go around intervening in other people’s worlds. They may send messages through observers, like the Allies of Humanity, but they do not intervene. The spiritually advanced in the universe do not do that, regardless of their cultures, their worlds, their temperaments or their natures because this is wisdom and wisdom is universal.</p>
<p>到了某个时刻，你会察觉到，精神上先进的种族不会四处干预他人的世界。他们或许会通过观察者传递讯息，比如人类盟友，但他们不会干预。宇宙中精神上先进的种族不会这样做，无论他们的文化、他们的世界、他们的性情或他们的自然如何，因为这是智慧，而智慧是普世的。</p>
<p>So just because someone can fly in a spacecraft and get here quickly, relatively speaking, to think that they are spiritually advanced, well, that is ignorance. So when you gain a Greater Community perspective, you realize that the wise do not intervene. The wise do not come here and change everything.</p>
<p>因此，仅仅因为某个生命能乘坐宇宙飞船快速抵达这里，相对而言就认为他们是精神上先进的，好吧，这其实是无知。所以，当你拥有大社区的视角时，你就会意识到，智者不会干预。智者不会来到这里改变一切。</p>
<p>There are circumstances where genetic material will be given to an evolving race, but that is not what is occurring in the world at this time, we can assure you. Humanity has everything it needs to be successful. It does not need advanced technology. It does not need alien genetic material. Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is either part of the Intervention or is unwittingly supporting it.</p>
<p>在某些情况下，基因物质会被赋予一个进化的种族，但我们可以向你保证，这并非当今世界正在发生的事情。人类拥有成功所需的一切。它不需要先进的科技。它不需要外星基因物质。任何试图告诉你们其他情况的人，要么是干预的一部分，要么是在不知不觉中支持它。</p>
<p>Humanity needs a new perspective. But within you, and within the human race, is the seed of Knowledge, your spiritual Mind. This Knowledge is ancient and has been with you all along. If you can discover it, it will reveal to you what you need to know and what you need to do.</p>
<p>人类需要一个新的视角。但在你们之内，在人类之内，蕴藏着内识的种子，你们的精神心灵。这内识古老而悠久，一直伴随着你们。如果你能发现它，它将揭示你需要知道什么，需要做什么。</p>
<p>Everyone who is born into the world today is born with the potential for understanding the Greater Community because this is the time when humanity gains contact with life in the universe, which we call the Greater Community. This understanding is in you already.</p>
<p>当今世界出生的每个人，都生来就拥有理解大社区的潜力，因为这是人类与宇宙生命——我们称之为大社区——接触的时代。这份理解早已存在于你们心中。</p>
<p>If any alien race tells you, “Well, we are here to enhance your genetic code,” you must not believe this. It is not true. If you really want to be a laboratory animal, if you really want to be subjected to an occupation, if you think this is what it means to have contact with life in the universe, then what is going to change your mind? Experiencing the occupation? Waking up one day and saying, “My God! I am no longer a free person and I have no recourse”?</p>
<p>如果任何外星种族告诉你：“好吧，我们来这里是为了增强你们的基因密码”，你一定不要相信。这不是真的。如果你真的想成为实验动物，如果你真的想被占领，如果你认为这就是与宇宙生命接触的意义，那么什么能改变你的想法呢？是经历占领吗？还是有一天醒来说：“我的天哪！我不再是一个自由人了，我已经无路可走”？</p>
<p>Is it too audacious to say that this is the most important problem in the world and that God has given an answer and the answer has been given in a Teaching? Is it too audacious to say that this is the most important problem in the world and God has given an answer, and the answer is being given through one person? How else would the answer be given? Would it be given to a hundred people? The message would never get beyond them if it did.</p>
<p>说这是世界上最重要的问题，上帝已经给出了答案，而这个答案就在教导之中，这是否太过大胆？说这是世上最重要的问题，上帝已经给出了答案，而这个答案是通过一个人给出的，这是否太过大胆？否则答案又如何给出呢？答案会传达给一百个人吗？如果答案真的如此，讯息就永远无法传达到他们之外。</p>
<p>When Jesus came, were there a hundred Jesuses, all competing with each other? “Well, my Jesus is the real Jesus, but yours is not!” That is not how Revelation is brought to the world because it does not work.</p>
<p>耶稣降临的时候，是不是有一百个耶稣，都在互相竞争？“好吧，我的耶稣是真正的耶稣，但你的不是！”启示不是这样带给世人的，因为这样行不通。</p>
<p>We are beyond the world. We are the Angels. So we can say audacious things and then go somewhere else. We do not have to deal with the repercussions. We just deliver the message and people either go crazy with it or they become illuminated by it. But we are somewhere else. It does not affect us.</p>
<p>我们超越世界。我们是天使。所以我们可以大胆地说出一些话，然后去往别处。我们无需承担后果。我们只是传递讯息，人们要么为之疯狂，要么被它照亮。但我们身处别处。它不会影响我们。</p>
<p>However, for the Messenger, it is another story. He has to face all of the reaction that will occur. It is not an easy job. Be glad that you are not given this job. But understand that as your realization occurs, you will have to advocate for this awareness too. You will not have the difficulty that the Messenger has, but you will face all the things that we are talking about.</p>
<p>然而，对于信使来说，情况就不同了。他必须面对所有可能产生的反应。这不是一件容易的事。庆幸你没有被赋予这份工作。但要理解，随着你领会到这一点时，你也必须倡导这种觉知。你不会遇到信使那样的困难，但你会面对我们所说的所有事情。</p>
<p>You will see the effects of the Intervention. You will see the effects of the Pacification Program. You will see how listless people are, how critical they are and how much they are in denial. And all of their outrage and all of their suspicion and all of their fear and all of their avoidance, you will see. It will be as clear as day. And you will understand then how Revelation occurs in the world. When the Message has to be given and time is of the essence, this is how it occurs. This is the difficulty. This is the challenge.</p>
<p>你将看到干预的效应。你将看到安抚计划的影响。你将看到人们多么无精打采，多么挑剔，多么否认。你会看到他们所有的愤怒、所有的怀疑、所有的恐惧和所有的回避。这将清晰如白昼。那时你将理解启示如何在世界上发生。当讯息必须被赋予，时间至关重要时，它就是这样发生的。这就是困难。这就是挑战。</p>
<p>The real problem ultimately is not with the Intervention, though that is a real problem. The bigger problem is human response-ability. The ability of people to respond. The lack of response. The ignorant response. The negative response. If people cannot respond, well, the world will be given away.</p>
<p>真正的问题最终不在于干预，尽管那是一个真正的问题。更大的问题是人类的回应能力。人们回应的能力。缺乏回应。无知的回应。负面的回应。如果人们无法回应，好吧，世界将被拱手相让。</p>
<p>There are not many visitors here in the world. Their numbers are not that great. But their job is being made easy because of human acquiescence and human ignorance. Again, the response. The ability to respond. Response-ability.</p>
<p>世界上的来访者并不多，数量也不算多。但由于人类的默许和无知，他们的工作变得异常轻松。再次强调，回应。回应的能力。回应能力。</p>
<p>If there is no response-ability, well, people will not respond, and the occupation will happen, right beneath their feet. And people will think, “Oh, well, something is going on in the world. Things certainly are changing!” And it will seem to be okay until they find out what it really is.</p>
<p>如果没有回应能力，好吧，人们就不会做出回应，占领就会发生在他们脚下。人们会想：“哦，好吧，世界上肯定出了什么事。事情肯定在改变！”看起来一切都好，直到他们发现真相为止。</p>
<p>That is why at this time an urgent Message is being delivered. The awareness is the first thing. Then you must learn about life in the Greater Community, which you can begin to do by looking at your own world objectively. Then you must begin to gain a Greater Community perspective and learn about life and spirituality in the universe.</p>
<p>正因如此，此刻一条紧急的讯息正在被传递。觉知是首要之事。然后，你必须学习关于大社区的生命，而这可以通过客观地审视你自己的世界来开始。然后，你必须开始获得一种大社区的视角，并学习关于宇宙中的生命和精神性。</p>
<p>This is now being presented in the Teaching on Greater Community Spirituality. Not everyone will be able to learn this Teaching, but enough people in many places will need access to it in order to comprehend what is going on.</p>
<p>这正在大社区精神性教导中呈现。并非每个人都能学习这个教导，但许多地方有足够多的人需要接触它，才能理解正在发生的事情。</p>
<p>Humanity could end the Intervention tomorrow if it were informed and aware. Humanity could prevent a future Intervention of this kind if it were informed and aware and united. People are so preoccupied with themselves that their borders are undefended.</p>
<p>如果人类知情且有所察觉，明天就能终止干预。如果人类知情且有所察觉并团结一致，就能阻止未来此类干预。人们如此专注于自身，以至于他们的边界没有设防。</p>
<p>Oh, yes, they have borders, between each other, tremendous borders, walls and resistance and hostility. But your borders to space are undefended. You have no walls to prevent the outside from coming in because you do not think there is an outside that can come in or that will come in.</p>
<p>哦，是的，它们之间有边界，极大的边界，高墙，还有抵抗和敌意。但你们与太空的边界却没有防御。你们没有墙来阻止外界入侵，因为你们认为不存在任何外界能够入侵或将会入侵。</p>
<p>This, then, is a time for courage, trust and honesty. Time for a real reckoning within yourself. Read The Allies Briefings and ask yourself: “What do I really know?” not “What do I want?” or “What do I prefer?” or “What do I believe?” but “What do I really know here? Is this really happening?”</p>
<p>那么，现在正是展现勇气、信任和诚实的时刻。是时候真正反思一下你自己了。阅读盟友的简报，问问你自己：“我真正知道什么？”不是“我想要什么？” 也不是“我的偏好是什么？” 也不是“我相信什么？” 而是“我真正知道什么？这真的发生了吗？”</p>
<p>Consult Knowledge within yourself if you can, not your ideas or your fears or your beliefs, but something deeper within you. That is where the real confirmation will happen.</p>
<p>如果可以的话，请咨询你自己内在的内识，不是你的想法、你的恐惧或你的信仰，而是你内在更深层次的内识。真正的确认将会发生在那里。</p>
<p>It will take great courage to ask this because this awareness will change your life. It will set you free. And it will give you direction. But you must be willing to have this change within yourself. This is the revelation that happens within each person. It is much resisted. Much delayed. But if it can take place, it is the most valuable thing.</p>
<p>提出这个问题需要伟大的勇气，因为这种觉知将改变你的生命。它将赋予你自由，并指引你的方向。但你必须愿意在你自己的内在发生这种改变。这是每个人内心都会发生的启示。它常常受到阻碍，常常被拖延。但如果它能够发生，它将是最宝贵的。</p>
<p>We send our blessings to you and ask that you receive this counsel and consider it for yourself, for you must make the ultimate decision. We can only inform. We cannot control. The Presence of the Teachers is with you.</p>
<p>我们向你致以祝福，并要求你接受这份忠告，并为你自己思考它，因为最终的决定权在你手中。我们只能提供信息，我们无法掌控。老师们的存在与你同在。</p>
