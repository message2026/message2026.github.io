<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on February 23, 2000 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2000 年 2 月 23 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is easy to ask questions. It is more difficult to find the real answers. People are hungry for answers, but they do not have the awareness yet. So when considering the message in The Allies Briefings, people must begin to develop a Greater Community awareness and sensitivity.</p>
<p>提出问题很容易，找到真正的答案却更难。人们渴望答案，但他们尚未具备觉知。因此，在思考盟友简报中的讯息时，人们必须开始培养大社区的觉知和敏感度。</p>
<p>Just getting answers to questions does not develop this awareness or sensitivity. And, indeed, even if you have the right answer, if you cannot experience it, if you cannot recognize it, if you cannot see its application, well, what good is it? It is lost on the person who is asking.</p>
<p>仅仅得到问题的答案并不能培养这种觉知或敏感度。事实上，即使你有正确的答案，如果你无法体验它，无法识别它，无法理解它的应用，那它还有什么用呢？提问者自己也感觉不到。</p>
<p>Therefore, it always comes back to developing the awareness and sensitivity and the ability to know. People want proof, and so they go to whoever they think is the expert, and the expert gives their opinions, and people say, “Ah! This must be the proof because the expert said so.” But it is all opinions.</p>
<p>因此，最终归根结底还是要培养觉知、敏感度和求知能力。人们想要证据，所以会去找他们认为的专家，听专家给出意见，然后人们会说：“啊！这肯定是证据，因为专家这么说过。” 但这都只是观点而已。</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, everything is just opinions in the mind. And these opinions are developed by people’s conditioning, by their attitudes and by their temperament. People can experience something and make conclusions and evaluations but be completely wrong in their estimation.</p>
<p>没有内识，一切都只是心灵中的观点。而这些观点是由人们的条件、态度和性情所发展出来的。人们可以体验某些事物，并得出结论和评估，但他们的评估可能完全错误。</p>
<p>However, we are talking about higher consciousness here. We are not talking about having answers. Answers, without this higher consciousness, will not be enough, and their application will not be understood. Ultimately, you must gain this higher consciousness.</p>
<p>然而，我们这里谈论的是更高的意识。我们谈论的不是拥有答案。没有这种更高的意识，答案是不够的，答案的应用也无法被理解。最终，你必须获得这种更高的意识。</p>
<p>This consciousness transcends human culture, human conditioning and even your biological identity. It is an awareness of life as it is moving all around you and through everything else. You need this higher consciousness to understand the plants and the animals, the weather and the movement of the world. You need this to understand the presence of negative forces in the mental environment and the presence of the Angelic Forces, which are here to serve you.</p>
<p>这种意识超越了人类的文化、人类的制约，甚至你的生物身份。它是一种对生命在你周围以及贯穿一切事物的觉知。你需要这种更高的意识来理解动植物、气候以及世界的运动。你需要它来理解心理环境中负面力量的存在，以及天使力量的存在，它们在此为你服务。</p>
<p>And certainly, you must have this consciousness to be aware of the Greater Community forces in the world, to recognize their manifestations, their intentions and their methods. You need this higher awareness to tell friend from foe.</p>
<p>当然，你必须拥有这种意识，才能觉察世界上的大社区势力，才能认出它们的表现形式、意图和手段。你需要这种更高的觉知来区分敌友。</p>
<p>So when people ask a lot of questions, the real answer is the development of higher consciousness. This leads you into the mystery, where you may not be willing to go, but this is where you must go if you are going to understand.</p>
<p>所以，当人们提出很多问题时，真正的答案是更高意识的发展。这会引领你进入一个你或许不愿涉足的神秘，但如果你想理解，这是你必须踏足的领域。</p>
<p>This is the mystery of your life—the mystery of what you know, the mystery of who you are, the mystery of why you are here and the mystery of what you must respond to. You are not here simply to fill your mind with more answers that cannot be recognized or understood.</p>
<p>这是你生命的神秘——你所知道什么的神秘，你是谁的神秘，你为何在此的神秘，以及你必须回应什么的神秘。你在此并非只是为了用更多无法被认知或理解的答案来填充你的心灵。</p>
<p>This, then, moves things in the right direction. Yet of course there are people who cannot tolerate the mystery and must have answers, thinking answers will resolve their inquiry. These people will constitute the majority of people who inquire about The Allies Briefings and who will question you about it. You, personally, cannot answer all the questions there are about the Allies—who they are, where they come from, how they got here, their method of propulsion, where they are hiding and how they communicate. How can you possibly answer all these questions?</p>
<p>这才让事情朝着正确的方向发展。然而，当然有些人无法忍受神秘，他们必须找到答案，认为答案就能解决他们的疑问。这些人构成了询问盟友简报以及向你提问的大多数人。你个人无法回答所有关于盟友的问题——他们是谁，他们来自哪里，他们是如何到达这里的，他们的推进方式，他们藏身何处以及他们如何沟通。你怎么可能回答所有这些问题？</p>
<p>However, you can be aware of the Allies, and you have the ability to recognize the validity of their message. You have learned enough about life and about nature to understand their point of view and what they emphasize and why it is necessary. This is because of higher consciousness, not because you have answers.</p>
<p>然而，你能够察觉到盟友的存在，并且有能力辨别他们讯息的有效性。你对生命和自然的了解足以理解他们的观点、他们所强调的内容以及他们为何如此重要。这是因为你拥有更高的意识，而非因为你拥有答案。</p>
<p>The Allies of Humanity Briefings promote questions. The reason they do not answer every question is because you must develop the higher consciousness. If they told the reader everything about themselves, people would say, “Huh, I don’t believe it! Marshall’s making it all up!” You see, without the higher consciousness, people cannot make a connection.</p>
<p>人类盟友的简报鼓励提问。他们之所以不会回答所有问题，是因为你必须发展更高的意识。如果他们把关于他们自己的一切都告诉读者，人们会说：“哈，我不相信！马歇尔全是胡编乱造的！”你看，没有更高的意识，人们就无法建立联系。</p>
<p>Already you can see the effects of the Pacification Program that is being generated by the Intervention. There are already many people who have fallen prey to this, either by their own inclinations or by outside influence.</p>
<p>你已经可以看到干预所催生的安抚计划的影响。已经有很多人沦为其中的牺牲品，无论是出于自身倾向，还是受到外界影响。</p>
<p>Here people are led to believe that they cannot really judge anything. “Well, I don’t want to be negative. I’ll be open to it.” Who told them to be open to it? “I’ll be open to whatever happens.” Who told them to be open to whatever happens? People’s critical discernment is being destroyed. So something happens and they say, “Well, you know, I don’t want to judge the situation.” What are you talking about! You need to evaluate what is happening.</p>
<p>人们被引导相信，他们无法真正评判任何事。“好吧，我不想消极。我会敞开心扉去面对。”谁告诉他们要敞开心扉？“无论发生什么，我都会敞开心扉去面对。”谁告诉他们要敞开心扉去面对？人们的批判性洞察力正在被摧毁。所以发生了一些事情，他们说：“好吧，你知道的，我不想评判这种情况。” 你在说什么！你需要评估正在发生的事情。</p>
<p>These people think they cannot be critical. “Well, I can’t really be critical. I don’t want to be negative.” Well, it may be necessary to speak out and say that something is really not appropriate. But these people cannot even do that. People who have been affected by this Pacification Program cannot even make a decision. They cannot look at anything and say, “Well, this is a good thing,” or “This is really not a good thing for me.” So they welcome everything, thinking that is how you must be with life.</p>
<p>这些人认为他们无法批评。“嗯，我真的不能批评。我不想持消极态度。”好吧，也许有必要站出来指出某些事情确实不合适。但这些人甚至连这一点都做不到。受到安抚计划影响的人甚至无法做出决定。他们无法审视任何事物，然后说：“嗯，这是一件好事”，或者“这对我来说真的不是一件好事”。所以他们欢迎一切，认为生命就该如此。</p>
<p>That is not how you must be with life. It is true you must be willing to look at everything. But it is not true that you must accept everything, bond with everything, welcome everything. Of course not. Higher consciousness does not mean that you do not make critical evaluations. It simply means you view things from a higher vantage point.</p>
<p>你不必如此对待生命。你的确必须愿意审视一切。但这并不意味着你必须接受一切、与一切紧密相连、欢迎一切。当然不是。更高的意识并不意味着你不做批判性评价。它只是意味着你从更高的视角看待事物。</p>
<p>This does not mean that everything becomes gray. It means that everything becomes clear. You clearly see what to do and what not to do, what is good and what is not good. If this is not the product of spiritual study, then someone is being disabled.</p>
<p>这并不意味着一切都变得灰暗。这意味着一切都变得清晰。你清楚地看见什么该做，什么不该做，什么是好的，什么是不好的。如果这不是精神学习的成果，那么有人就被蒙蔽了。</p>
<p>While it is true you must learn not to judge a situation based upon your conditioning or beliefs, ultimately you must judge a situation based upon Knowledge, the spiritual Intelligence that lives within you. This is the final arbiter in your discernment.</p>
<p>诚然，你必须学会​​不基于你的条件或信仰来评判情境，但最终你必须基于内识，即你内在的精神智能来评判情境。这是你辨识力的最终裁决者。</p>
<p>However, people do not recognize this. They take the first step and they think it is the last step. The first step is where you do not judge. This means you must learn to look and recognize something, which you cannot do if you judge it immediately. This is the first step, but people think it is the last step.</p>
<p>然而，人们没有意识到这一点。他们迈出了第一步，却认为这是最后一步。第一步就是不去评判。这意味着你必须学会​​观察和识别事物，而如果你立即做出判断，你就无法做到这一点。这是第一步，但人们却认为这是最后一步。</p>
<p>The last step is very different from the first step. You do not judge in the moment because you need to see and know and recognize what you are looking at. This is discernment. You cannot be discerning if you judge things outright. Yet beyond this discernment, you must see clearly if something is good or not.</p>
<p>最后一步与第一步截然不同。你此刻不去评判，因为你需要看见、知道并认识到你所观察的事物。这就是辨识力。如果你直接评判事物，你就无法具备辨识力。然而，除了这种辨识力之外，你必须清晰地辨别事物的善恶。</p>
<p>So you may recognize that the Intervention really is not good for humanity. In itself, the Intervention is not a good thing! But if you say, “Oh, I cannot judge the situation,” how will you ever know? You may want to think, “Well, it’s probably good at some other level.” A pacified person will say, “I will see how it is good for us because everything that happens is good for us.” This is not only human ignorance; this demonstrates the effects of the Pacification Program, which encourages people to trust things unwittingly, without discernment.</p>
<p>所以你或许认识到干预确实对人类不利。干预本身并非好事！但如果你说：“哦，我无法评判形势，”你怎么知道呢？你或许会想：“嗯，它或许在其他层面上是好的。”一个平静的人会说：“我会看看它对我们有什么好处，因为发生的一切都对我们有利。”这不仅是人类的无知；这展现了安抚计划的影响，它鼓励人们在不知不觉中、不加辨别地相信事物。</p>
<p>You can see this everywhere. You can see it in the UFO community. You can see it in spiritual communities. You can see it emerging in people all around you. The Allies Briefings will create a stir because they advocate discernment. They say, “The Intervention is not good for you.” Yet many people say, “Well, I don’t know. It must be good. I mean, it can’t be bad.” They are befuddled. They do not know what to think. “Well, I don’t know. I can’t really come to any decisions about it.”</p>
<p>你可以在任何地方看到这种情况。你可以在UFO社群看到它。你可以在精神社区看到它。你可以在你周围的人身上看到它。盟友简报会引起轰动，因为他们提倡辨别力。他们说：“干预对你们没有好处。”然而很多人说：“嗯，我不知道。它一定是好的。我的意思是，它不可能是坏的。”他们感到困惑。他们不知道该怎么想。“嗯，我不知道。我真的无法对此做出任何决定。”</p>
<p>What are you talking about? Has your decision making become disabled? And if so, who disabled it? Why are some people thinking they must be open to everything and receptive to everything? Yes, they want to be non-judgmental, but that is only the first step. They do not take the next step. They do not exercise discernment. In some cases, their discernment has fallen away.</p>
<p>你在说什么？你的决策能力是不是变得迟钝了？如果是，是谁让它迟钝了？为什么有些人认为他们必须对一切都敞开心扉，接纳一切？是的，他们想要不带评判，但这只是第一步。他们没有迈出下一步。他们没有运用辨别力。在某些情况下，他们的辨别力已经消失了。</p>
<p>This is a critical problem. As a result of this Pacification Program, people cannot see and cannot know, and basically, though they are confused and frightened perhaps, they will just go along. “Well, I’ll just go along. I’ll just try to accept what is happening in my life.” People who are pacified cannot resist. They cannot fight against something because they do not think it is all right to do that. They think that everything has to be embraced. Where did this come from?</p>
<p>这是一个关键问题。由于这个安抚计划，人们无法看见，无法知道。基本上，尽管他们或许感到困惑和恐惧，但他们只会随波逐流。“好吧，我就随波逐流吧。我只会试着接受生活中正在发生的事情。”被安抚的人无法反抗。他们无法反抗，因为他们认为这样做不对。他们认为一切都必须被接受。这种想法从何而来？</p>
<p>These ideas of unquestioned acceptance are prevalent in much of the spiritual teaching you see today. And people accept these ideas wholeheartedly. They think, “Well, this is the higher truth. We follow the higher truth.” Consider this in the light of the Pacification Program and you will begin to see how pervasive it really is.</p>
<p>这种不加质疑地接受的想法在你们今天看到的许多精神教导中盛行。人们全心全意地接受这些想法。他们认为：“嗯，这就是更高的真理。我们追随更高的真理。” 结合安抚计划来思考这一点，你就会开始看到它究竟有多么普遍。</p>
<p>People who are being pacified will be led to believe that they are gaining higher consciousness when in fact all of their power is being taken away from them. The Pacification Program is based upon an understanding of human psychology and human tendencies. Here people are conditioned to think that in order to be acceptable to God, they must basically give away what God has given them to use. “Well, to be acceptable to God, I must be meek and mild and non-judgmental and all-embracing of everything. I will look for the good in everything.”</p>
<p>被安抚的人们会被引导相信他们正在获得更高的意识，而实际上他们所有的权力都被剥夺了。安抚计划基于对人类心理和人类倾向的理解。在这里，人们被灌输了一种思维模式：为了被上帝接纳，他们必须放弃上帝赐予他们的一切。“嗯，为了被上帝接纳，我必须温顺、温和、不带评判、包容一切。我会在一切事物中寻找美好的一面。”</p>
<p>Where did this come from? Is such acquiescence purely a human invention? Is this something that people just concoct for themselves in order to be happy in the moment? Well, in some cases, this is true. But consider the pacification of humanity. How are people pacified? They are told what they want to hear, and they are told they do not really need to consider anything else. After all, if everything that happens to you is good, then why resist anything? Just embrace it all. This is the Pacification Program at work.</p>
<p>这究竟是怎么回事？这种默许纯粹是人类的臆造吗？难道这只是人们为了一时快感而编造出来的玩意儿吗？嗯，在某些情况下，的确如此。但想想人类的安抚。人们是如何被安抚的？他们听到的都是他们想听的，他们被告知其实不需要考虑其他任何事情。毕竟，如果发生在你身上的一切都很好，那又何必抗拒呢？拥抱一切就好。这就是安抚计划在起作用。</p>
<p>This influence is becoming omnipresent around you. People flock to places where the Intervention is operating, thinking that the “energy” there is so high. They say, “This is such an enlightening place.” Oh, my God! They are jumping into the fire. They are giving themselves away wholeheartedly. They go to these places and they feel the energy there, and they think, “Oh, this is really a powerful place. This is where it is happening!”</p>
<p>这种影响正在你周围变得无处不在。人们涌向干预正在运作的地方，认为那里的“能量”如此高涨。他们说：“这真是一个启迪人心的地方。”哦，我的天哪！他们跳进火里。他们全心全意地交出他们自己。他们来到这些地方，感受到那里的能量，他们想：“哦，这真是一个强大的地方。这就是它正在发生的地方！”</p>
<p>And the longer they stay, the less they know, and the less they think they can return to their former lives. They become ever more listless and self-involved, and they become ever more dysfunctional.</p>
<p>他们待得越久，知道的就越少，也越觉得他们不可能回到以前的生活。他们变得越来越无精打采，越来越自我中心，也变得越来越不正常。</p>
<p>This disengagement produces an anxiety at a deeper level, a level where you know that your life is not progressing and that you are not going where you need to go. Yet these people will think that this discomfort is part of their fear, or part of their psychology that must be eradicated and exorcised out of themselves. And so they will work hard to ignore the very signs that are telling them that their lives are amiss and that they are losing their lives.</p>
<p>这种脱离会在更深层次的层面上产生一种焦虑，在这个层面上，你知道你的生命没有进步，你没有去到你需要去的地方。然而这些人会认为这种不适是他们恐惧的一部分，或者是他们心理的一部分，必须从他们自己身上根除和驱除。因此，他们会努力忽视那些告诉他们生活不顺、他们正在失去生命的迹象。</p>
<p>They will say, “All is love. Just be loving. There is only love.” If they knew what they were talking about, actually that would be true. But they think love is simply passivity, happiness and acquiescence because that is the Pacification Program working on them. Now they are extending it to other people and becoming pacifiers themselves.</p>
<p>他们会说：“一切都是爱。只要去爱就好。世上只有爱。”如果他们知道他们正在说什么，那确实没错。但他们认为爱只是被动、快乐和顺从，因为那是在他们身上运作的安抚计划。现在，他们把这种安抚扩展到其他人身上，他们自己也成了安抚者。</p>
<p>After awhile, well, they will not know what they know. And if something is really wrong, they will feel discomfort, but they will think it is just part of their psychological problem, and they will try to overlook it or remove it or bury it. And then they will do whatever is told them to do by the Intervention. They will say, “Oh, I got a message. I have to go do this. I am being guided. This is inner guidance for me.”</p>
<p>过了一段时间，好吧，他们就不知道他们知道什么了。如果真的出了什么问题，他们会感到不适，但他们会认为这只是他们心理问题的一部分，他们会试图忽略它、移除它或掩盖它。然后他们会按照干预的指示去做任何事。他们会说：“哦，我收到一条讯息。我必须去做这件事。我正在被引导。这是对我的内在指导。”</p>
<p>It will be very hard to awaken people from this. You have to awaken yourself first. People are so immersed in their listlessness and their pursuit of happiness, it is almost like they are beyond reach. They are so lulled and so conditioned, you would have to drop a bomb in their laps to wake them up.</p>
<p>要想让人们从这种状态中醒来非常困难。你必须先唤醒你自己。人们如此沉迷于他们的倦怠和对幸福的追求，几乎遥不可及。他们如此沉迷，如此受制于环境，你得在他们身上扔一颗炸弹才能唤醒他们。</p>
<p>You can see the effects of the Pacification Program in spiritual communities in many places. Certainly not to all people, but to many people, acquiescence looks like the easy path, the easy way, the way to true happiness. Give up knowing anything, give up evaluating anything, give up resisting anything, and it looks like, “Oh, everything is just happiness from now on. Smooth sailing ahead!”</p>
<p>你可以在很多地方的精神社区中看到安抚计划的效果。当然，并非对所有人都如此，但对许多人来说，顺从看起来是一条捷径，一条轻松的路，一条通往真正幸福的道路。放弃一切认知，放弃一切评价，放弃一切抗拒，看起来就像是：“哦，从现在开始一切都是幸福的。一路顺风！”</p>
<p>These nice people, the Intervention will simply lull them into a listless state and then basically they will not be a problem, and they will be receptive to whatever is given them. Their natural knowing will be so removed from their awareness, it will become the enemy now. They will think it is fearfulness. They will think it is negativity. And they will not want any part of it.</p>
<p>这些善良的人，干预只会让他们陷入一种倦怠的状态，然后他们基本上就不会成为问题，他们会接受任何给予他们的讯息。他们自然的认知会从他们的觉知中消失，现在它变成了敌人。他们会认为这是恐惧。他们会认为这是负面情绪。他们不想参与其中。</p>
<p>This is actually happening now. We are talking about an extreme case, but these extreme cases are growing in scope and magnitude. Many more people are simply falling into this state—even the young people, some of whom are especially prone to this kind of conditioning.</p>
<p>这种现象现在确实正在发生。我们谈论的是一个极端案例，但这些极端案例的范围和严重程度正在不断扩大。越来越多的人正陷入这种状态——甚至包括年轻人，他们中的一些人尤其容易受到这种状态的影响。</p>
<p>Consider this. True happiness comes from being true to yourself, from developing your own integrity and from living honorably with your integrity. True relationships are based upon sharing real integrity with others, building relationships of integrity, relationships that express your deeper nature and purpose in life.</p>
<p>深思这个事情。真正的幸福源于忠于你自己，源于培养你自身的完整性，源于以正直高尚地生活。真正的关系建立在与他人分享真正的完整性之上，建立完整性的关系，这种关系能够表达你更深层次的自然和生命的目的。</p>
<p>However, look at the relationships of a pacified person, who says, “Well, we’re together as long as it feels good, as long as it’s okay, and if we’re not together, it’s okay, and whatever we do is okay.” But it is not okay. And they know it is not okay, but their natural knowing has been removed from their awareness. As a result, they say, “I will not feel those things. They disrupt my happiness, my peace, my equanimity.” And yet there is no peace or equanimity because there is no integrity, and because there is no integrity, there is no real relationship.</p>
<p>然而，看看一个平静的人的人际关系，他们会说：“好吧，只要感觉好，只要没问题，我们就在一起，即使不在一起也没关系，无论我们做什么都没问题。”但这并不好。他们也知道这不好，但他们本能的认知已经被从他们的觉知中移除。结果，他们会说：“我不会去感受那些事情。它们扰乱了我的快乐、我的平静、我的安宁。” 然而，他们并没有和平或平静，因为他们缺乏完整性，而正因为缺乏完整性，也就没有真正的关系。</p>
<p>Do you see here how the poison is immersed in the very food that people want to eat? Spiritual food is being poisoned. How many spiritual teachers today are teaching real discernment? How many are promoting real personal integrity? How many are encouraging people to look clearly and see? How many teachers are encouraging their students to respond to the world? There are indeed some, but look around and you will see the Pacification Program being promoted unknowingly.</p>
<p>你是否看到，毒药是如何浸润在人们渴望食用的食物之中的？精神食粮正在被毒害。如今，有多少精神老师在教导真正的辨识力？有多少老师在提倡真正的个人完整性？有多少老师在鼓励人们清晰地观察和看见？有多少老师在鼓励他们的学生回应世界？确实有一些，但环顾四周，你会看到安抚计划正在不知不觉中被推行。</p>
<p>How perfect this is for the alien agenda. It takes time, but from their perspective, well, the results are worth it. The Intervention will then have a vast network of compliant people through which their agenda can flow. And the people will never know where it is coming from.</p>
<p>这对外星人的议程来说真是完美。这需要时间，但从他们的角度来看，结果值得。干预组织将拥有一个庞大的顺从者网络，他们的议程可以通过这个网络传播。而人们永远不会知道它来自哪里。</p>
<p>In another scenario, the situation becomes more complicated. Here the Intervention begins to show its darker side. Not everyone can be easily pacified. Those who cannot be pacified by the Intervention will be directed by the Intervention to judge those who oppose it.</p>
<p>在另一种情景下，情况变得更加复杂。在这里，干预开始展现其阴暗面。并非所有人都能轻易被安抚。那些无法被干预安抚的人，将被干预引导去审判那些反对它的人。</p>
<p>This will be particularly true for people who have extreme religious views and prejudices. These people will be directed to condemn those who do not share their views. Indeed, there are people in some religious communities who will receive messages that all the enemies of Christ must be eradicated if they cannot be saved and that the Second Coming will require the cleansing of the human family.</p>
<p>对于那些持有极端宗教观点和偏见的人来说，情况尤其如此。这些人会被引导去谴责那些与他们观点不同的人。事实上，一些宗教团体中的一些人会收到这样的讯息：基督的所有敌人，如果无法得救，就必须被彻底消灭；基督的第二次降临将需要人类大家庭的净化。</p>
<p>There are individuals today who are being so directed, and though they do not necessarily represent the leadership of these religious communities, their emphasis will grow as their frustration grows. They are waiting for the great arrival of Jesus, and they think it is not happening because of the sinfulness of the human family, sinfulness that must now be eradicated and not simply resisted.</p>
<p>当今有些人正受到这样的引导，尽管他们并不一定代表这些宗教社区的领导者，但随着他们挫败感的增长，他们的强调也会随之增长。他们在等待耶稣的伟大降临，他们认为这不会发生，因为人类大家庭的罪恶，这种罪恶现在必须被根除，而不仅仅是被抵制。</p>
<p>And the Jesus who will come will not be the real Jesus, but will be the Jesus prepared through the Intervention. This will be a false Jesus that they cannot really recognize because they are not developed in Knowledge. This Jesus will not bring peace but a reckoning. This reckoning will be welcomed by the followers because they are full of grievances themselves and believe that their prophecies are not being fulfilled because of the sinfulness of humanity and that this sinfulness must now be removed in order to bring Heaven on Earth.</p>
<p>而那位即将降临的耶稣，并非真正的耶稣，而是通过干预而预备好的耶稣。这将是一个虚假的耶稣，他们无法实际认出，因为他们的内识尚未发展。这位耶稣带来的不是和平，而是一种清算。这种清算将受到追随者的欢迎，因为他们自身充满怨恨，并相信他们的预言未能实现是因为人类的罪孽，而这种罪孽现在必须被移除，才能将天堂带到地球上。</p>
<p>Can you see for a moment how easy it would be for a Greater Community presence here, the Intervention, so skillful in influencing the mental environment and so aware of human tendencies and frailties, to provide this kind of influence? Can you see how, because of this manipulation, the righteous could begin to wage war against those people who disagree with them and against those who would preserve Knowledge in the world? Can you see how easy it would be for this to be generated?</p>
<p>你能否片刻想象，一个大社区在此的存在，一种干预，如此娴熟地​​影响心理环境，如此察觉人类的倾向和弱点，能够如此轻易地提供这种影响？你能否想象，由于这种操控，正义者如何能够开始对那些不同意他们的人、对那些在世界上守护内识的人发动战争？你能否想象，这一切是多么容易地被产生？</p>
<p>Even the true believers in Christ would be targeted, for they do not share these grievances, and thus they are not in conformity with those individuals who are being directed by the Intervention. True believers in Christ would emphasize harmony and recognition and tolerance. But those being directed by the Intervention only want revenge for their failed prophecies. They want God’s punishment to be exacted, and they are willing to be the executioners. They are willing to be the judge and the jury to carry out what they believe now is God’s Will. How will the Intervention eradicate its opponents? Should it gain enough power, you can see how this can be done.</p>
<p>即使是基督的真正信徒也会成为攻击目标，因为他们不认同这些怨恨，因此他们与那些被干预引导的个体格格不入。基督的真正信徒会强调和谐、认知和宽容。但那些被干预引导的人只想为他们失败的预言复仇。他们想要上帝的惩罚得到执行，他们愿意成为刽子手。他们愿意成为法官和陪审团，来执行他们现在认为的上帝意志。干预将如何铲除其对手？如果它获得足够的权力，你就能看到这是如何做到的。</p>
<p>Where pacification cannot be achieved, the Intervention will influence people to carry out their hostilities upon one another. As the world becomes more difficult, as resources diminish, as populations grow, as competition increases, as tragedy occurs more frequently, people’s sense of tolerance will diminish, and their grievances will be encouraged—not only by the Intervention, but certainly by those people who are ambitious and want to put themselves in positions of power.</p>
<p>在无法实现安抚的地方，干预将影响人们彼此实施敌对行为。随着世界变得更加艰难，随着资源的减少，随着人口的增长，随着竞争的加剧，随着悲剧的发生更加频繁，人们的宽容感将减弱，他们的不满将被鼓励——不仅是通过干预，当然也通过那些野心勃勃、想要将他们自己置于权力位置的人们。</p>
<p>How perfectly this falls into the alien agenda, which seeks to simplify and restructure human allegiance. The Intervention does not care what religion they use so long as it can achieve these results. That is why a devout Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist must all learn The Way of Knowledge. Otherwise, how could they tell the difference between a spiritual influence and a Greater Community influence? To the undiscerning, well, it all looks like it’s coming from a higher place, from the Heavens. Who, then, can you trust?</p>
<p>这完全符合外星人的议程，他们试图简化和重构人类的忠诚。干预者不在乎他们使用什么宗教，只要它能达到这些结果就行。这就是为什么虔诚的基督徒、穆斯林、印度教徒或佛教徒都必须学习内识之路。否则，他们怎么能区分精神影响和大社区影响呢？对那些缺乏辨别力的人来说，嗯，这一切看起来都像是来自更高的地方，来自天堂。那么，你可以信任谁呢？</p>
<p>The Intervention can create wonderful spiritual scenarios to activate those individuals who are most prone to be their messengers. It is not difficult for the Intervention to do. They simply stage a drama and put someone in the middle of it, and this person cannot tell the difference.</p>
<p>干预能够创造美妙的精神场景，激活那些最容易成为其信使的个体。这对干预来说并不难。他们只需上演一出戏，把某人放在中间，而这个人无法分辨出其中的区别。</p>
<p>People do not know what a Greater Community presence is. To them, it is all coming from somewhere else, not at their level, but from a higher place. So, in one scenario, an image of Jesus is projected to a zealous person, and the zealous person says, “Jesus has come to me.” And the Jesus says, “You must gather my true followers and you must denounce all others!” And the zealous follower says, “Yes, Master, yes, Master!”</p>
<p>人们不知道大社区的存在是什么。对他们来说，这一切都来自别处，并非来自他们的层面，而是来自一个更高的地方。所以，在一个场景中，耶稣的形象被投射到一个狂热的人面前，这个狂热的人说：“耶稣来到我这里了。”耶稣说：“你必须聚集我真正的追随者，你必须谴责所有其他人！”狂热的追随者说：“是的，主人，是的，主人！”</p>
<p>Incredible? Yes. Impossible? No. If the alien agenda is to create a unified and compliant human allegiance, it must eradicate the dissident elements, the non-compliant elements. They will not do this themselves because then everyone will know that there is an Intervention.</p>
<p>难以置信？是的。不可能？不。如果外星人的议程是要建立一个统一且顺从的人类联盟，它就必须铲除异见分子、不顺从的分子。他们不会亲自这么做，因为那样的话，每个人都会知道有干预存在。</p>
<p>Instead, they will have human beings do it for them in the name of people’s religious convictions and prejudices. And no one will know what is behind it all. Some people will think it is Satan or Lucifer, but they will not know.</p>
<p>相反，他们会以人们的宗教信仰和偏见的名义，让人类为他们做这件事。没有人知道这一切背后的原因。有些人会认为是撒旦或路西法，但他们并不知道。</p>
<p>It is humanity’s ignorance that is its greatest weakness. It is humanity’s Knowledge that is its greatest strength. The Greater Community, the inhabited universe in which you live, is a very sophisticated environment of interaction and influence.</p>
<p>人类的无知是其最大的弱点。人类的内识是其最大的实力。大社区，你们所居住的有人居住的宇宙，是一个非常复杂的互动和影响环境。</p>
<p>If human beings are going to follow their prejudices, their hatreds and their grievances and cannot tell the difference between a spiritual and a Greater Community influence, then the Greater Community is an extremely hazardous environment. Someone in the Greater Community will eventually win you over to their Collective or to their cause. How will they do this? They will simply use what you already believe in rather than teaching you something new.</p>
<p>如果人类追随他们的偏见、仇恨和怨恨，无法区分精神影响力和大社区影响力，那么大社区将是一个极其危险的环境。大社区里的某些种族最终会把你们拉拢到他们的集团或他们的事业中。他们会怎么做呢？他们只会利用你们已有的信仰，而不是教你们一些新的东西。</p>
<p>This is why learning The Way of Knowledge is so vitally important because this teaches you about the reality of life and spirituality in the Greater Community. It teaches you about the nature of manipulation and how to safeguard yourself and others. It teaches you how to recognize the effects and the manifestations of the Pacification Program and what you can do today to develop your own immunity to these forces, which are so influential on other people.</p>
<p>正因为如此，学习内识之路至关重要，因为它教导你关于大社区的生命和精神性的现实。它教导你关于操控的本质以及如何保护你自己和他人。它教导你如何辨识安抚计划的影响和显化，以及你今天可以做什么来发展你自身对这些对他人影响巨大的力量的免疫力。</p>
<p>This is vitally needed in the world today. Every day men and women of good conscience are falling under persuasion that they cannot discern. It is a gradual process. But eventually they end up not even having a clue about what is happening in their lives and being hostile to any kind of correction.</p>
<p>当今世界需要这一点。每天都有良知的男男女女陷入他们无法辨别的诱惑之中。这是一个渐进的过程。但最终，他们甚至对他们生命中发生的事情一无所知，并且对任何形式的纠正都抱有敌意。</p>
<p>As you begin to develop this Greater Community awareness yourself and to share the Allies’ message with others, you will see this resistance. You will see people’s inability to respond. It is like someone has pulled the plug within them and now they just do not know anything.</p>
<p>当你开始发展这种大社区觉知，并与他人分享盟友的讯息时，你会看到这种阻力。你会看到人们无力回应。就好像有人拔掉了他们内心的插头，现在他们什么都不知道了。</p>
<p>And if they do respond at some level, they may try to pacify themselves. They will say, “Well, it’s just one point of view, and you know, we have to look for the good in this situation. We really have to embrace this situation. If the visitors are here, then they must be here for a purpose, and we have to open ourselves to this purpose. Maybe some of them are not good, but some of them are, and we have to love them to understand them.”</p>
<p>如果他们确实在某种程度上有所回应，他们可能会试图安抚他们自己。他们会说：“嗯，这只是一种观点，你知道的，我们必须在这种情况下寻找好的一面。我们真的必须接受这种情况。如果探访者来到这里，那么他们来这里一定是有目的的，我们必须敞开心扉去接受这个目的。也许他们中的一些人并不好，但也有一些人是好的，我们必须爱他们才能理解他们。”</p>
<p>This is all pacification mentality. This is the easy thing to do. Just give in. And if happiness is the goal of your life, you will give in. You will compromise your integrity. You will deny your own anxieties. You will overlook the signs and the flags and the clues that tell you that something is not right here. You may tell yourself, “Well, it is all just part of the drama of life, and I will be above it all.”</p>
<p>这都是安抚心理状态。这很容易做到。屈服就好。如果幸福是你生命的目标，你就会屈服。你会损害你的完整性。你会否认你自身的焦虑。你会忽视那些告诉你事情不对劲的迹象、信号和线索。你可能会告诉你自己：“好吧，这只是人生戏剧的一部分，我会超越这一切。”</p>
<p>Throughout the world today, the wise are retreating because the Intervention is here. Only a few are in a position to advocate. Marshall (Vian Summers) is one of those people. Yet he will need others to help him. The world has not been lost. But the risk of it being lost is increasing.</p>
<p>当今世界，智者正在退却，因为干预已经到来。只有少数人能够发声。马歇尔（维安·萨默斯）就是其中之一。然而，他需要其他人的帮助。世界尚未失去，但失去的风险正在加剧。</p>
<p>Therefore, you cannot simply retreat and go live the rural pastoral life somewhere, tuning it all out, just being happy every day, going back to nature, carrying the water jugs, planting the corn, cooking the meals and living through the seasons. That is over! If you are going to be conscious, self-determined and have your own integrity, there is no running away now. There is no heading for the woods and pretending it is not happening.</p>
<p>因此，你不能简单地退隐到别处，过上田园牧歌般的生活，忘却一切，每天快乐地生活，回归自然，扛着水壶，播种玉米，做饭，度过四季。那样的生活已经结束了！如果你要有意识、自我决定并拥有你自己的完整性，现在就不能逃避。也不能逃到森林里去，假装一切都没有发生。</p>
<p>There is no more constant therapy on oneself. In the end, the only real therapy is to become real with what you know, to stand for what you know, to learn the wisdom necessary to carry what you know and to communicate what you know compassionately and powerfully. This is what any form of real therapy must lead to.</p>
<p>不再有持续不断的自我疗愈。最终，唯一真正的疗愈是真实地对待你所知道的内识，捍卫你所知道的内识，学习必要的智慧来承载你所知道的内识，并以同理心和力量传达你所知道的内识。任何形式的真正疗愈都必须指向这一点。</p>
<p>Are you going to go back and repair your childhood? Are you going to find the unrequited love that your parents did not give you? People who become too concentrated on these things become disabled. They become wheelchair bound in their own minds. They could all become advocates for the truth, but instead, all they become is advocates for therapy, and not a great deal of therapy done today leads to the truth.</p>
<p>你要回到过去，修复你的童年吗？你要找回父母未曾给予你的单恋吗？过于专注于这些事情的人会变得残疾。他们会被困在他们自己的心灵中，像轮椅一样被束缚。他们本可以成为真理的倡导者，但他们最终只是心理治疗的倡导者，而如今的心理治疗很少能带来真理。</p>
<p>There is no running away. There is no fulfilling yourself personally at the expense of establishing your own integrity, knowing the truth and standing for the truth.</p>
<p>没有逃避的余地。没有为了个人利益而牺牲你自身的完整性、知道真理和坚持真理的途径。</p>
<p>Humanity must become united, or it will be dominated in the Greater Community. This is so obvious when you think about it. If other forces beyond your world want your planet, its resources and human allegiance, well, if the human family is divided, you are really inviting others to move in on you. “Sure, come on! There is plenty of room for everyone!”</p>
<p>人类必须团结起来，否则将在大社区中被支配。只要你认真思考一下，这一点就显而易见了。如果你们世界之外的其他势力觊觎你们的星球、它的资源以及人类的效忠，那么，如果人类大家庭分裂了，你们实际上是在邀请其他种族来侵占你们。“当然，来吧！这里有足够的空间容纳所有人！”</p>
<p>Those who resist the Intervention will be accused of being unenlightened and fearful. Some will be accused of resisting the Intervention to protect their special interests. And there are some people who will resist the Intervention for these interests. However, there are those who will resist the Intervention because it is an Intervention. But with the Pacification Program, who can even call it for what it is? Who can say, “This is what it is!” without incurring resistance and condemnation? This is a real problem today.</p>
<p>那些抵制干预的人将被指责为愚昧和恐惧。一些人将被指责抵制干预是为了保护他们的特殊利益。有些人会为了这些利益而抵制干预。然而，有些人会抵制干预，因为它本身就是一种干预。但是，对于安抚计划，谁能直呼其名？谁能说“这就是它！”而不招致抵制和谴责？这是当今一个真正的问题。</p>
<p>We encourage the development of people’s discernment, discretion and the application of their critical faculties. What we encourage here is not based upon personal prejudice or social conditioning, but upon Knowledge. Knowledge is the part of you that knows. It is the greater Mind within you that the Creator has given to you to meet the challenges and opportunities of your life. It is the voice of conscience within you. People compare their belief systems and judge each other, but this is not what we are talking about.</p>
<p>我们鼓励人们发展辨识力、判断力以及运用他们的批判能力。我们在此所鼓励的并非基于个人偏见或社会熏陶，而是基于内识。内识是你知道的部分。它是造物主赋予你内在的更伟大心灵，帮助你应对生命中的挑战和机会。它是你内在良知的声音。人们会比较彼此的信仰体系并互相评判，但这并不是我们讨论的重点。</p>
<p>We are talking about rescuing humanity from a situation which would enslave it. We are talking about preserving human freedom and self-determination and encouraging human integrity in the midst of forces from the Greater Community who are intervening in your world.</p>
<p>我们谈论的是将人类从奴役的境地中拯救出来。我们谈论的是维护人类的自由和自决权，并在来自大社区势力干预你们的世界之际，鼓励人类的完整性。</p>
<p>Is achieving this impossible? Well, in a way, the truth always looks impossible. The promotion and preservation of the truth always looks like it is facing insurmountable odds. But that is only because the truth is not valued, recognized and felt deeply by enough people. What will get humanity out of this predicament is the same thing that will get humanity out of every predicament. It is facing the truth and doing what needs to be done.</p>
<p>实现这一点不可能吗？好吧，在某种程度上，真理总是看起来遥不可及。推广和维护真理总是看似面临着难以克服的困难。但这仅仅是因为真理没有被足够多的人重视、认可和深刻感受。能够帮助人类摆脱这种困境的方法，与能够帮助人类摆脱所有困境的方法是一样的。那就是直面真理，并去做那些需要做的事情。</p>
<p>There are many people in the world today who are very uncomfortable because they know that something really wrong is happening. Perhaps they think that their discomfort is just their own psychological problem. Perhaps they think it is a political, economic or environmental problem alone.</p>
<p>当今世界上有许多人感到非常不安，因为他们知道一些真正不对劲的事情正在发生。也许他们认为这种不安只是他们自身的心理问题。也许他们认为这仅仅是政治、经济或环境问题。</p>
<p>If they do not have a Greater Community awareness, then they have to focus their attention on something else and look for some other kind of cause. But they know that something is not right about what is happening today. Things do not feel right. Things are moving in a direction that they should not be moving in.</p>
<p>如果他们缺乏大社区觉知，那么他们就必须把注意力集中到其他事物上，寻找其他原因。但他们知道今天发生的事情有些不对劲。事情感觉不对劲。事情正朝着不该的方向发展。</p>
<p>Something is going on that is going to change things, but not in a good way. And the people who feel this are uncomfortable. They wake up with this discomfort; they go to bed with this discomfort. It is just there. They feel it when they are out in the world. Something is not right.</p>
<p>有些事情正在发生，它即将改变一切，但并非以一种好的方式。感受到这种改变的人感到不安。他们醒来时感到不安，入睡时也感到不安。这种不安就在那里。当他们走出去时，他们也能感觉到。有些事情不对劲。</p>
<p>Where does this discomfort come from? Why is it there? You can meditate. You can go on vacation. You can have nice food. And you can have moments of delight. But then you return to the discomfort. Something is amiss. It’s not simply because there is poverty or war or deprivation in the world. These have always been with you. Something else is going on here. Something else is really not right.</p>
<p>这种不适感从何而来？它为何存在？你可以冥想，可以去度假，可以享用美食，可以拥有片刻的愉悦。但随后你又回到了不适感。有些事情不对劲。这不仅仅是因为世界上存在贫穷、战争或匮乏。这些一直伴随着你们。这里一定有其他事情正在发生。有些事情真的不对劲。</p>
<p>Yet you look around and most people are oblivious. They do not know it. They do not feel it. And they do not care. Or they have good excuses. “Well, you know. It’s just human nature,” or “You know, it’s people’s fear. They just need to be more loving.” And you hear really lame excuses for something that is tremendous.</p>
<p>然而，环顾四周，大多数人对此视而不见。他们不知道，感受不到，也不在乎。或者他们有很好的借口。“嗯，你知道的，这只是人性，”或者“你知道，这是人们的恐惧。他们只是需要更多的爱。”你听到的，其实是为一件极大的事情找的蹩脚借口。</p>
<p>Your awareness needs to grow. Your fire needs to grow and become stronger—the fire of truth, the fire of Knowledge. Otherwise, your fire is always snuffed out, extinguished by personal ambivalence, personal fear, personal preference or the kind of listlessness that is the product of the Pacification Program.</p>
<p>你的觉知需要成长。你的火焰需要增长、变得更强大——真理之火，内识之火。否则，你的火焰总会被扑灭，被个人的矛盾、个人的恐惧、个人的偏好，或者被安抚计划带来的那种倦怠所扑灭。</p>
<p>The light of truth must become strong because there are greater forces of darkness here now. The deception is deep and complex. The denial is pervasive, and the acquiescence is pervasive and growing more so every day. Only Knowledge within you can penetrate it.</p>
<p>真理之光必须更加强大，因为此刻这里存在着更强大的黑暗势力。欺骗深刻而复杂。否认无处不在，默许也无处不在，并且日益加剧。只有你内在的内识才能洞悉它。</p>
<p>Humanity is losing its freedom, slowly but surely, and in such a way that this loss will be very complete because of the cleverness of the agenda behind it. This can happen because of the predispositions of so many people today. This can happen because of the effects of the Pacification Program, which is so well established now in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>人类正在缓慢但坚定地丧失自由，而且由于其背后巧妙的议程，这种丧失将会非常彻底。这种情况之所以发生，是因为当今许多人的先入之见。这种情况之所以发生，是因为安抚计划的影响，该计划如今在世界许多地方根深蒂固。</p>
<p>Therefore, it will take courage and a strong advocacy to activate those people who already feel the discomfort, who already feel the problem but cannot identify it or its source. And it will take a strong advocacy to reach those people who have begun to acquiesce but whose sense of integrity is intact enough that they know that there is a problem within them and around them and who are struggling to maintain their clarity of mind as the fog descends.</p>
<p>因此，需要勇气和强有力的倡导来激活那些已经感受到不适、已经感受到问题却无法识别其本身或其根源的人们。也需要强有力的倡导来触及那些已经开始默许但其正直感仍然足够完整以至于他们知道在他们内部和周围存在着问题，并在迷雾降临时努力保持心灵清明的人们。</p>
<p>For those who have acquiesced completely, there may be no answer. They may be beyond your reach. It would take a Greater Power, the Angelic Presence, to reach them. But even here, it is quite difficult because the pacification can become so complete that people will think that the very hand of Grace that is trying to rescue them is the very thing they must avoid.</p>
<p>对于那些完全默许的人来说，或许没有答案。他们或许超出你的触及范围。需要一种更伟大的力量，天使的存在，才能触及他们。但即便如此，也相当困难，因为安抚可能变得如此彻底，以至于人们会认为，试图拯救他们的那只恩典之手正是他们必须避免的。</p>
<p>You can only reach those who are uncomfortable, who have a sense of knowing that their integrity is being violated and who have begun to feel the persuasion of the Intervention but have not acquiesced to it. There are many people in this camp. You are not speaking to a minority. This advocacy will take time. It is not something that can be done in a few weeks, months or years. It is something that must be continuous.</p>
<p>你只能触及那些感到不安、意识到他们完整性正在受到侵犯、并开始感受到干预说服但尚未默许的人。这个阵营中有许多人。你并非在向少数人讲话。这项倡导需要时间。它并非几周、几个月或几年就能完成的事情。它必须持续进行。</p>
<p>Humanity’s emergence into the Greater Community will be quite difficult because of the Intervention. It will require that a higher consciousness be cultivated, protected and maintained in enough people. It is going to require a greater level of discernment and discretion, greater care about who you associate with and what you communicate. It is going to require a greater awareness and sensitivity to the world and to those forces who are in the world now casting an influence over humanity.</p>
<p>由于干预，人类向大社区的迈进将相当艰难。这将要求在足够多的人身上培养、保护和维持更高意识。它将要求更高层次的辨识力和判断力，对与谁交往以及你交流什么更加谨慎。这将要求对世界以及对那些正在世界上对人类施加影响的势力有一种更伟大的觉知和敏感度。</p>
<p>Developing this awareness and this sensitivity and establishing one’s personal integrity and relationships that represent this integrity are absolutely fundamental for success. This is what will keep Knowledge alive in the world. This is what will build freedom and keep it alive in the world. This is what will keep humanity intact. For once you lose your integrity and your freedom, it is very difficult to regain them. Very difficult.</p>
<p>发展这种觉知和这种敏感度，并建立个人的完整性以及代表这种完整性的关系，对于成功而言绝对是至关重要的。这能让内识在世界上保持活力。这能让自由在世界上建立并保持活力。这能让人类保持完整性。因为一旦你们失去了你们的完整性和你们的自由，就很难再找回它们。非常困难。</p>
<p>Even when people have sacrificed their integrity for relationships or for money or for advantage, even under these more normal circumstances, it is very difficult to regain it. You have to mount tremendous effort and take risks. It is easier, then, to stay out of trouble than it is to get out.</p>
<p>即使人们为了人际关系、金钱或利益而牺牲了他们的完整性，即使在这些较为正常的情况下，也很难重新获得它。你必须付出巨大的努力并承担风险。因此，避免麻烦比摆脱麻烦更容易。</p>
<p>You do not want to become a prisoner in your own world. You do not want to become a prisoner in your own mind. You do not want to become a prisoner to anyone or anything else.</p>
<p>你不想成为你自身世界的囚徒。你不想成为你自身心灵的囚徒。你不想成为任何人或任何事的囚徒。</p>
<p>If you could have a Greater Community perspective in these matters, you would recognize that though humanity has great difficulties and serious weaknesses, it is still relatively free in the universe. Of course, living on the surface of your world in isolation, you cannot see this because you do not have the perspective.</p>
<p>如果你能拥有一个大社区的视角来看待这些事情，你就会认识到，尽管人类面临着巨大的困难和严重的弱点，但它在宇宙中依然相对自由。当然，孤立地生活在你们世界的表面，你无法看到这一点，因为你没有这样的视角。</p>
<p>That is why The Allies Briefings are so valuable, because they give you a perspective that you yourself could not otherwise have. How could you compare yourself to the rest of life in the universe? How could you understand the value of your freedom if you could not see that freedom like this is rare and must be protected well in the Greater Community?</p>
<p>正因如此，盟友简报才如此宝贵，因为它赋予了你一种你自己原本无法拥有的视角。你如何可以将你与宇宙中其他生命进行比较？如果你看不到这样的自由是罕见的，并且必须在大社区中得到妥善保护，你怎么能理解你们自由的价值？</p>
<p>This is why the Allies provide a greater perspective. Yet some people will complain, “Well, they do not give us answers. They do not tell us dates and facts and figures and locations.” That is not what is important. It is the understanding, the perspective, the higher consciousness that are critically important.</p>
<p>正因如此，盟友才能提供一种更伟大的视野。然而有些人会抱怨：“嗯，他们没有给我们答案。他们没有告诉我们日期、事实、数据和地点。”这并非关键所在。至关重要的是理解、视角和更高意识。</p>
<p>Who cares where the Allies come from? The names of their worlds would be meaningless to you. You are not going to be able to go there for so long! Certainly not in your lifetime.</p>
<p>谁在乎盟友从哪里来？他们的星球名字对你来说毫无意义。你很长时间都去不了那里！这辈子肯定去不了。</p>
<p>The Allies are providing what is important for you to know about the Greater Community and about the Intervention. They are telling you who is here, why they are here and what they are doing. They are pointing the way to what must be done to counteract this Intervention, which includes the development of Greater Community awareness and a higher consciousness.</p>
<p>盟友正在提供你们需要知道的关于大社区和干预的重要信息。他们正在告诉你们谁在这里，他们为何在这里，以及他们正在做什么。他们正在指明必须做什么来对抗这个干预，这包括发展大社区觉知和更高意识。</p>
<p>This development must be emphasized always. It is so vitally important, or people will miss the whole point. They will just assume that this is merely some phenomenal thing that probably is not true anyway. Some will say, “These Allies don’t even tell us their names or how they got here.” This is stupidity.</p>
<p>必须始终强调这个进展。它至关重要，否则人们就会完全错失重点。他们会认为这不过是某种现象级的事件，而实际上可能根本不是真的。有些人会说：“这些盟友甚至不告诉我们他们的名字，也不告诉我们他们是如何来到这里的。” 这真是愚蠢至极。</p>
<p>If God sends an emissary, do you deny the emissary because he does not answer trivial questions? God has sent the Allies here to help educate humanity and to warn humanity of the grave risks that it faces at this time. Is this going to be denied because some trivial information is not provided?</p>
<p>如果上帝派遣了一位使者，你会因为他不回答一些琐碎的问题而拒绝他吗？上帝派遣盟友来到这里，是为了帮助教育人类，并警告人类当前面临的严重风险。难道就因为没有提供一些琐碎的信息就否认这一点吗？</p>
<p>This is why the development of Greater Community awareness is vitally important now. This is why higher consciousness must be promoted and preserved. This is why you keep Knowledge alive in the world. It is this that must be supported and honored at this great turning point.</p>
<p>正因如此，发展大社区觉知现在至关重要。正因如此，更高意识必须得到推广和维护。正因如此，你要让内识在世界上保持活力。在这个伟大的转折点，这一点必须得到支持和尊重。</p>
<p>Honor this material. Recognize it as being a gift of Grace. Respond to it. Have the courage to do this. Resist the pacification. Resist the influence to become listless and unresponsive to your own Knowledge. Resist the temptation to devote yourself to your own happiness above and beyond everything else. Resist the temptation to attack people of other faiths, cultures or nations. Resist the Intervention through awareness, through advocacy, through understanding. Promote human cooperation, unity and integrity.</p>
<p>尊重这份资料。认出它是一份礼物。回应它。拥有勇气去做这件事。抵制安抚。抵制对你自身内识变得倦怠和麻木不仁的影响。抵制将你自身幸福置于一切之上的诱惑。抵制攻击其他信仰、文化或国家的人的诱惑。通过觉知、通过倡导、通过理解来抵制干预。促进人类的合作、团结与完整性。</p>
