<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on April 9, 2000 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2000 年 4 月 9 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many people, when reading The Allies of Humanity Briefings, will become afraid. They will read it as if they think it is real and genuine, which it is, and they will become frightened and want to withdraw. They will want to deny it in some way.</p>
<p>许多人在阅读人类盟友简报时会感到害怕。他们会把它读得仿佛它是真实的，事实也的确如此，他们会感到恐惧，想要退缩。他们会想以某种方式否认它。</p>
<p>In a way, The Allies of Humanity material reveals your weaknesses. It calls upon your strength. It calls upon your inherent wisdom. It calls upon Knowledge, the spiritual Mind within you, but it also reveals your weaknesses. It reveals your vulnerability. It reveals your lack of control over your own consciousness. It reveals your undefended borders to space. It reveals your assumptions, your preoccupations and overall your ignorance of life in the universe.</p>
<p>在某种程度上，人类的盟友材料揭示了你们的弱点。它召唤你们的实力。它召唤你们固有的智慧。它召唤内识，你们内在的精神心灵，但它也揭示了你们的软弱。它揭示了你们的脆弱性。它揭示了你对你自身意识的缺乏掌控。它揭示了你们对太空不设防的边界。它揭示了你们的假设、你们的执念以及总体而言你们对宇宙生命的无知。</p>
<p>Here it is important to ask yourself if humanity will ever encounter intelligent life from beyond its world. And if it does, when that happens, how will humanity respond? How will humanity know if its new visitors are friendly or not? How will humanity be able to discern the visitors’ motives and their consciousness? How will humanity be able to discern their organization, their methods and so forth.</p>
<p>在这里，重要的是要问你自己：人类是否会遭遇来自其世界之外的智能生命？如果真的遭遇，人类将如何应对？人类将如何辨别这些新的来访者是否友善？人类将如何辨别来访者的动机和意识？人类将如何辨别他们的组织、手段等等。</p>
<p>If you consider these questions seriously, you will realize that you have very few answers. And without answers, perhaps you will become afraid. You will feel your own vulnerability, and you will feel how unprepared people really are for an encounter such as this.</p>
<p>如果你认真思考这些问题，你就会意识到，你几乎没有什么答案。而如果没有答案，你或许会感到害怕。你会感受到你自身的脆弱性，你会感受到人们面对这样的遭遇是多么的毫无准备。</p>
<p>Because most people still think that they are alone in the universe, that they have always been alone and will always be alone, well, this important set of questions really does not get considered by very many people. And even those who do consider it often think very romantically about life in the universe and what it will bring humanity and how much humanity will gain from this encounter. They think how interested the visitors will be in humanity’s art and culture, history and temperament.</p>
<p>因为大多数人仍然认为他们在宇宙中是孤独的，认为他们一直以来都是孤独的，并且永远都是孤独的，所以，这一系列重要的问题实际上并没有被很多人认真思考过。即使是那些认真思考过这些问题的人，也常常对宇宙中的生命、它将给人类带来什么以及人类将从这次相遇中获益多少抱有非常浪漫的幻想。他们想象着这些来访者会对人类的艺术、文化、历史和气质产生多么浓厚的兴趣。</p>
<p>So even amongst the very few people who really consider these questions and think they are important, there is often a great deal of romantic speculation. People are afraid to be realistic regarding life in the universe because it reveals their weaknesses. When we speak of weaknesses, we are not talking about your lack of technology. Really, what we are talking about is your lack of awareness, your lack of focus in life, your lack of social cohesion in your nations and cultures.</p>
<p>因此，即使在极少数真正思考这些问题并认为它们很重要的人中，也常常存在着大量的浪漫主义臆测。人们害怕以现实的态度看待宇宙中的生命，因为这会暴露他们的弱点。我们所说的弱点，并非指你们缺乏科技。我们真正谈论的是你们缺乏觉知，缺乏生命的焦点，以及你们国家和文化中缺乏社会凝聚力。</p>
<p>Humanity is divided and contentious within itself. This makes you vulnerable to outside forces. But really your vulnerability goes even beyond this because it has to do with your state of mind. It has to do with your view of yourself and your world. It has to do with your assumptions, your illusions and your preoccupations.</p>
<p>人类内部分裂纷争，这让你们容易受到外部势力的冲击。但实际上，你们的脆弱性远不止于此，因为它与你们的心灵状态有关。它与你们对自己和世界的看法有关。它与你们的假设、你们的幻想和你们的执念有关。</p>
<p>It is as if a great storm were building and had been building for some time, but people paid no attention. And then when the storm hits, well, it hits with such fury. It hits with such an impact. People are completely taken by surprise and are outraged and terrified. And yet the signs were there.</p>
<p>它就好像一场巨大的风暴正在酝酿，而且酝酿了一段时间，但人们却毫不在意。然而，当风暴来袭时，它来势汹汹，冲击力巨大。人们完全措手不及，既愤怒又恐惧。然而，迹象已经显现。</p>
<p>Even human science is beginning now to acknowledge the preponderance of life in the universe as a theoretical probability. Yet who is concerned with what your first great encounters might mean?</p>
<p>就连人类科学现在也开始承认宇宙中存在生命，这在理论上是可能的。然而，谁又会关心你们第一次的伟大邂逅究竟意味着什么呢？</p>
<p>As The Allies Briefings are presented, there will be all kinds of denial, criticism and repudiation. Why? Why so much rejection over an encounter that everyone really considers to be very possible? Yet when it is actually accounted for, you will see a great deal of denial. “Outrageous! Ridiculous! Cannot happen!” You will hear scientists say, “Well, it is not possible for another race to get here given the limitations of travel and speed and so forth.”</p>
<p>随着盟友简报的发布，各种否认、批评和驳斥将接踵而至。为什么？为什么一场人人都认为很有可能发生的相遇，却遭到如此多的拒绝？然而，当它真正被提及时，你会看到大量的否认。“太离谱了！太荒谬了！不可能发生！”你会听到科学家们说：“嗯，考虑到旅行、速度等等的限制，其他种族不可能到达这里。”</p>
<p>How presumptuous! Do human beings dare to presume what other nations and cultures have been able to develop over a long period of time? Is the universe limited by human understanding? Is it not possible that other races could have far surpassed human accomplishment in technology?</p>
<p>真是妄自尊大！人类竟敢妄加揣测其他民族和文化在漫长岁月中取得的成就？宇宙难道受限于人类的理解吗？其他种族的科技成就难道不可能远远超越人类吗？</p>
<p>You may say, “Well, of course!” But when faced with the prospect of a real encounter, people sing a very different tune. Their idealism leaves them. Their romanticism is thrown into doubt. Their glorious anticipation is overshadowed with concern and anxiety.</p>
<p>你可能会说：“好吧，当然！”但当真正面临相遇的可能时，人们却唱起了截然不同的调子。他们的理想主义离他们而去。他们的浪漫主义陷入怀疑。他们美好的期盼被担忧和焦虑所笼罩。</p>
<p>So when the Allies of Humanity message is presented, people begin to feel the real core of their fear, their lack of preparation, the weakness of their position. The Allies present a very realistic view of life in the universe. They are not here to answer every question that you may have, but instead to give you an awareness of what is really occurring in the world today and also to dispel much of the fanciful speculation that surrounds the prospect of humanity encountering other forms of intelligent life.</p>
<p>因此，当人类盟友的讯息被呈现时，人们开始感受到他们恐惧的真正核心，他们的准备不足，以及他们立场的薄弱。盟友呈现了一种对宇宙生命非常现实的看法。他们并非来回答你们所有的问题，而是让你们觉知当今世界正在发生什么，并驱散围绕着人类可能遭遇其他智能生命形式的前景的许多不切实际的猜测。</p>
<p>Even fanciful expectation, hopeful expectation, really has fear at its core because you are uncertain, because you do not know, because you are unprepared, because you realize in a moment of honest recognition how vulnerable you really are, living on the surface of your world, exposed to the universe and undefended.</p>
<p>即使是幻想中的期望、充满希望的期待，其核心也确实充满恐惧，因为你不确定，因为你不知道，因为你没有准备好，因为你在诚实认知的时刻意识到你是多么脆弱，生活在你的世界的表面，暴露在宇宙中，毫无防备。</p>
<p>Think for a moment if you were another race visiting your world and you wanted to just simply observe human behavior. Just observe it, without interfering. Well, you could look down on everything. It is all there. Human activity, human involvements, human conflict, human relationships, human technology, human communication—it is all available to the discreet observer.</p>
<p>试想一下，如果你是另一个种族，造访你们的星球，你只想观察人类的行为。只是观察，不加干涉。那么，你就可以俯视一切。一切都在那里。人类的活动、人类的参与、人类的冲突、人类的关系、人类的科技、人类的交流——所有这些都对谨慎的观察者来说触手可及。</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very important to understand why people are afraid. The fear of the reality of contact is deep seated. Many people have this very glorified view that they are at the pinnacle of God’s Creation, that their religions are built upon the pre-eminence of human spirituality and human identity. What will happen when they find out that humanity is one little race evolving within a Greater Community of intelligent life? And that this race is actually very weak, divided and insignificant in the vastness of the Creation!</p>
<p>因此，理解人们为何感到恐惧至关重要。对接触现实的恐惧根深蒂固。许多人抱有这种极其荣耀的观点，认为他们处于上帝创造的巅峰，他们的宗教建立在人类精神性和人类身份的卓越之上。当他们发现人类只是在智能生命大社区中进化的渺小种族时，会发生什么？而这个种族在浩瀚的创造中实际上非常弱小、分裂且微不足道！</p>
<p>People’s religious views cannot tolerate this kind of realization. Many of these views are already being eroded by the discoveries of science that show that the universe does not revolve around this world, that this world is just a little planet revolving around an insignificant star in a vast galaxy amongst many. Where is human pre-eminence then? Who are you in the universe? Are you really important to anyone or anything?</p>
<p>人们的宗教观念无法容忍这种认知。许多这样的观念已经被科学发现所侵蚀，这些发现表明宇宙并​​非围绕着这个世界旋转，这个世界只不过是一颗小行星，围绕着浩瀚星系中一颗微不足道的恒星旋转。那么，人类的卓越之处又在哪里呢？你们在宇宙中究竟是谁？你们对任何种族或任何事物真的重要吗？</p>
<p>We are asking these questions to bring you into the core of your anxiety because you must confront this within yourself. The inability or unwillingness to do this is really the source of all human ignorance and presumption regarding humanity’s place in the universe and regarding the reality of the extraterrestrial Intervention that is occurring in the world today.</p>
<p>我们提出这些问题，是为了带你进入你焦虑的核心，因为你必须直面你内心的焦虑。无力或不愿这样做，才是人类对人类在宇宙中的地位，以及对当今世界正在发生的外星干预的现实，所有无知和臆断的根源。</p>
<p>People say, “Well, there is no Intervention happening here. How ridiculous! It is all the fancy of certain people and their need for attention or their boredom or something.” What are you really hearing here but an excuse? This is the way that one pacifies oneself from experiencing real anxiety.</p>
<p>人们说：“好吧，这里根本就没有什么干预。真是荒谬！这都是某些人的幻想，他们想得到关注，或者无聊之类的。”你在这里听到的其实只是借口？这只是人们为了安抚自己，避免经历真正的焦虑而采取的方式。</p>
<p>If you could consider this rationally and objectively, you would say, “Well, of course we would be visited at some point! I mean, if there is intelligent life in the universe, someone out there must know that we exist here.” And if you are not limited by the limitations of humanity’s science, that opens the door to many more possibilities.</p>
<p>如果你能理性客观地思考这个问题，你会说：“嗯，我们当然会在某个时刻被造访！我的意思是，如果宇宙中存在智能生命，那一定有种族知道我们在这里。” 如果你不受人类科学局限性的限制，那么这将为更多可能性打开大门。</p>
<p>If you can ask these questions, you might think to yourself, “Yes, of course humanity will be encountered. Yes, our resources will be scrutinized. Yes, our world will be evaluated. Yes, there are other powers in the universe that would perhaps want our world to be part of their organization. And yes, they would want to take advantage of this beautiful place in some practical way.”</p>
<p>如果你能问这些问题，你可能会想：“是的，人类当然会遭遇。是的，我们的资源将受到审视。是的，我们的世界将受到评估。是的，宇宙中或许还有其他大国希望我们的世界成为他们组织的一部分。是的，他们也想以某种实际的方式利用这片美丽的土地。”</p>
<p>You see, these observations are so obvious. These speculations, if you could call them that, are so reasonable, but people will not consider them. They will not face them because of their anxiety, because of their fear.</p>
<p>你看，这些观察是如此明显。这些推测（如果你可以称之为推测的话）是如此合理，但人们却不会去考虑它们。他们因为焦虑、因为恐惧而不愿面对它们。</p>
<p>In fact, the reality of life in the universe, the encounter with life in the universe and the Intervention itself together represent the most denied reality in the world today. People will think, “It is not important. I have my job. I have my family. I have, you know, my own daily problems. I mean, why should it matter to me?”</p>
<p>事实上，宇宙生命的现实、与宇宙生命的相遇以及干预本身，共同代表着当今世界最被否认的现实。人们会想：“这不重要。我有我的工作。我有我的家庭。你知道，我有我自身的日常问题。我的意思是，这对我来说有什么关系？”</p>
<p>What are you talking about? If there is an Intervention going on in the world, do you think that it is not relevant to you and to your life and to what will happen to you?</p>
<p>你正在说什么？如果世界上真的存在干预，你认为这与你、你的生命以及你将要发生的事情无关吗？</p>
<p>Do you see here? This is “isolationist thinking.” The Allies Briefings bring home the reality that humanity’s isolation is over. But the isolationist thinking continues, unabated. Unless you have a direct encounter with forces from the Greater Community where your life is disturbed or upset in some way, well, you will just continue on thinking the way you have always thought, living upon the assumptions that you have always lived upon, oblivious to the greater realities that are shaping your life and destiny.</p>
<p>在这里，你看到了吗？这就是“孤立主义思维”。盟友简报带你认识到人类的孤立时代已经结束的现实。但孤立主义思维仍在继续，丝毫没有减弱。除非你直接遭遇来自大社区的势力，你的生活在某种程度上受到干扰或扰乱，否则，你只会继续以你一直以来的方式思考，活在你一直以来赖以生存的假设之上，对正在塑造你生命和天命的更伟大现实视而不见。</p>
<p>How can God reach you to tell you to become alert and aware, to make you responsive to these greater realities that are changing your life and destiny?</p>
<p>上帝如何才能告诉你要保持警惕和察觉，让你对这些正在改变你的生命和天命的更大现实做出回应？</p>
<p>People love the idea of a God out there that will throw them a life preserver when they are drowning, but the idea that God will interfere in their life and show them something they really do not want to see, well, that is really a test of faith, isn’t it? That is exactly what is happening today.</p>
<p>人们热衷于相信上帝会在他们溺水时抛出救生圈，但上帝竟然会干预他们的生命，让他们看到一些他们不愿看到的事情，这真是对信仰的考验，不是吗？这正是今天正在发生的事情。</p>
<p>That is why the Teaching in Greater Community Spirituality is in the world because this is God’s Message to alert humanity to this greater reality and to prepare humanity. The awareness is not enough. If the awareness engenders primary anxiety and fear, people will not know what to do. They will say, “Oh, my God! What do we do?” And they do not know what to do because they have never had to respond to this directly before.</p>
<p>正因如此，大社区精神性教导才会来到这个世界，因为这是上帝的讯息，旨在警醒人类关注这个更大的现实，并帮助人类做好准备。仅有觉察是不够的。如果觉察引发了最初的焦虑和恐惧，人们将不知所措。他们会说：“哦，我的上帝！我们该怎么办？”他们不知道该怎么做，因为他们从未直接回应过这个问题。</p>
<p>That is why God’s Message brings with it the preparation so people can begin to think like they live in a Greater Community. Then they can begin to become aware that there are Greater Community realities out there that are going to have a direct impact on them, their lives and their world.</p>
<p>正因如此，上帝的讯息才带来准备，让人们能够开始像生活在大社区中一样去思考。如此一来，他们就能开始觉察到，外面存在着大社区现实，它们将直接影响他们、他们的生命以及他们的世界。</p>
<p>The preparation must give you this greater awareness and consciousness, this sensitivity. Otherwise, you are like an ant colony in a field that is about to be plowed under. And the poor ant colony has not a clue of what is about to happen. Up until the moment of their destruction, well, life will be as it has always been.</p>
<p>准备工作必须赋予你这种更伟大的觉知和意识，以及这种敏锐度。否则，你就像田里即将被犁翻的蚁群。可怜的蚁群对即将发生的事情一无所知。直到它们毁灭的那一刻，生命依然如故。</p>
<p>But you are not ants, and you have a consciousness. You can consider the future, and you can think about things that are beyond your visible range. And you can consider yourself living within a larger arena of life, both within the world and beyond the world within a Greater Community.</p>
<p>但你并非蝼蚁，你拥有一种意识。你能够思考未来，你能够思考超越你可见范围的事物。你能够思考你自己生活在一个更广阔的生命场景里，既在世界之内，也在世界之外，在一个大社区之中。</p>
<p>As you develop this Greater Community awareness, you begin to see that your world is a very special place, with wonderful attributes. And you may think, “Well, of course others would be interested in our planet. And interested in us, not because we are magnificent but because we are the stewards of this place. We control this world.” And you would begin to think very, very objectively about your situation here.</p>
<p>随着你发展出这种大社区觉知，你开始看到你们的世界是一个非常特殊的地方，拥有着奇妙的特质。你可能会想：“好吧，当然会有其他生命也会对我们的星球感兴趣。对我们感兴趣，不是因为我们多么伟大，而是因为我们是这个地方的管家。我们掌控着这个世界。”你会开始非常非常客观地思考你在此的处境。</p>
<p>However, even people who claim to be objective and scientific in their perspective are really still governed by this fundamental fear and anxiety and are still living under the general denial of the fact that the world is being visited and that the Intervention is occurring. They are in such a state of denial that they will not even consider it. They will not come near it. The information, the evidence, is all over the place, but they will not even come near it. They will just say, “Oh, no, no. That’s all foolishness. It’s just insecure people trying to get attention.”</p>
<p>然而，即使是那些自称客观、科学的人，实际上也仍然被这种根本性的恐惧和焦虑所支配，仍然普遍否认世界正在被探访、干预正在发生的事实。他们处于如此否认的状态，以至于他们甚至不会去考虑它。他们不会去接近它。信息、证据，到处都是，但他们甚至不会去接近它。他们只会说：“哦，不，不。那都是愚蠢的。那只是缺乏安全感的人试图引起注意而已。”</p>
<p>They are in denial. They think they are being reasonable, but really they are being so unreasonable. They are supporting and fortifying their own ignorance and the ignorance of others. And even if they cannot accept that the Intervention is occurring, well, the prospect of life in the universe is still a very wondrous, romantic journey to them. It is like something that you dream about in the most glorious ways. “Oh, we will meet these advanced races who will give us so much technology and enlighten us on how to live in peace and so forth.” This is all foolishness. They have not a clue what is happening out there in the universe.</p>
<p>他们在否认。他们自以为是通情达理的，但实际上他们如此不讲道理。他们在支持和强化他们自身以及他人的无知。即便他们无法接受干预正在发生，嗯，宇宙生命的前景对他们来说依然是一段非常奇妙、浪漫的旅程。它就像你以最辉煌的方式梦想的东西。“哦，我们将遇见这些先进的种族，他们将赋予我们如此多的科技，并启发我们如何和平地生活等等。”这完全是愚蠢的。他们根本不知道宇宙里正在发生什么。</p>
<p>If these reasonable people are given a Greater Community perspective, which the Teaching in Greater Community Spirituality provides, oh, my God. It touches that core fear and anxiety. And they feel in that moment how utterly vulnerable they are, how undefended they are, how unprepared they are. And you look at people, and they do not have a clue. And they do not want to have a clue. And you look at your world, and you say, “Oh, my God! We could be overtaken without our even knowing it!”</p>
<p>如果这些理性的人拥有大社区精神性教导所提供的大社区视角，哦，我的天哪。它触及了他们内心深处的恐惧和焦虑。他们会在那一刻感受到他们是多么的脆弱，多么的不设防，多么的毫无准备。你看着人们，他们毫无头绪。他们也不想知道。你看着你的世界，你会说：“哦，我的天哪！我们可能在不知不觉中就被超越了！”</p>
<p>If you did not have the preparation in Greater Community Spirituality, if you did not have anywhere to go with this awareness, it could be overwhelming because you would think that you had no recourse. It is as if humanity, like an unsuspecting native tribe, were just waiting to be taken over by someone else.</p>
<p>如果你没有在大社区精神性中做好准备，如果你没有带着这份觉知去任何地方，它可能会令你感到不知所措，因为你认为你无路可走。人类就像一个毫无戒心的土著部落，等待着被其他种族接管。</p>
<p>Then, of course, there is the problem with the assumption that technology equals salvation. This is becoming a modern religion in many cultures in the world. Developed nations increasingly believe that technology really is their salvation now. There is a problem? Well, technology will solve it. There is something we cannot understand? Well, technology will overcome it. There is a situation that could arise for which we are unprepared? Well, technology will meet the challenge.</p>
<p>当然，技术等于救赎的假设也存在问题。这正在世界许多文化中成为一种现代宗教。发达国家越来越相信技术才是真正的救赎。有问题？技术会解决它。有些我们无法理解的事情？技术会克服它。有些我们措手不及的情况可能出现？技术会应对挑战。</p>
<p>“We will meet the challenge with our technology in the eleventh hour.” There is a sort of unquestioned belief that technology is going to save you, regardless of what might happen—technology mixed with human ingenuity, that is. And no matter how overwhelming a situation might be, well, ingenuity plus technology will win the day in the final moments.</p>
<p>“我们将在最后一刻用科技迎接挑战。”有一种毋庸置疑的信念：无论发生什么，科技——也就是科技与人类独创性的结合——都会拯救你们。无论情况多么严峻，独创性加上科技，终将在最后时刻赢得胜利。</p>
<p>Can you see that this is all part of the denial? Wishful thinking is what it is. Regarding the Greater Community, it really is wishful thinking. Do you think humanity is going to generate a technological answer to the presence of Greater Community forces who may want your planet for themselves?</p>
<p>你能看出这都是否认的一部分吗？它只是痴心妄想。至于大社区，它真的只是痴心妄想。你认为人类能找到一个科技解决方案来应对那些可能觊觎你们星球的大社区势力吗？</p>
<p>We can assure you that it will not be at the level of technology that you will be able to counteract this presence and these influences. Facing a race that is perhaps a thousand years ahead of you technologically, do you think you are going to make a difference in the next few years?</p>
<p>我们可以向你保证，你们不可能凭借科技层面的力量来抵消这种存在及其影响。面对一个科技上或许领先你们一千年的种族，你认为你们在未来几年内能够有所作为吗？</p>
<p>Consider this: The answer will not happen at the level of technology. It will happen at the level of the mind and consciousness. Those who are intervening in the world today are very concerned about preserving the world’s resources and about preserving the human presence here as a workforce. They cannot use technology to accomplish this alone.</p>
<p>请思考：答案不会在技术层面出现。它将在心灵和意识层面出现。当今干预世界的种族非常关心保护世界资源，以及保护人类作为劳动力的存在。他们无法仅凭技术来实现这一点。</p>
<p>Yes, their technology is useful in neutralizing someone they may want to take for themselves for investigation. However, if they forcefully exert their technology on your world, they will destroy the world’s resources and destroy the human presence here, and they cannot do that. Therefore, they must use the very means that you are able to counteract.</p>
<p>是的，他们的技术确实有助于消灭他们想要带走调查的人。但是，如果他们强行将技术应用于你们的世界，就会摧毁世界资源，摧毁这里的人类生存，而他们无法做到这一点。因此，他们必须使用你们能够对抗的手段。</p>
<p>Yet here we run into fear again because people realize that without their technology, without the hope and the belief that technology is going to win the day and without human intellect being able to solve the problem, they are back in this very vulnerable place once again. But we are not talking about the intellect here.</p>
<p>然而，在这里，我们再次遇到了恐惧，因为人们意识到，没有了科技，没有了对科技终将胜利的希望和信念，没有了人类智力能够解决问题的能力，他们又回到了这种非常脆弱的境地。但我们这里谈论的并非智力。</p>
<p>It is not at the level of the intellect that humanity is going to be able to counteract this presence and to strengthen itself in the Greater Community. The intellect plays a very important role as far as technology goes and in certain kinds of problem solving. But in this situation, it will take a deeper awareness.</p>
<p>人类并非能够仅凭智力层面来对抗这种存在，并在大社区中增强它自身。就科技发展以及某些问题的解决而言，智力发挥着非常重要的作用。但在这种情况下，它需要一种更深层次的觉知。</p>
<p>After all, some of your most intellectually brilliant people are in total denial of the Intervention and think life in the universe is some distant possibility. And you ask yourself, “Well, if they are so brilliant and so well informed, why can’t they feel this presence in the world today? Why can’t they even face this as a possibility and study the evidence rather than dismissing it out of hand? If people are so smart, how can they be so stupid?”</p>
<p>毕竟，你们当中一些最聪明绝顶的人完全否认干预的存在，认为宇宙中存在生命是某种遥不可及的可能性。你会问你自己：“好吧，如果他们如此聪明，如此博学，为什么他们感觉不到这种干预在当今世界的存在？为什么他们甚至不能正视这种可能性，研究证据，而不是断然否定它？如果人们如此聪明，他们怎么会如此愚蠢？”</p>
<p>Ignorance is one thing. Ignorance can be compensated by gaining information and perspective. But this is not merely ignorance. This is arrogance. It is the assumption that you know what life is in the universe. Oh, my God! Humanity knows what life is in the universe? Oh, my God! Humanity is so far from knowing what life is in the universe, it is pathetic.</p>
<p>无知是一回事。无知可以通过获取信息和视角来弥补。但这不仅仅是无知。这是傲慢。这是自以为知道宇宙中存在什么生命。哦，我的天哪！人类知道宇宙中存在什么生命吗？哦，我的天哪！人类距离认知宇宙中存在什么生命还差得远，真是可悲。</p>
<p>Given the unfounded belief in technology as the source of human salvation, many people think, well, more technology is more salvation. And they think that technologically advanced races have evolved beyond being self-seeking and contentious and devious. They think that technologically advanced races do not have conflict and that these races have outgrown the chronic problems that humanity still faces. What a ridiculous assumption. You have technology today that your forefathers a hundred years ago could not even imagine. And yet have you overcome these problems yourselves?</p>
<p>鉴于科技是人类救赎之源这个毫无根据的信念，许多人认为，科技越发达，救赎就越大。他们认为，技术先进的种族已经进化得不再自私自利、争斗不休和奸诈狡猾。他们认为，科技先进的种族不会发生冲突，这些种族已经摆脱了人类仍然面临的顽疾。这是多么荒谬的假设啊。你们今天所拥有的科技，是一百年前你们的先辈们根本无法想象的。然而，你们自己克服了这些问题吗？</p>
<p>Therefore, do not look to the experts to give you the answer. You must find the answer yourself because the experts may not know and may not want to know. Remember, they are human beings just like you, and they have their own thresholds of fear and anxiety that they may not be willing to face.</p>
<p>因此，不要指望专家给你答案。你必须自己去找到答案，因为专家可能不知道，也可能不想知道。请记住，他们和你一样都是人，他们也有他们自身的恐惧和焦虑阈值，他们可能不愿意面对。</p>
<p>In a way, the Intervention is the most challenging thing that could happen to humanity. Part of humanity’s liability or weakness here is its presumption that it really understands life, that it really knows what is happening in the universe, that it understands who can travel, who cannot travel and how long it takes to get to planets. It assumes that human understanding sets the standard for all understanding in the universe. This is human arrogance, which supports and fortifies human ignorance.</p>
<p>某种程度上，干预是人类可能遭遇的最具挑战性的事情。人类在此的部分责任或弱点，在于它自以为真正理解生命，自以为真正了解宇宙正在发生什么，自以为了解谁能旅行，谁不能旅行，以及到达行星需要多长时间。它假设人类的理解为宇宙中所有理解设定了标准。这是人类的傲慢，它支持并强化了人类的无知。</p>
<p>It is presented in the Teaching in Greater Community Spirituality, and it is presented very boldly in the message from The Allies of Humanity, that life in the universe is challenging, difficult and competitive. And if you approach life in the universe romantically or if you deny it altogether, you do this at great risk.</p>
<p>大社区精神性教导中提出了这一点，人类盟友的讯息中也非常大胆地提出了这一点：宇宙中的生命充满挑战、艰难且充满竞争。如果你以浪漫的态度对待宇宙中的生命，或者如果你完全否认它，你就是在冒着巨大的风险。</p>
<p>What really needs to happen here is a whole new shift in human awareness and human learning. It is as if you have reached this great threshold and there must be a completely new paradigm of understanding. It is not simply that you are building on past understanding, adding another feature or another dimension to human awareness. It is really that you have to make kind of a leap here. This is because human understanding is still so grounded in an anthropocentric view of the universe, with humanity at the center of everything and the unquestioned belief that life in the universe functions according to human values and ideals.</p>
<p>这里真正需要发生的是人类觉知和人类学习的全新转变。就好像你已经到达了这个伟大的门槛，必须有一种全新的理解范式。它不仅仅是在过去的理解基础上构建，为人类觉知添加新的特征或维度。而是你必须在此实现某种飞跃。这是因为人类的理解仍然根植于以人类为中心的宇宙观，人类是一切的中心，并且毫无疑问地相信宇宙中的生命按照人类的价值观和理想运转。</p>
<p>For many people, there is still this idea that God is primarily concerned with humanity as the centerpiece of Creation and that everything else is just sort of wallpaper to this great human drama. Look at your religions. Are they really equipped to deal with the realities of the Greater Community?</p>
<p>对很多人来说，仍然存在这样的想法：上帝主要关心的是人类，将其视为创造的核心，而其他一切都不过是这场人类伟大戏剧的壁纸而已。看看你们的宗教。它们真的有能力应对大社区的现实吗？</p>
<p>Let Me give you this analogy: There are native tribes that have been overtaken and cultures that have been assimilated and destroyed countless places in your world in the last 500 years. It is still occurring today. They have their religions, which can be very expansive. But their religions usually do not include the reality of human life beyond their borders, which puts them in a very vulnerable position because they really do not know how to respond in the face of an Intervention.</p>
<p>让我给你一个比喻：过去500年里，你们世界上无数地方的土著部落被征服，文化被同化和摧毁。这种情况至今仍在发生。他们有他们的宗教，这些宗教可能非常广泛。但他们的宗教通常不涵盖他们边界之外的人类生命现实，这让他们处于一个非常脆弱的境地，因为他们真的不知道如何应对干预。</p>
<p>Compared to the Greater Community, humanity’s outpost in this world is like a little village in the jungle. And when this village is confronted with forces coming to seek advantages, what can it do? Well, interestingly enough, it can actually do a great deal.</p>
<p>与大社区相比，人类在这个世界上的前哨就像丛林中的一个小村庄。当这个村庄面对前来谋取利益的势力时，它能做什么呢？嗯，有趣的是，它实际上能做很多事情。</p>
<p>The first thing is to become aware of the Intervention and to face your own fear and anxiety. Here it is necessary to see how ill prepared you are, how vulnerable you are and how easily even you could be persuaded to think and to believe that the visitors are here for your benefit. This is the first threshold, a threshold which unfortunately many people will not cross. They will withdraw or go into denial or cast a very preferred perspective over the whole matter. The first threshold is to recognize your situation. Even if the Intervention were not occurring at this time, you know it would occur at some time.</p>
<p>首先要察觉干预，并面对你自身的恐惧和焦虑。在这里，你有必要看清你准备得多么不足，你多么脆弱，甚至你多么容易被说服去认为并相信探访者是为了你们的利益而来。这是第一道门槛，不幸的是，很多人无法跨越。他们会退缩，或陷入否认，或对整个事件抱有一种非常偏袒的视角。第一道门槛是认清你的处境。即使干预此时没有发生，你也知道它迟早会发生。</p>
<p>You see, it’s interesting. People have their grand notions of intelligent life in the universe and advanced technology and other races of altruistic beings out there floating around. Yet the thing that people are most afraid of is that they will encounter others like themselves, but more powerful. What is the thing that people are really afraid of regarding the prospect of encountering intelligent life from beyond the world? They are afraid they will meet themselves. In a different form, perhaps.</p>
<p>你看，它是有趣的。人们对宇宙中存在智能生命、先进科技和其他利他种族有着宏大的想象。然而，人们最害怕的是遇到与他们自己相似但更强大的种族。关于与外星智能生命相遇，人们真正害怕的是什么？他们害怕与他们自己的相遇。或许，是以另一种形式。</p>
<p>Perhaps the visitors will look different and use a different language and a different means of communication. But the thing that people are really afraid of, the thing that no one can even talk about, particularly in enlightened circles, is the reality that they are going to meet themselves.</p>
<p>或许，来访者看起来会有所不同，使用不同的语言，交流方式也会有所不同。但人们真正害怕的是，尤其是在开明的圈子里，没有人敢谈论的是，他们即将与他们自己见面的现实。</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that your visitors are human beings or that intelligent life functions according to human ideals and beliefs. What we are really telling you here, and what you must come to terms with, is that you are going to meet beings who are driven by the same needs that you are driven by.</p>
<p>这并不是说你们的访客是人类，也不是说智慧生命按照人类的理想和信仰运作。我们在这里真正想告诉你们，你们必须接受的是，你们将会遇到一些和你们有着同样需求的生物。</p>
<p>The Greater Community of life in which you live is a very competitive environment. You can see this competition in your own world. You can see it in the natural world. You can see it at the level of plants and animals.</p>
<p>你们所生活的生命大社区是一个竞争激烈的环境。你可以在你自身的世界里看到这种竞争。你可以在自然界中看到它。你可以在植物和动物的层面上看到它。</p>
<p>Yet the Greater Community is a competitive environment on a scale you cannot even comprehend. This means that everyone who is in that environment, particularly those who are active participants in trade and commerce, must find resources and gain alliances with other nations and often try to persuade those nations to enter into alliances with them.</p>
<p>然而大社区是一个你甚至无法理解的规模的竞争环境。这意味着身处该环境的每个生命，特别是那些积极参与贸易和商业的种族，必须寻找资源，与其他国家建立联盟，并经常试图说服这些国家与他们结成联盟。</p>
<p>The need for resources does not end because of technology. Technology does not end the fundamental needs of life. It hasn’t for you and it hasn’t for anyone in the universe. Yes, it frees you from certain basic activities, but it creates more complexity. You may not need to go out and hunt and fish for your food, or farm, but you must go to work. You must maintain a much more complicated life in order to afford the food that you need to eat.</p>
<p>对资源的需求不会因为科技的进步而终结。科技不会终结生命的基本需求。它并没有终结你，也没有终结宇宙中的任何生命。没错，科技确实让你从某些基本活动中解放出来，但也带来了更多的复杂性。你或许不需要出去打猎捕鱼来获取食物，也不需要耕种，但你必须去工作。为了负担得起你需要的食物，你必须维持一种更加复杂的生活。</p>
<p>Technology has freed you from hunting and gathering and has freed you from basic agriculture, but it has not freed you from the need for resources. Indeed, it has made your life more complicated and more exciting, but in other ways, more difficult and more stressful.</p>
<p>科技让你们摆脱了狩猎采集，摆脱了基础农业，但它并没有让你们摆脱对资源的需求。事实上，它让你的生命变得更加复杂、更加精彩，但在其他方面，也更加艰难、更加紧张。</p>
<p>It is the same with life in the universe. Everyone has to eat. Everyone has to maintain what they have created. Everyone must deal with other forms of intelligent life that may be vying or competing for basic resources. Do you think an advanced nation in the universe does not have a great need for resources?</p>
<p>宇宙中的生命也是如此。每个生命都需要吃饭。每个生命都需要维护他们创造的一切。每个生命都必须应对其他可能争夺基本资源的智能生命。你认为宇宙中一个先进的国家不需要大量的资源吗？</p>
<p>The larger nations or organizations may become, the more restrictive they will be regarding personal freedom for their constituents, and the greater the need will be for order and conformity. That is why in the universe the really free nations are small and isolated. Their technology has given them advantages, but they must protect it and keep it hidden.</p>
<p>国家或组织越大，对其成员个人自由的限制就越严格，对秩序和一致性的需求也就越大。正因如此，宇宙中真正自由的国家往往规模小且孤立。他们的科技赋予了他们优势，但他们必须保护这些优势，将其隐藏起来。</p>
<p>It would be like you getting a million dollars and going out into the marketplace with your million dollars. Well, what a rude shock. Now everyone is your friend. Now everyone wants to invite you to invest in their endeavor, in their project, or they need your financial help because they are in difficulty.</p>
<p>它就像你得到了一百万美元，然后带着它去市场。嗯，真是个意外的惊喜。现在每个人都成了你的朋友。现在每个人都想邀请你投资他们的事业、他们的项目，或者他们需要你的经济援助，因为他们遇到了困难。</p>
<p>If humanity were ever able to travel beyond its borders and carry its great incentive and enterprise into the universe, it would be like the little housewife having a million dollars and going out into the marketplace. You would not last very long.</p>
<p>如果人类真的能够跨越国界，带着它伟大的动力和进取心进入宇宙，那就像一个拿着一百万美元去集市的小主妇，撑不了多久。</p>
<p>You see, this reality of life, which is so denied, is something that must be faced. Who will you meet in the universe? You will meet others like you. Not exactly like you. Not looking like you or talking like you or dressing like you. But they are like you in their needs. And those who are resource explorers in the universe are not the spiritually enlightened.</p>
<p>你看，这个被如此否定的生命现实，是必须面对的。你会在宇宙中遇见谁？你会遇见和你们一样的生命。他们并非完全和你们一样。长相、谈吐、穿着都和你们不一样。但他们的需求和你们一样。而那些在宇宙中探索资源的生命，并非精神上的开悟者。</p>
<p>Therefore, it is necessary to counteract many of the prevailing assumptions and beliefs, fantasies and myths, because otherwise you cannot face the situation. And if you cannot face the situation, it will overtake you.</p>
<p>因此，有必要抵制许多普遍存在的假设、信念、幻想和迷思，否则你将无法面对现实。如果你无法面对现实，它就会将你击垮。</p>
<p>People pray to God for guidance, for strength, for courage and for peace, and God sends Greater Community Spirituality as a preparation. And people say, “What is this? I did not ask for this! What will I do with this? It isn’t relevant!” You do not know what is relevant. What you think is relevant may be important to you personally, but it is not going to protect your rights and your freedoms in the future.</p>
<p>人们向上帝祈祷，祈求指引、力量、勇气与和平，上帝却赐予大社区精神性作为准备。人们却说：“这是什么？我没有祈求过这个！我该拿它怎么办？这不重要！” 你不知道什么是重要的。你认为重要的东西可能对你个人很重要，但它不会在未来保护你们的权利和自由。</p>
<p>Humanity’s encounter with intelligent life in the universe is not the product of human journeys into space or human science or human philosophy or human religion. It is the result of the Intervention. It is the result of other races coming here in order to preserve the world for themselves, believing that humanity will destroy the world in its conflicts, that humanity will ruin the world’s valuable resources.</p>
<p>人类与宇宙智能生命的相遇，并非人类太空之旅、人类科学、人类哲学或人类宗教的产物。它是干预的结果。它是其他种族为了维护世界而来到这里的结果，他们相信人类将在其冲突中毁灭世界，相信人类将毁掉世界宝贵的资源。</p>
<p>Think about this. This is how people would react. If, let us say, developed nations in the world found some little tribe in the recesses of the jungles who were sitting on tons of gold or other kinds of minerals, or had vast forests full of valuable woods, do you think that the advanced nations would not intervene, particularly if they felt these resources were going to waste? Or how about if the natives were cutting down all the trees because they liked the sunlight or they wanted to grow their own food?</p>
<p>想想看。人们的反应会是这样的。假设世界上的发达国家在丛林深处发现了一个小部落，他们坐拥成吨的黄金或其他矿产，或者拥有广阔的森林，森林里满是珍贵的木材，你认为发达国家不会干预吗？尤其是在他们觉得这些资源会被浪费的情况下。或者，如果当地人因为喜欢阳光或想自己种植粮食而砍伐所有树木，你认为他们会怎么做呢？</p>
<p>Well, the nations of the world would be in there doing everything they could to get the resources, either legally or illegally. That is what human nations would do. Do you think they would sit by and let the natives just despoil or neglect what they have? Of course not. Well, if the land is of no value to the powerful nations, sure, give them their reservation. But if they are sitting on $100 million in gold, that would not be a reservation.</p>
<p>好吧，世界各国都会竭尽所能地获取资源，无论合法还是非法。这就是人类国家会做的事情。你认为他们会袖手旁观，任由原住民掠夺或忽视他们所拥有的一切吗？当然不会。好吧，如果这片土地对强国来说毫无价值，当然可以给他们保留地。但如果他们坐拥价值一亿美元的黄金，那就不是保留了。</p>
<p>Your world is viewed like that by your visitors and by others in the universe who see this precious little world and this race of relatively destructive beings destroying its natural resources and violating its natural laws. Do you think this would not produce an Intervention? Some people think, “Well, of course, they would come and ask permission to be here and our nations, our governments would work out a deal.”</p>
<p>你们的探访者以及宇宙中的其他种族就是这样看待你们世界的，他们看到这个珍贵的小世界，以及这个相对具有破坏性的种族，正在破坏它的自然资源，违反它的自然法则。你认为这不会导致干预吗？有些人会想：“嗯，当然，他们会来请求允许在这里居住，然后我们的国家、我们的政府会达成协议。”</p>
<p>Oh, my God! Are you kidding? What would happen instead is that those intervening races would establish a plan of intervention and integration because they want to preserve the human workforce. They cannot live in your world. They will have you do all the work. Get the natives to mine the gold. Just like what has happened in your world. Do you think the natives’ permission is needed?</p>
<p>哦，我的天哪！你在开玩笑吧？实际情况是，那些介入的种族会制定干预和整合计划，因为他们想保留人类劳动力。他们无法在你们的世界生活。他们会让你们做所有的工作。让原住民去开采黄金。就像你们世界发生的那样。你认为需要原住民的许可吗？</p>
<p>Well, maybe they will find a way to induce you to give your permission, but they are going to get what they want. In your situation in the world today, your visitors are going to get what they want unless you stop them. And the way you are going to stop them is not merely by using technology. It is by intelligence and by cunning. And by cooperation in the human family.</p>
<p>好吧，也许他们会想办法引诱你们给予许可，但他们终将得偿所愿。在你们当今世界的处境下，除非你们阻止，否则你们的探访者终将得偿所愿。而你们阻止他们的方式不仅仅是运用科技，而是凭借智能和狡猾，以及人类大家庭的合作。</p>
<p>The first step in counteracting the Intervention is awareness, but the awareness really is a big threshold because of people’s fear, anxiety and failed idealism. Can you face your own fear? Can you face your own vulnerability? Can you face the fact that perhaps you have been really wrong in your assessment of the situation, if you have given it any thought at all? People may say, “Well, ok, we get the awareness. Now what’s the next thing?” Ha! They do not see that the awareness is really big.</p>
<p>抵制干预的第一步是觉知，但由于人们的恐惧、焦虑和失败的理想主义，觉知确实是一个极大的门槛。你能面对你自身的恐惧吗？你能面对你自身的脆弱性吗？你能面对这样一个事实：如果你真的认真思考过，你对形势的评估或许真的错了吗？人们可能会说：“好吧，我们获得了觉知。接下来是什么？” 哈！他们没有看见觉知的重要性。</p>
<p>The next step is you have to create a Greater Community perspective in the way you look at yourself and in the way that you look at your world. Do you think humanity would be destroying the resources of the world if it could recognize that preserving and sustaining these resources is the very thing that will preserve human freedom in the future? If humanity loses its ability to sustain itself and becomes dependent upon foreign powers for not just advanced technology but for even basic resources, you will lose your freedom.</p>
<p>下一步是，你必须观察你自己和看待世界的方式，创造一种大社区视角。如果人类能够认识到，保护和维系这些资源正是维护人类未来自由的关键，你认为人类还会摧毁世界资源吗？如果人类失去了自给自足的能力，变得不仅在先进技术上，甚至在基本资源上都依赖于外来势力，那么你们将失去自由。</p>
<p>Perhaps you may say, “Oh, I don’t believe it. We wouldn’t lose our freedom.” But if you think about it objectively, you will see that you will lose your freedom. Either overtly or subtly, you would become reliant upon other races in the universe, and they would determine the terms of engagement. They would control your world.</p>
<p>或许你会说：“哦，我不相信它。我们不会失去自由。”但如果你客观地思考，你就会看见，你们会失去自由。无论明里暗里，你们都会变得依赖宇宙中的其他种族，而他们会决定你们的交往条件。他们会控制你们的世界。</p>
<p>Yet because they do not want to create a human revolution, they will attempt to control your world in such a way that it would be acceptable to people to be controlled. That is why the Intervention that is occurring today is so devious and is being carried out so carefully over time. If they came here in force, everyone would just react and there would be huge warfare and the world’s resources would be severely damaged. There would be no human workforce here that would be either willing or able to help the intervening races, and the whole project would be spoiled.</p>
<p>然而，因为他们不想引发一场人类革命，他们将试图以一种人们能够接受的方式控制你们的世界。正因如此，当今正在发生的干预是如此狡猾，并且随着时间的推移而如此谨慎地进行。如果他们强行来到这里，每个人都会做出反应，将会发生大规模战争，世界资源将遭到严重破坏。这里将没有任何人类劳动力愿意或能够帮助干预种族，整个项目将被破坏。</p>
<p>You must gain a Greater Community perspective. You are a human being living in this world. This world is unprotected. It is valuable. It is sought by others. Intervention by other races will increase over time. How will you defend your borders? How will you be able to determine who is here and why they are here and what they are doing? This cannot be the privilege of secret groups and secret governments.</p>
<p>你必须获得一种大社区视角。你是生活在这个世界上的人类。这个世界没有受到保护。它很宝贵。它被他人所追求。其他种族的干预将随着时间的推移而增加。你们将如何保卫你们的边界？你们将如何能够确定谁在这里，他们为何在这里，以及他们在做什么？这不能成为秘密团体和秘密政府的特权。</p>
<p>Humanity has to grow up and outgrow its childish self-preoccupations. It has to outgrow its adolescent fantasies about itself and about life and become realistic. Otherwise, the Intervention will continue, and your world will gradually become governed by foreign powers. And where will you go then with your complaints, your protest and your outrage? It is for this reason that gaining the awareness and a Greater Community perspective is critical because without these, you cannot even take the next step.</p>
<p>人类必须成长，超越其幼稚的自我执着。人类必须超越它对自身和对生命的青春期幻想，变得现实起来。否则，干预将继续，你们的世界将逐渐被外来势力统治。那时，你将带着你的抱怨、你的抗议和你的愤怒走向何方？正因为如此，获得觉知和大社区视野至关重要，因为没有这些，你甚至无法迈出下一步。</p>
<p>The third step is learning about the mental environment. The mental environment is the arena of influence. People know very little about it, but it is very important in Greater Community interactions, particularly between races or organizations that compete with each other. They have to spend a great deal of time trying to discern what the other is going to do and trying to influence the other in subtle ways. This does not happen through technology as much as it happens through consciousness, through awareness, through the projection of thought and through cunning activities.</p>
<p>第三步是学习心理环境。心理环境是影响力的舞台。人们对此知之甚少，但它在大社区互动中非常重要，尤其是在相互竞争的种族或组织之间。他们必须花费大量时间试图辨别对方将要做什么，并试图以微妙的方式影响对方。这并非通过科技实现，而是通过意识、通过觉知、通过思想的投射以及通过狡猾的活动实现。</p>
<p>Competitors generally share the same technology, so technology is not the advantage. The advantage is cunning and persuasion. You cannot see this yet because you are still thinking like you live in isolation and that the universe is governed by human principles. You do not want to think about this because you realize that you do not have these skills. And that makes you feel afraid and vulnerable. So the third step in preparation is developing skill in the mental environment. You can actually learn how to do this, but you must have the awareness and you must have a Greater Community perspective to start.</p>
<p>竞争对手通常拥有相同的技术，所以技术并非优势。优势在于狡诈和说服力。你还无法看清这一点，因为你仍然认为自己生活在孤立之中，认为宇宙是由人类的原则所统治的。你不愿思考这一点，因为你意识到你缺乏这些技能。这让你感到恐惧和脆弱。所以，准备的第三步是发展心理环境的技能。你实际上可以学习如何做到这一点，但你必须具备觉知，并且必须拥有大社区的视野才能开始。</p>
<p>The fourth thing, which really must be developed all along, is Knowledge. What is Knowledge? When we speak of Knowledge, we are not talking about perspective or bodies of information or data. We are talking about the ability to know—beyond deception, beyond appearances, beyond personal preference, beyond fear and beyond denial. The ability to know.</p>
<p>第四件事，也是真正必须始终发展的，是内识。什么是内识？当我们谈论内识时，我们谈论的不是视角，也不是信息或数据的集合。我们谈论的是认知的能力——超越欺骗，超越表象，超越个人偏好，超越恐惧，超越否认。知道的能力。</p>
<p>The Intervention has been going on actively for almost 50 years. And people who claim to be studying the UFO phenomenon, well, do they know anything yet, or are they still gathering data? “Well, we don’t want to come to any premature conclusions. You know, this is so complicated and we may never understand it!”</p>
<p>干预行动已经持续了近50年。那些声称正在研究UFO现象的人，他们现在知道些什么了吗？还是还在收集数据？“嗯，我们不想过早下结论。你知道，这太复杂了，我们可能永远都搞不清楚！”</p>
<p>What are you talking about? Is this denial? Is this the unwillingness to come to a conclusion? Or is it that people simply just don’t know? Can’t they see and feel what this really is? After 50 years, can’t they see and feel what this really is? They need more evidence? Oh, my God! How much more evidence? Another 50 years of evidence? A hundred years of evidence? 50 more years of evidence, and it will be all over then. And the conclusion you will come to will be so obvious.</p>
<p>你正在说什么？这是否认吗？这是不愿得出结论吗？还是人们根本就不知道？难道他们看不见、感觉不到真相吗？50年过去了，难道他们还看不到、感觉不到真相吗？他们需要更多证据吗？我的天哪！还需要多少证据？再过50年的证据？100年的证据？再过50年的证据，一切就都结束了。到那时，你得出的结论将显而易见。</p>
<p>It is like the person in a 30-year marriage who never should have gotten married anyway, and it takes them 30 years to figure out that really they made a mistake somewhere back there, and they really should have followed their deeper feelings and not walked down the aisle with this other person. But they have been trying to make it all right for the last 30 years.</p>
<p>它就像一个结婚30年的人，本来就不该结婚，却花了30年才明白，自己当初真的犯了错，真的应该追随内心深处的感受，而不是和另一个人走进婚姻殿堂。但过去30年来，他们一直在努力弥补。</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, you will only know what others want you to know. You will only think what others want you to think—whether it be your parents, your culture, your social group, your government, or the Greater Community. You will basically be like cattle and you will be led around, from pasture to pasture.</p>
<p>没有内识，你只会知道别人想让你知道的事情。你只会思考别人想让你思考的东西——无论是你的父母，你的文化，你的社会群体，你的政府，还是大社区。你基本上就像牲畜一样，被牵着走，从一个牧场到另一个牧场。</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, the mental environment overtakes you and overwhelms you. Knowledge is the deeper spiritual Mind within you. It is the only part of you that is unaffected by the mental environment. It is the only part of you that is free from deception and manipulation.</p>
<p>没有内识，心理环境就会掌控你、淹没你。内识是你内在更深层次的精神心灵。它是你唯一不受心理环境影响的部分。它是你唯一免受欺骗和操控的部分。</p>
<p>Do you want freedom for yourself? Then you must learn The Way of Knowledge. Otherwise, what is freedom? Having more money? Working less, having more money? Is that freedom? Look at the wealthy who have no freedom. Oh, they have lots of money, and they can go anywhere they want. They do not even have to work, some of them. Are they free? Or are they slaves to their money and their situation and their privileges and their appetites and their fears?</p>
<p>你想要为你自己获得自由吗？那么你必须学习内识之路。否则，自由是什么？拥有更多金钱？工作更少，却拥有更多金钱？这就是自由吗？看看那些没有自由的富人。哦，他们有很多钱，可以去任何他们想去的地方。有些人甚至不用工作。他们自由了吗？或者，他们是金钱、处境、特权、欲望和恐惧的奴隶？</p>
<p>The message in The Allies of Humanity Briefings is about freedom. And to have freedom, you must become aware of the Intervention. You must gain a Greater Community perspective. You must learn about the mental environment and its impact upon you. And you must develop your experience of Knowledge. Not a lot of technology here though technology may play a small role in all of this.</p>
<p>人类盟友简报中的讯息是关于自由的。为了拥有自由，你必须察觉干预。你必须获得一种大社区视角。你必须学习关于心理环境以及它对你的影响。你必须发展你的内识体验。这里没有太多科技，尽管科技可能在所有这一切中扮演着小小的角色。</p>
<p>When we speak about learning The Way of Knowledge, we are not talking about just developing intuition. That is not adequate. You must actually connect with the Knowing Mind within yourself, and this is not an easy task. There will be many who will be unwilling or unable to do this. But not everyone has to do this in order for humanity to turn the tide, to develop a Greater Community awareness and to begin to build boundaries around your world.</p>
<p>当我们谈论学习内识之路时，我们谈论的并非仅仅发展直觉。那还不够。你必须真正地与你内在的知道心灵联接，而这并非易事。会有许多人不愿或无法做到这一点。但并非每个人都必须做到这一点，人类才能扭转局势，才能发展出一种大社区觉知，并开始在你们的世界构建界限。</p>
<p>Force cannot be used to take over a planet like yours. Therefore, the Intervention must be subtle. It must be deceptive. It must be invasive. It cannot use brute force. This is good for you because you could not withstand brute force. And brute force would destroy the outcome for the visitors, if you can call them visitors. There are many reasons why they will not use it.</p>
<p>武力无法用来接管像你们这样的星球。因此，干预必须是微妙的。它必须是欺骗性的。它必须是侵略性的。它不能使用蛮力。这对你们来说是好事，因为你们无法承受蛮力。而蛮力会毁掉探访者（如果你可以称他们为来访者的话）的结局。有很多理由让他们不会使用它。</p>
<p>The Creator has responded to this great need of humanity, a need that is barely even recognized as a need, by presenting the Teaching in Greater Community Spirituality. This Teaching encompasses the reality of life in the Greater Community. Never has such a Teaching been given in the world before because it was not needed before.</p>
<p>造物主回应了人类这个伟大的需求，这个需求几乎从未被认出，他通过呈现大社区精神性教导来回应。这个教导涵盖了大社区生命的现实。此前，世界上从未有过这样的教导，因为它此前并不需要。</p>
<p>Yes, there are many spiritual teachings that emphasize the way of Knowledge to a certain degree. But a Greater Community Way of Knowledge has never been given in the world before. You need it now, however. It will not replace the world’s religions but instead give them a greater scope, a greater perspective, and a greater context in which to continue to grow, to exist and to evolve.</p>
<p>是的，有许多精神教导在一定程度上强调内识之路。但一条大社区内识之路从未被赋予过。然而，你们现在需要它。它不会取代世界宗教，而是赋予它们一个更伟大的视野、一个更伟大的视角和一个更伟大的背景，让它们在其中继续成长、生存和进化。</p>
<p>Yet it is curious that the world’s religious leaders will perhaps be the most resistant to learning a Greater Community Spirituality. To preserve their traditions, their authority and their power, they will perhaps deny the very thing that will give their tradition a future in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>然而，令人好奇的是，世界上的宗教领袖或许恰恰是最抵制学习大社区精神性的。为了维护他们的传统、他们的权威和他们的权力，他们或许会否认那些赋予他们的传统在大社区中未来的东西。</p>
<p>For without human freedom, there is no future. Without human self-determination, there is no future. And without an understanding of the Greater Community, there is no future for anyone here, not a future that you could embrace anyway.</p>
<p>因为没有人类自由，就没有未来。没有人类自决，就没有未来。没有对大社区的理解，这里的任何人都没有未来，一个无论如何都无法拥抱的未来。</p>
<p>You must see the relevance of this to yourself. All that you want out of life, all that you want to be, do and have, the Intervention could take it all away from you. Are you going to mindlessly pursue your personal goals and to hell with everything else, saying it doesn’t matter?</p>
<p>你必须看见这件事与你自己的关联。你生命中想要的一切，你想成为的人、想做的事情、想拥有的一切，干预都可能把它们全部夺走。难道你要盲目地追求你的个人目标，而把其他一切都抛在一边，说这些都不重要吗？</p>
<p>Even if the Intervention were not happening, the degradation of your natural resources and the growing population of the world would change what is available to you anyway. Some people say, “Well, I’m just going to go get what I want, and I’m not going to worry about anything else.”</p>
<p>即使干预没有发生，你们自然资源的退化和世界人口的增长也会改变你们所能拥有的一切。有些人会说：“好吧，我只想去得到我想要的东西，其他什么都不用担心。”</p>
<p>When people think like that, they are like locusts. Thrown upon the land, they are going to consume everything in sight. And they will leave a wasteland and move on until there is nowhere to move on to, and then they will all die out. Is this the promise for human advancement? To be like parasites that destroy the host and when the host dies, they all die too?</p>
<p>当人们这样想的时候，他们就像蝗虫一样。它们被扔到地上，会吞噬眼前的一切。它们会留下一片荒地，不断迁徙，直到无处可去，然后全部灭绝。这就是人类发展的承诺吗？就像寄生虫一样，摧毁宿主，宿主死了，它们也跟着一起死掉？</p>
<p>Now most people would say, “Of course not! Absolutely not!” But if their behavior is self-seeking, then this is an appropriate analogy. Interestingly enough, those who are intervening in your world view humanity as a sort of destructive force in the world that is going to destroy this fabulous place. Their attitude is, “We’re going to get in there and stop them. And if they can’t use their world properly and preserve it, well, we’ll save it for ourselves. They can work for us.”</p>
<p>现在大多数人会说：“当然不行！绝对不行！”但如果他们的行为是自私自利的，那么这个比喻就很贴切了。有趣的是，那些干预你们世界的种族，把人类视为世界上一种毁灭性的势力，会摧毁这个美好的世界。他们的态度是：“我们要进去阻止他们。如果他们不能好好使用并保护好他们的世界，那好，我们自己把它拯救出来。他们可以为我们工作。”</p>
<p>This is exactly how they think. This is their perspective. This is how you would think if you were in their place. Even with all of humanity’s great idealism, you would think like this too. “We are not going to let them destroy this place! If they can’t benefit from it, we will!” This is exactly how a human government would respond. Perhaps this is how you personally would respond.</p>
<p>他们的想法就是这样。这是他们的观点。如果你处在他们的位置，你也会这么想。即使人类拥有伟大的理想主义，你也会这么想。“我们不会让他们毁掉这个地方！如果他们不能从中受益，我们就会！”这正是人类政府的反应。或许，你个人也会如此回应。</p>
<p>Those intervening are not evil. They simply see the situation from a certain perspective. They are not guided by Knowledge or spirituality, or they would not be intervening here.</p>
<p>那些介入的种族并非邪恶。他们只是从特定视角看待局势。他们并非受内识或精神性的指引，否则他们就不会在此介入。</p>
<p>There are people in the world who want the Intervention because they think that the alien races here will somehow save humanity from itself. They believe in the same perspective as the alien races themselves. Sometimes they reach this conclusion within themselves. Sometimes this thinking is encouraged through the Intervention. Yet the result is the same—loss of human freedom and self-determination, which will be very complete. If you think about this, you will realize that this is the worst possible scenario for you.</p>
<p>世界上有些人想要干预，因为他们认为这里的外星种族会以某种方式拯救人类于水火之中。他们和外星种族持有同样的视角。有时他们在内心深处得出这种结论。有时这种想法通过干预得到鼓励。然而结果是一样的——人类自由和自主权的彻底丧失。如果你思考这一点，你就会意识到这对你来说是最糟糕的可能情景。</p>
<p>This is why the Creator is providing the preparation for the Greater Community. This is why it must be learned and taken to heart. This is why the awareness must be gained.</p>
<p>正因如此，造物主正在为大社区提供准备。正因如此，你必须学习并铭记于心。正因如此，你必须获得觉知。</p>
<p>People must face their fear and anxiety and realize the situation they are in. They must gain a new understanding of where they stand in the universe and their role and responsibility as the native peoples and stewards of this world. They must exercise the power that they have individually and collectively to preserve their own native grounds.</p>
<p>人们必须直面恐惧和焦虑，认清自身的处境。他们必须重新认识他们在宇宙中的位置，以及作为这个世界原住民和守护者的角色和责任。他们必须运用他们自身拥有的个体和集体力量，守护他们自己的家园。</p>
<p>Your spiritual understanding needs to change for you to realize what God has given humanity to preserve the advancement of human freedom, understanding and cooperation. In the universe, these must be defended. You need to recognize that you have to outgrow your fantasies and your ideals, even your demands and expectations, to see the situation clearly. The Creator has asked the allies of humanity to be observers, to provide commentary and to present their message so that humanity can begin to gain a Greater Community perspective.</p>
<p>你的精神理解需要改变，才能认识到上帝赋予人类什么，以维护人类自由、理解与合作的进步。在宇宙中，这些必须得到捍卫。你需要认识到，你必须超越你的幻想和理想，甚至你的要求和期望，才能清晰地看清现状。造物主要求人类的盟友成为观察者，提供评论，并呈现他们的讯息，这样人类才能开始获得一种大社区视野。</p>
<p>God has given a teaching about the mental environment and Knowledge. Learning The Way of Knowledge is an individual spiritual journey for each person. Knowledge is the greater Intelligence that lives within you. It knows how to deal with the Greater Community. Knowledge is not governed by human beliefs, assumptions, preoccupations, deceptions, ideals or ambitions. It is pure. It is the holy part of you. It knows.</p>
<p>上帝赋予了关于心理环境和内识的教导。学习内识之路是每个人的一次个人精神旅程。内识是活在你内在的更伟大智能。它知道如何应对大社区。内识不受人类信仰、假设、执念、欺骗、理想或野心的支配。它是纯粹的。它是你神圣的部分。它知晓。</p>
<p>Your mind thinks. Knowledge knows. The gulf between them seems great, but they can be united together. And this is the ultimate goal of your spiritual development. This gift of Greater Community Spirituality is meant to give human freedom a real foundation, to empower the individual, to empower the group, to empower humanity, which is losing power every day to those who are intervening in the world.</p>
<p>你的心灵思考。内识知道。它们之间的鸿沟看似巨大，但它们可以团结在一起。而这正是你精神发展的终极目标。大社区精神性的这份礼物旨在赋予人类自由一个真正的基础，授权个体，授权群体，授权人类——人类的力量每天都在被那些干预世界的种族夺走。</p>
<p>We hope this discourse provides clarity, but it is really only the first step. Do not think you can read this discourse or read The Allies of Humanity Briefings and say, “Well, I understand now. I know what to do.” You do not yet know what to do. But you may be beginning to gain an understanding. If this stirs something within you deeply, then Knowledge within you is being activated. But there is much to learn ahead.</p>
<p>我们希望这篇论述能够带来清晰性，但这实际上只是第一步。不要认为你读了这篇论述或人类盟友的简报就能说：“好吧，我现在理解了。我知道该怎么做了。”你还不知道该怎么做。但你或许正在开始获得理解。如果这深深地触动了你内在的内识，那么你内在的内识正在被激活。但前方还有很多事情需要学习。</p>
<p>Humanity’s encounter with the realities of life beyond this world is a new threshold, perhaps the greatest threshold that humanity has ever faced. The learning will have to be rapid. Do not think you already know or understand. You do not. You may have an idea. You may experience a resonance with this message. You may feel it is important, but you still have to train and prepare.</p>
<p>人类与这个世界之外的生命现实的相遇，是一道新的门槛，或许是人类迄今面临的最大门槛。学习必须迅速。不要认为你已经知道或理解了。你并非如此。你可能有所领悟。你可能对这条讯息产生共鸣。你可能觉得它很重要，但你仍然需要训练和准备。</p>
<p>You do not climb the highest mountain in the world because you love mountains. You do not climb the highest mountain in the world because you have hiking boots. You have to train and prepare, or you will not make it.</p>
<p>你不会因为热爱大山而攀登世界的最高峰。你也不会因为拥有登山靴而攀登世界的最高峰。你必须训练和准备，否则你将无法成功。</p>
<p>This is the challenge of your time. This is the greatness of your time. This is where you will find your own greatness. You will never find your greatness in your individual pursuits, for there is no greatness there. You will only find your greatness in responding to a real need in the world and to the calling that lives within you even at this moment. This is the great situation that will bring out the greatness in you, if you can respond.</p>
<p>这是你们时代的挑战。这是你们时代的伟大之处。这是你将发现你自身伟大之处的地方。你永远不会在个人的追求中找到你的伟大，因为那里没有伟大。你只有在回应世界上一个真正的需求，以及回应即使在此刻也活在你内在的召唤时，才会发现你的伟大。这是一个将激发出你内在伟大的伟大境况，如果你可以回应。</p>
