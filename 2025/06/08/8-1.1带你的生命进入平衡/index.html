<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 6, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 10 月 6 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bringing your life into balance means that you are addressing all of the key areas of your life, and you are doing this in such a way that your life can establish a stable continuity in the face of changing circumstances.</p>
<p>带你的生命进入平衡意味着你正在解决生命中的所有关键领域，并且你正在以这样的方式做到这一点，即你的生命可以在不断变化的情况下建立稳定的连续性。</p>
<p>When most people think of balancing their life, they are really thinking of catching up, of trying to deal with something that has been neglected. Therefore, they have to put a great deal of energy into one area of their life just to correct the problems there, to plug up the leaks, to deal with an emerging difficulty. But that does not mean that they are achieving a balance.</p>
<p>当大多数人想平衡他们的生命时，其实是在想着弥补，想着努力处理那些被忽视的事情。因此，他们不得不在他们生命的某个领域投入大量精力，只是为了纠正那里的问题，堵住漏洞，应对新出现的困难。但这并不意味着他们已经达到了平衡。</p>
<p>First, it is necessary to realize that a balance is really just a range of experience. It is not one fine point that you achieve and then you are able to maintain from there on.</p>
<p>首先，有必要认识到，平衡实际上只是一种经验的范围。它并不是你达到了一个微妙的点，然后你就可以从此保持下去。</p>
<p>A balance is something that requires constant adjustments. Like sailing a ship out on the open ocean, you are constantly having to deal with changing circumstances. You are constantly dealing with going off course in your life, having to readjust your navigation to bring yourself back on course and to re-establish balance.</p>
<p>平衡需要不断调整。就像在浩瀚大海上航行的船，你必须不断应对不断变化的环境。你不断应对人生中偏离航向的危险，需要重新调整航向，带你自己回到正轨，重新建立平衡。</p>
<p>Life is always moving, and so balance can never be a static state or one kind of experience only. If the fulcrum point upon which you are trying to balance never moved or never changed, then you could over time establish a very stable equilibrium. But that fulcrum point is constantly moving, and so balance is important.</p>
<p>生命总是在运动，因此平衡绝非静止状态，也绝非仅仅一种体验。如果你试图保持平衡的支点从未移动或改变，那么随着时间的推移，你就能建立一个非常稳定的平衡。但这个支点总是在移动，因此平衡至关重要。</p>
<p>To be in a position to experience balance on an ongoing basis, you must be building the Four Pillars of your life—the Pillar of Relationships, the Pillar of Work and Providership, the Pillar of Health and the Pillar of Spiritual Development. Like the four legs of a table, the Four Pillars of your life uphold your life. And if these Pillars are built sufficiently, giving you stability, then you can assume greater tasks. You can experience a greater purpose. You can achieve greater things.</p>
<p>为了能够持续体验平衡，你必须构建你生命的四大支柱——关系支柱、工作与供养支柱、健康支柱以及精神发展支柱。如同桌子的四条腿，你生命的四大支柱支撑着你的生命。如果这些支柱得到充分构建，赋予你稳定性，那么你就能承担更伟大的任务。你就能体验到更伟大的目的。你就能成就更伟大的事。</p>
<p>A table is a solid object. It is standing on solid ground. It is not moving, in most cases. But life is not just a stationary object, and it is always moving. The balance is elusive and even out of reach for people because they have not built the foundation that is necessary in order to achieve and experience a greater balance in life.</p>
<p>桌子是固体，立在坚实的地面上，大多数情况下静止不动。但生命并非静止不动，它始终在运动。平衡难以捉摸，甚至对人们来说遥不可及，因为他们尚未建立实现和体验更伟大生命平衡所必需的基础。</p>
<p>Here the Pillars are very important. Most people put a lot of energy into one Pillar alone, to the neglect of the others. As a result, the Pillars that have not been built are always undermining their progress and their well-being and their stability, making balance an elusive and impossible achievement.</p>
<p>在这里，支柱非常重要。大多数人只把大量精力投入到某个支柱上，而忽略了其他支柱。结果，那些尚未建成的支柱总是在损害他们的进步、福祉和稳定，使平衡成为难以捉摸、不可能实现的成就。</p>
<p>Some people give everything to their relationships: the pursuit of relationships, negotiation in relationships, the management of relationships. Meanwhile, the Pillar of Work is undeveloped, they are financially unstable, their personal health can be neglected, even completely, and perhaps they have no inner life and are not developing their awareness of the deeper spiritual power within themselves.</p>
<p>有些人为了人际关系倾尽所有：追求人际关系、在人际关系中协商、管理人际关系。与此同时，他们的工作支柱尚未开发，经济不稳定，个人健康可能被忽视，甚至完全被忽视，或许他们缺乏内在生命，也从未培养对他们内在更深层次精神力量的觉知。</p>
<p>Then there are others who give everything to their career and to the accumulation of wealth, or who are fascinated by the economy through their investments and so forth. Likewise, they can sacrifice the quality of their relationships, allowing their marriage to deteriorate, being estranged even from their own children. They may have no inner life at all, and their health may be in great jeopardy.</p>
<p>还有一些人，他们把一切都交给了事业和财富的积累，或者通过投资等方式沉迷于经济。同样，他们也可能牺牲人际关系的质量，导致婚姻破裂，甚至与他们自己的孩子疏远。他们可能完全没有内心世界，健康也可能面临巨大的危​​险。</p>
<p>Over time, those Pillars that have not been built will undermine your progress. Even if you are able to keep going, they will erode away your experience of well-being. For if you do not have healthy, meaningful relationships, then that will erode away your sense of well-being. If you do not have financial stability, that will erode away your well-being and your stability. If you do not have good health that can be sustained into the future, this will undermine your well-being and can even undermine your entire life. If your Pillar of Spiritual Development is neglected, this will rob you of the power of Knowledge within yourself—the ability to see, to know and to act with certainty. It will make you a stranger unto yourself, and as a result a stranger unto others.</p>
<p>随着时间的推移，那些尚未建立的支柱将损害你的进步。即使你能够继续前进，它们也会侵蚀你的福祉体验。因为如果你没有健康、有意义的关系，那么这将侵蚀你的幸福。如果你没有经济的稳定，那么这将侵蚀你的福祉和你的稳定。如果你没有能够持续到未来的良好健康，那么这将损害你的福祉，甚至可能损害你的整个人生。如果你的精神发展支柱被忽视，这将夺走你内在内识的力量——去看见、去知道并带着确定性行动的能力。这将使你对你自己成为一个陌生人，并因此对他人成为一个陌生人。</p>
<p>You must be operating in all four of these arenas. And when you look at your life objectively, you will see that everything you do falls into one or more of these Pillars. So if you are really engaged with your life to this degree, you cannot afford to be eccentric. You cannot afford to be self-obsessed. You cannot be addicted to anything because you are giving your attention to so many things at once.</p>
<p>你必须在这四个领域都运作。当你客观地审视你的生命时，你会发现你所做的一切都落入了这些支柱中的一个或多个。所以，如果你真的如此投入你的生命，你就承受不起古怪。你承受不起自我痴迷。你不会对任何事上瘾，因为你同时关注着太多的事情。</p>
<p>It is like, again, sailing a great ship at sea. It has complex rigging, complex sails. You have to manage this instrument, this boat that is taking you across very unpredictable circumstances, called life.</p>
<p>它就像驾驶一艘巨轮在海上航行。它有复杂的索具，复杂的船帆。你必须驾驭这艘工具，这艘载你穿越难以预测的境遇的船，它被称为生命。</p>
<p>Here if you are paying attention to your environment, if you are paying attention to your own condition, if you are paying attention to the Four Pillars of your life, you do not have time to be self-obsessed or obsessive about anything.</p>
<p>在这里，如果你关注你的环境，如果你关注你自身的状况，如果你关注你生命的四大支柱，你就没有时间自我痴迷或对任何事情着迷。</p>
<p>Problems will arise that will require extra effort, of course. Unforeseen difficulties will occur, problems in relationships, even personal loss and tragedy. But you can weather these storms if you have the strength of these Pillars. You will have sufficient support. You will have sufficient mental and physical health. You will have sufficient financial stability, not to be overwhelmed by the events of life.</p>
<p>当然，会出现一些需要额外努力的问题。不可预见的困难将会发生，人际关系出现问题，甚至个人的损失和悲剧。但如果你拥有这些支柱的力量，你就能渡过这些风暴。你将获得足够的支持。你将拥有足够的身心健康。你将拥有足够的经济稳定，不会被生命中的事件压垮。</p>
<p>This has now become ever more important because Great Waves of change are coming over the horizon—converging, creating a set of currents and cross-currents that will be very difficult to navigate, more difficult than even the normal parameters of life. This will require a greater stability, a greater self-awareness, a greater responsibility, a greater caution and care.</p>
<p>这现在变得比以往任何时候都更加重要，因为变革的巨浪正在地平线上涌来——它们汇聚在一起，创造出一系列非常难以驾驭的潮流和逆流，甚至比生命的正常参数还要困难。这将需要一种更伟大的稳定性，一种更伟大的自我觉知，一种更伟大的责任感，一种更伟大的谨慎和关怀。</p>
<p>You cannot be fooling around in the face of these Great Waves, for they are powerful. And you cannot run away from them, for they will affect everyone.</p>
<p>面对这些巨浪，你不能敷衍，因为它们威力巨大。你也不能逃避，因为它们会影响到每个人。</p>
<p>Great Waves of change are largely the result of humanity’s misuse and overuse of the world—depleting resources, degrading environment, violent weather, growing economic and political instability, and the risk of conflict and war.</p>
<p>变革的巨浪很大程度上是人类对世界的错误使用和过度使用的结果——资源枯竭、环境恶化、恶劣天气、经济和政治不稳定性增加、冲突和战争的风险。</p>
<p>The New Message from God that has been sent into the world reveals the real nature and the potential of these Great Waves of change, and why they cannot be resolved with simple solutions. For they will change the landscape of humanity, and they will change the conditions of your life.</p>
<p>来自上帝发送给世界的新讯息揭示了这些变革巨浪的实际自然和潜力，以及为什么它们无法用简单的解决方案来解决。因为它们将改变人类的面貌，它们将改变你们生命的状况。</p>
<p>Humanity is heading into stormy waters and times of great upheaval and uncertainty. Many people do not have the stability to be able to maintain themselves in any kind of healthy manner in the face of these Great Waves of change. For they have not built the Pillars of their life, and they have not looked carefully and objectively and courageously to see what is coming over the horizon, to see what they will have to contend with, and what they must change and focus upon in their life.</p>
<p>人类正在走向风暴的水域、巨大的动荡与不确定性的时代。面对这些巨大的变革浪潮，许多人无法以任何健康的方式保持他们自身的稳定。因为他们没有构建他们生命的支柱，他们没有仔细、客观、勇敢地看向地平线上即将发生的事情，没有看到他们将不得不面对的一切，看向他们在生命中必须改变和聚焦的内识。</p>
<p>Here the importance of looking ahead is very significant. You do not want to be caught off guard by great events. And great events always have signs preceding them, giving warning, giving an alert.</p>
<p>在这里，展望未来至关重要。你不想被重大事件打个措手不及。重大事件总是有预兆，发出警告，发出警报。</p>
<p>Here life is telling you what is coming. It is warning you of danger. It is alerting you to the presence of conflicting forces and changing circumstances. It is giving you time to reconsider your position and to change your position if that is necessary.</p>
<p>在这里，生命正在告诉你即将发生的事情。它正在警告你危险。它正在提醒你注意冲突力量和变化境况的存在。它正在给你时间重新考虑你的位置，并在必要时改变你的位置。</p>
<p>But people are not looking. They are in avoidance. Perhaps they feel overwhelmed already and think they cannot take on any more concern. But really this is just an excuse to not pay attention to your life and to your environment.</p>
<p>但人们并没有关注。他们在逃避。也许他们已经感到力不从心，认为他们无法承担更多的责任。但实际上，这只是一个借口，让你不去关注你的生命和周围的环境。</p>
<p>Your environment includes not only the natural world and all of its forces, but also your social and economic environment as well. These will undergo profound and at times wrenching change.</p>
<p>你们的环境不仅包括自然界及其所有的驱动力，还包括你们的社会和经济环境。这些都将经历深刻的、有时甚至是痛苦的变革。</p>
<p>So balance here becomes something that comes after one has built a strong enough foundation within the Four Pillars of their lives. Otherwise, balance is kind of an elusive dream. It is something that will take your eyes off of the horizon. You will become only concerned with what you have now, trying to balance that, and not become mindful of the great change that is approaching.</p>
<p>因此，平衡是人们在生命的四大支柱中建立足够坚实基础之后才能实现的。否则，平衡就像一个难以捉摸的梦。它会让你的目光远离地平线。你会只关心你现在拥有的一切，努力去平衡它们，而忽略了即将到来的变革巨浪。</p>
<p>Look at the animals in nature. They are always watching. They have to do this in order to maintain safety in their environments and to be alert to the presence of danger or changing circumstances. No matter what they are doing, they are always watching. They are always alert.</p>
<p>看看大自然中的动物。它们总是在观察。它们必须这样做才能维护周围环境的安全，并对危险的存在或不断变化的环境保持警惕。无论它们在做什么，它们总是在观察。它们总是保持警惕。</p>
<p>But, strangely, people—who have the greatest intelligence—are not watching and are not alert. They are trying to establish balance within their own current circumstances without realizing they must build a stronger foundation, and without realizing that their environment is changing.</p>
<p>但奇怪的是，那些拥有最强智能的人却没有观察，也没有警觉。他们试图在他们自身的现状中建立平衡，却没有意识到必须建立更坚实的基础，也没有意识到他们的环境正在发生变化。</p>
<p>This neglect of one’s environment is very tragic because people will fail for unforeseen reasons. They will lose their employment. They will lose, perhaps, their homes—to forces they did not foresee and did not anticipate. They were trying to establish balance, but they were not paying attention to the larger environment around them. And when you are not paying attention, you are not seeing the signs. You are not allowing life to alert you and educate you about what is coming and what is taking place around you.</p>
<p>这种对自身环境的忽视是非常悲惨的，因为人们会因为无法预见的原因而失败。他们会失去工作。他们或许会失去家园——因为他们没有预见到、没有预料到的力量。他们试图建立平衡，但却没有关注周围更广阔的环境。而当你不关注时，你就看不到迹象。你没有让生命警示你，教育你即将发生的事情以及你周围正在发生的事情。</p>
<p>Real balance here means that no matter what happens, you are able to stay afloat. You are able to maintain your inner stability. You are able to maintain objectivity and clarity about what you are doing and what you may have to do next.</p>
<p>真正的平衡意味着无论发生什么，你都能保持平衡。你能够保持内在的稳定。你能够客观、清晰地看待你正在做的事情以及接下来可能要做的事情。</p>
<p>In light of this, most people are very ill prepared for the Great Waves of change. Even in the wealthy nations you see this, especially. People are obsessed in one part of their life, or trying to remediate another part of their life, or trying to deal with emerging problems all around them. But they do not have a strong foundation, and often they are not really paying attention to their environment.</p>
<p>鉴于此，大多数人对变革巨浪的准备非常不足。即使在富裕国家，你也尤其会看到这种情况。人们沉迷于他们生命的某个部分，或试图补救生命的另一部分，或试图应对周围不断涌现的问题。但他们缺乏坚实的基础，而且往往没有真正关注他们的环境。</p>
<p>Here if you are trying to repair a relationship that is in jeopardy, you may ignore the fact that your economic reality is falling apart. Here while you are trying to either become beautiful and magnificent in the area of health, or trying to deal with serious illness or a health problem, you may fail to see that your career or your employment will not survive the great economic changes that are coming. And all of a sudden you find yourself in financial difficulty.</p>
<p>如果你正试图修复一段岌岌可危的关系，你可能会忽略你的经济状况正在崩溃的事实。如果你正努力让你的健康变得光彩照人，或者努力应对严重的疾病或健康问题，你可能会忽略你的事业或工作将无法承受即将到来的巨大经济改变。突然之间，你就会发现你自己陷入了财务困境。</p>
<p>It takes a lot of work to build and maintain the Four Pillars of your life. But this work is healthy and redemptive. It keeps you out of trouble with yourself. It builds real stability and solidity in one’s life. And it will enable you to withstand great change and difficulty. It will enable you to withstand personal loss and confusion.</p>
<p>建立并维持生命的四大支柱需要付出很多努力。但这些努力是健康的，具有救赎作用。它能让你远离自我困扰，在生命中建立真正的稳定与坚固。它能帮助你经受住巨大的变化和困难，也能让你经受住个人的损失和困惑。</p>
<p>It is really unfortunate that this teaching on personal awareness and responsibility is not emphasized throughout children’s education. People are encouraged to pursue their dreams, to follow whatever they want that fascinates them or that they think will make them wealthy or successful.</p>
<p>令人遗憾的是，这种关于个人觉知和责任的教育并没有在儿童教育中得到强调。人们被鼓励去追求他们的梦想，去追寻任何令他们着迷或认为能让他们致富或成功的事情。</p>
<p>They are not taught a wise approach to life. They are not taught about the meaning of their social and financial environment. They are not connected to the natural forces of the world.</p>
<p>他们没有学会如何明智地对待生命。他们没有学会如何理解他们的社会和经济环境。他们没有与世界的自然力量建立联系。</p>
<p>So they launch themselves obsessively on their pursuit of love, or their pursuit of wealth, and they do not know how to balance their lives. And they are not encouraged to restrain themselves from overinvesting in any area of their lives.</p>
<p>因此，他们痴迷地追求爱情或财富，却不知道如何平衡生命。他们也不被鼓励克制他们自己，不要在生命中的任何领域过度投资。</p>
<p>People have spent too much. They have overextended themselves. And now the Great Waves are coming, affecting the economic stability of nations. People suddenly find themselves in jeopardy, overwhelmed by their circumstances—circumstances that could have been foreseen, for life has been giving you the signs.</p>
<p>人们挥霍过度。他们过度扩张。如今，巨浪正在袭来，影响着各国的经济稳定。人们突然发现他们自己身处险境，被他们的处境压垮——这些处境原本是可以预见的，因为生命一直在给予你们迹象。</p>
<p>It takes a lot of work to be aware of all these things. But this awareness gives you strength. And if you are building your Pillar of Spiritual Development, you are gaining a greater connection to a deeper and wiser Mind within yourself—a Mind that is here to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to your fulfillment in service to the world.</p>
<p>要觉察所有这些迹象需要付出很多努力。但这种觉知会赋予你实力。如果你正在构建你的精神发展支柱，你就会与你内在一种更深层次、更明智的心灵建立一种更伟大的连接——这个心灵在此指引你、保护你，并引领你通过服务世界获得成就。</p>
<p>When you are maintaining a Four Pillars approach to life, you are allowing this Knowledge to give you the signs that you need and the indicators that you need in every aspect of your life, for you are looking at all of them at once. Here your natural inner guidance has the optimum opportunity to reveal itself to you and to be of service to you in your life.</p>
<p>当你秉持四大支柱的人生观时，你就是在让这内识赋予你生命中各个面向所需的迹象和指示，因为你正在同时审视它们。在这里，你自然的内在指引拥有最佳的机会向你展现，并在你的生命中为你服务。</p>
<p>Life in the world at this time is complex and can be very confusing. But this is your life, and this is the world that you have created with everyone else. But within you there is something very fundamental and very simple.</p>
<p>在这个时间，世界的生命是复杂的，可能非常令人困惑。但这就是你的生命，这是你和其他人共同创造的世界。但在你的内心深处，有一种非常根本且非常简单的东西。</p>
<p>It is the power and the presence of Knowledge. It is not confused or perplexed by the world around you. It is not seduced or intrigued by the world around you. It is not impressed by beauty, wealth or charm. It is not seduced by the desire for power, or by the fear of loss. It remains pure and potent within you, but it exists beyond the realm and the reach of your intellect.</p>
<p>它是内识的力量和存在。它不会被你周遭的世界所困惑或迷惑。它不会被你周遭的世界所诱惑或迷惑。它不会被美貌、财富或魅力所打动。它不会被对权力的渴望，或对失去的恐惧所诱惑。它依然纯粹而强大地存在于你的内在，但它存在于你的智力的领域和范围之外。</p>
<p>For in truth, you have two minds. You have the social mind that has been conditioned by the world, where you live every day. And then you have a deeper Mind that was created by God, that represents your true existence and the greater wisdom that God has given you to be able to navigate life in this world and all of the change that is coming to this world.</p>
<p>因为真理是，你有两个心灵。你有一个被你每天生活的世界所熏陶的社会心灵。然后你还有一个由上帝创造的更深层次的心灵，它代表着你真正的存在，以及上帝赋予你的更伟大智慧，使你能够驾驭这个世界上的生命，以及即将降临这个世界的所有变化。</p>
<p>You must take the steps to this Knowledge. You must connect your thinking mind with the deeper Mind within you if you are to benefit from its guidance, its wisdom and its power. It will bring you back into the world and require you to deal with the Four Pillars of your life, even if you have been avoiding any of them for a long time.</p>
<p>你必须开展这个内识的步骤。你必须将你的思考心灵与你内在的更深层次的心灵连接起来，这样你才能受益于它的指引、它的智慧和它的力量。它将带你回归世界，要求你应对你生命的四大支柱，即使你长久以来一直在回避它们中的任何一个。</p>
<p>You cannot lose yourself in your personal pursuits. You cannot lose yourself in anything here within the context of the Four Pillars of your life. And this is what enables you to become clear and aware and effective.</p>
<p>你不能迷失于个人追求。你不能迷失于你生命四大支柱框架内的任何事物。这能让你变得清晰、察觉、有效。</p>
<p>So many people are lost in their hobbies, their interests, the difficulties in their relationships. Or they have just given themselves inordinately to one of their Pillars—not paying attention to the rest of their life, not bringing awareness, not making adjustments in their position, not seeing what is coming over the horizon.</p>
<p>许多人迷失在他们的爱好、兴趣和人际关系的困境中。或者他们只是过度地把他们自己交给了他们的某个支柱——没有关注他们生命的其他部分，没有带来觉知，没有调整他们的位置，没有看到地平线上正在发生的事情。</p>
<p>It is as if the weather were changing dramatically. All the creatures in the woods are paying attention, but people are not noticing and are just going about whatever they are doing. This is clearly not intelligent. It is not using one’s intelligence. But you see this all around you, and you must correct this within yourself.</p>
<p>它就好像天气骤变。森林里的所有生物都注意到了，但人们却浑然不觉，只是继续做着他们该做的事情。这显然不明智，没有运用智能。但你周围到处都能看到这种情况，你必须在你自己的内在纠正它。</p>
<p>You have to build the Four Pillars of your life, and you have to balance these Pillars. At any given time, one may require more attention than another, but you cannot lose sight of the others.</p>
<p>你必须构建生命的四大支柱，并平衡它们。在任何时候，其中一个支柱可能比其他支柱更需要关注，但你不能忽视其他支柱。</p>
<p>It is like having four children. Maybe at any one time one of them is having difficulty or needs extra care and attention, but it does not mean you neglect the other three. Each is important. Each requires observation and clarity and consideration.</p>
<p>它就像养育四个孩子。也许在某个时候，其中一个孩子会遇到困难，或者需要额外的照顾和关注，但这并不意味着你会忽视其他三个孩子。他们每个人都很重要，都需要观察、清晰和深思。</p>
<p>People who are looking after four children effectively do not have time to fall into difficulty with themselves. They are busy, yes. But this also leads to a kind of stability and health.</p>
<p>有效地照顾四个孩子的人没有时间让他们自己陷入困境。他们确实很忙。但这也带来了一种稳定和健康。</p>
<p>Your four children right now are the Four Pillars of your life. Do not lose contact with any of them. Build your relationship with every one of them. And maintain a balance between them.</p>
<p>你的四个孩子现在是你生命的四大支柱。不要和他们中的任何一个失去联系。和他们每一个人建立关系，并保持他们之间的平衡。</p>
<p>Now this Teaching in the Four Pillars of your life is greater than you might think at the outset. For when you are considering the Pillar of Relationships, you begin to see that everything is relationships.</p>
<p>现在，你生命的四大支柱的这门教导比你最初想象的要伟大得多。因为当你思考关系这个支柱时，你开始看见一切都是关系。</p>
<p>You have a relationship with your body. You have a relationship with your mind. You have a relationship with your home, with your work. You have a relationship with the financial reality you live within, and the social reality. You have a relationship with the natural world. You have a relationship with the deeper Knowledge within yourself. So you can begin to see here that relationships is far more encompassing than just your association with a few people. It is very great.</p>
<p>你与你的身体有关系。你与你的心灵有关系。你与你的家、你的工作有关系。你与你身处其中的财务现实以及社会现实有关系。你与自然界有关系。你与你内在的更深层次的内识有关系。因此，你在此能够开始看见，关系远比你与少数人的交往更为包罗万象。它非常伟大。</p>
<p>The more you are dealing effectively with your relationships—attending to them, observing them, learning what they are telling you, responding appropriately, making adjustments in your thinking and in your behavior—the more you do this, the less you will have time to dwell on your personal problems, or your sense of inadequacy, or your regrets from the past, your unforgiveness with other people, or low self-esteem. These problems may reside within you to a certain degree, but you will not have time to amplify them or allow them to overtake you if you are truly engaged in building the foundation of your life.</p>
<p>你越有效地处理你的关系——关注它们，观察它们，学习它们告诉你什么，做出恰当的回应，调整你的思维和行为——你这样做得越多，你就越没有时间纠结于你的个人问题，或者你的不足感，或者你对过去的悔恨，你对他人的不宽恕，或者低自尊。这些问题可能在某种程度上存在于你的内心，但如果你真正致力于构建你生命的基础，你就没有时间去放大它们，或者让它们占据你的内心。</p>
<p>If you are going to sail your ship on the open ocean, it had better be well provisioned. It had better be sound. You had better know it intimately, and pay attention to it constantly. Like the animals watching their environment and the changing climate, you are watching your circumstances—not with fantasy, not with dread, but with a greater objectivity.</p>
<p>如果你要驾驶你的船在公海上航行，它最好配备充足的补给。它最好是坚固的。你最好对它了如指掌，并时刻关注它。就像动物观察它们的环境和气候变化一样，你也在观察你的处境——不是带着幻想，不是带着恐惧，而是带着更客观的态度。</p>
<p>The New Message from God that is being sent into the world has given a great warning about the Great Waves of change, and has provided a set of guidelines for people to use, to re-evaluate their lives and their circumstances and their position in their environment overall. This represents a deep evaluation, and it is of the greatest importance.</p>
<p>上帝向世界发送的新讯息，对变革的巨浪发出了一个重大警示，并提供了一系列指导方针供人们运用，重新评估他们的生命、他们的境遇以及他们在整体环境中的位置。这代表着一种深度的评估，它具有极其重要的意义。</p>
<p>So many people today will really fail and lose their stability in the face of the Great Waves of change if they do not prepare accordingly and if they are caught unawares. That is why the warning must be given, and given very strongly so that people have time to come to terms with the changing conditions of their lives; so that people will have time to begin to alter their position, to change their circumstances, to re-evaluate their assumptions and their beliefs; and to respond to the reality of change around them and even within themselves.</p>
<p>当今如此多的人，如果不进行相应的准备，如果他们措手不及，在面对变革的巨浪时，将会真正失败，失去他们的稳定。正因为如此，必须发出警告，而且要非常强烈地发出警告，以便人们有时间去适应他们生命中不断变化的状况；以便人们有时间开始改变他们的立场，改变他们的境况，重新评估他们的假设和他们的信仰；并回应他们周围乃至他们自身内部改变的现实。</p>
<p>Change is difficult to bring about. It requires courage. It requires extra effort. It requires taking risks. It requires that you think independently and not just follow along with what everyone else believes or assumes. But it is this ability that returns strength to you and the power and the presence of Knowledge in your own awareness.</p>
<p>改变很难实现。它需要勇气。它需要额外的努力。它需要承担风险。它需要你独立思考，而不是仅仅追随其他人的信念或假设。但正是这种能力将力量归还给你，以及在你自身觉知中的内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>Then when great storms come in the world, or great change occurs in your life and circumstances, you are in the best position to weather them and even to benefit from them. You have diminished your risk to change. You have diminished your risk to even calamitous change. You have broken free from the obsessive nature of people’s preoccupations.</p>
<p>这样，当世界遭遇巨大风暴，或者你的生命和境遇发生巨变时，你就能处于最佳位置，安然度过，甚至从中受益。你降低了遭遇变化的风险，甚至降低了遭遇灾难性变化的风险。你摆脱了人们执念的执着自然。</p>
<p>You are not allowing yourself to be consumed by anything, for you must be the captain of your ship. No one else can really run it for you. You must be the captain of your ship. You must be aware of your circumstances. You must know of your provisions. You must know of your strengths and weaknesses and your capabilities to be out in life, particularly in the face of the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>你不允许你自己被任何事物吞噬，因为你必须做你这艘船的船长。没有人能够真正替你驾驶它。你必须做你这艘船的船长。你必须觉知你的境况。你必须知道你的供给。你必须知道你的优势和劣势，以及你在生命中前进的能力，尤其是在面对变革的巨浪时。</p>
<p>People assume their governments will take care of them, their communities will take care of them, social services will be provided. But you cannot assume these things into the future.</p>
<p>人们认为政府会照顾他们，社区会照顾他们，社会服务也会得到提供。但你无法将这些事情假设到未来。</p>
<p>You are going to have to think more courageously and more carefully about how you are going to navigate the difficult times ahead, when social services may not be provided or may not be adequate because there will be so many people depending upon them.</p>
<p>你必须更加勇敢、更加谨慎地思考如何度过未来的困难时期，届时社会服务可能无法提供或不足，因为会有太多人依赖它们。</p>
<p>Here you must rethink your work, where you live, how you travel, what you do, where you invest your time and energy. This is the deep evaluation, you see. It is very thorough. The New Message teaching on the Great Waves provides the guidelines and the instruction for how to carry out this deep evaluation.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须重新思考你的工作，你的居住地，你的出行方式，所做的事情，你的时间和精力投入到哪里。你看，这是一次深度的评估。它非常彻底。新讯息关于变革巨浪的教导提供了如何进行这个深度评估的指导和指示。</p>
<p>This requires strength and courage and objectivity. You have the potential for these three things within yourself, but you must call upon them again and again to build this strength, and to have confidence in this strength, and to experience it serving you and being of service to others.</p>
<p>这需要实力、勇气和客观性。你内在拥有这三者的潜能，但你必须一次又一次地召唤它们，来建立这种实力，对这种力量抱有信心，并体验它为你的服务以及为他人的服务。</p>
<p>Therefore, when We speak of balance, We speak of balance between the Four Pillars of your life. And this balance is more inclusive than you will realize at the outset, for these Pillars overlap, and they provide a greater perspective on every aspect of your life.</p>
<p>因此，当我们谈论平衡时，我们谈论的是你生命四大支柱之间的平衡。这种平衡比你一开始意识到的更具包容性，因为这些支柱相互重叠，它们为你生命的每个面向提供了一种更伟大的视角。</p>
<p>Here, for example, in the Pillar of Work, you realize that work is involved in anything you are trying to change. If you are trying to change your circumstances, that is work. If you are trying to change your attitudes, that is work. If you are trying to minimize your fear and sense of inadequacy, that is work. If you are trying to relocate your home, that is work. If you are looking for a more stable employment, that is work. So here, for example, the Work Pillar becomes relevant to everything that you are trying to do that involves change.</p>
<p>例如，在工作支柱中，你会意识到，任何你试图改变的事情都离不开工作。如果你试图改变你的处境，那就是工作。如果你试图改变你的态度，那就是工作。如果你试图淡化你的恐惧和不足感，那就是工作。如果你试图搬家，那就是工作。如果你正在寻找一份更稳定的工作，那就是工作。因此，例如，工作支柱与你试图做的一切与改变相关的事息息相关。</p>
<p>Another example is that your Pillar of Spiritual Development is involved in everything you do because here you have the opportunity to be guided by Knowledge in everything you do. So your spiritual life is not disassociated from your outer life here. It is not disassociated from your work, or your relationships, your attitudes or your beliefs. Spiritual work is work, and therefore it is relevant to your Pillar of Work.</p>
<p>另一个例子是，你的精神发展支柱与你所做的一切息息相关，因为在此你有机会在你所做的一切中受到内识的指引。因此，你的精神生命与你在此的外在生命并非割裂。它与你的工作，或你的关系，你的态度或你的信仰并非割裂。精神工作本身就是工作，因此它与你的工作支柱息息相关。</p>
<p>So you see here that your Pillars provide a greater perspective on all aspects of your life. Everything that you are involved in or engaged in represents relationship at one level or another. Everything you are trying to affect, to change, to build, or to alter requires work. Your ability to engage yourself with work requires health—mental and physical health. And everything you are involved in opens the door to the power and the presence of Knowledge within you. Therefore, your Pillar of Spiritual Development now becomes relevant to everything.</p>
<p>因此，你在这里看见，你的支柱为你生命的各个面向提供了一种更伟大的视角。你所参与或从事的一切，都代表着某种层面的关系。你试图影响、改变、构建或改变的一切，都需要工作。你投入工作的能力需要健康——心理和生理的健康。你参与的一切，都为你内在内识的力量和存在打开了大门。因此，你的精神发展支柱现在变得与一切息息相关。</p>
<p>This is a complete experience of life, and it will liberate you from so many small things that are drawing way too much energy from you now. You only have so much time. You only have so much energy. You can only consider so many things. You can only do so many things.</p>
<p>这是一种完整的生命体验，它将把你从那些耗费你太多精力的琐事中解放出来。你的时间有限，你的精力有限，你只能考虑那么多事情，你只能做那么多事情。</p>
<p>Part of the deep evaluation is a reconsideration of where all this time and energy is going, and where it must go now. It is a re-evaluation of your involvements with people, your activities, what you give your thoughts and concern to.</p>
<p>深度评估的一部分是重新思考所有这些时间和能量都花在了哪里，以及现在必须花在哪儿。它重新评估你与他人的互动、你的活动，以及你投入思考和关注的事物。</p>
<p>People are losing energy in so many different ways—through idle conversations, through meaningless discussions, through hopeless pursuits. They are reacting strongly to little problems and are not reacting to big problems. Their energy is being lost and wasted, misappropriated, given to things of little or no consequence.</p>
<p>人们以各种各样的方式浪费能量——无聊的谈话、毫无意义的讨论、毫无希望的追求。他们对小问题反应强烈，却对大问题反应迟钝。他们的能量被浪费、被挪用，被投入到无关紧要或毫无意义的事情上。</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are great issues facing them that they must address. Knowledge within them is warning them, encouraging them, restraining them, motivating them, but they may not feel its power and its presence.</p>
<p>与此同时，他们面临着必须解决的伟大问题。他们内在的内识正在警告他们、鼓励他们、约束他们、激励他们，但他们或许感受不到它的力量和它的存在。</p>
<p>You can begin to see here, if you are understanding these words, that your life must be established on a much stronger foundation. It is not enough to merely make minor adjustments in your circumstances or in your thinking. There really has to be a great shift. This is driven not only by a sense of inner need, but now in the face of the Great Waves of change, it is being encouraged by great external needs as well.</p>
<p>如果你理解了这些话语，在这里，你可以开始看见，你的生命必须建立在一个更坚实的基础之上。仅仅在你的境况或思维中做出微小的调整是不够的。真的必须有一种伟大的转变。这不仅受到内在需求感的驱动，而且如今，面对变革的巨浪，它也受到伟大的外在需求的推动。</p>
<p>Most people will not do very well in the face of the Great Waves of change. They are not aware of them. They are not prepared for them. They have not taken the time to build an ark to sustain them through a long period of great uncertainty and upheaval. Their foundation is weak. They do not have much mental strength to tackle so many different problems all at once. They do not have great resources because their Pillars are weak. They may not have the mental or physical health. They may not have the financial stability. They may be very poorly positioned in the face of the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>大多数人在面对变革巨浪时不会表现得非常好。他们没有觉察到它们。他们没有为它们做好准备。他们没有花时间去建造一艘方舟，来支撑他们度过漫长的巨大不确定性和动荡时期。他们的基础薄弱。他们没有足够的心理力量来同时应对如此多的不同问题。他们没有伟大的资源，因为他们的支柱薄弱。他们可能缺乏心理或生理健康。他们可能缺乏财务稳定。在面对变革巨浪时，他们可能处于非常不利的位置。</p>
<p>So never think that you should go along with everyone else or that you should rely upon consensus, for this really is a prescription for failure. And do not think this is about love and fear. It is really about courage and responsibility. Love and fear become a dichotomy that people use to try to avoid or to escape from life. They think it is all about your attitude.</p>
<p>所以，永远不要认为你应该随波逐流，或者应该依赖共识，因为这真的只会招致失败。也不要认为这关乎爱与恐惧。这关乎勇气与责任。爱与恐惧变成了一种二分法，人们用它来试图回避或逃避生命。他们认为这全在于你的态度。</p>
<p>But really life requires much more from you. It requires awareness. It requires skill. It requires responsibility and the ability to function successfully with others.</p>
<p>但实际上，生命需要你具备更多。它需要觉知。它需要技巧。它需要责任感，以及与他人成功合作的能力。</p>
<p>It is not merely a problem of attitude or perception. It is not reliant upon how you look at a problem or the circumstances, for you are still disassociated when you are doing this. You have not come to meet life face to face. You are not opening yourself to see what must be done, regardless of your preferences in the matter.</p>
<p>它不仅仅是态度或感知的问题。它不依赖于你如何看待问题或境况，因为当你这样做的时候，你仍然是游离的。你还没有来​​直面生命。你没有打开你自己去审视必须做什么，无论你对此事的偏好如何。</p>
<p>It is not an intellectual issue. It is facing life squarely. It is looking at the Four Pillars of your life. It is looking at your environment. It is reassessing your position regarding all these things and saying to life: “What must I see? What must I know? And what must I do?”</p>
<p>它不是一个智力问题。它是直接面对生命。它是审视你生命的四大支柱。它是审视你的环境。它是重新评估你对所有这些事情的立场，并对生命说：“我必须看见什么？我必须知道什么？我必须做什么？”</p>
<p>There is no negotiating here. There is no bargaining here. You cannot be timid and evasive or clever or deceptive here if you are to meet the reality of your life face to face. You cannot be in denial and just say: “Well, this can’t happen, and that can’t happen, and I won’t look at this, and I won’t look at that.” You have to face the reality of your life as it is at this moment. And you have to face what is coming over the horizon.</p>
<p>这里没有谈判，没有讨价还价。如果你要直面生命的现实，就不能胆怯、逃避、耍小聪明或欺骗。你不能否认，只是说：“嗯，这不可能发生，那也不可能发生，我不想考虑这个，我不想考虑那个。”你必须面对你生命此刻的现实。你必须面对即将发生的一切。</p>
<p>You either see it or you do not. You can either face it or you cannot. It does not require a great deal of sophistication, or cleverness, or intellectual capacity. It is a matter of simplicity and courage, and a sense of personal responsibility and commitment.</p>
<p>你要么看见它，要么看不到它。你要么能够面对它，要么无法面对它。它不需要太多的世故、聪明或智力。它关乎简单性和勇气，以及个人的责任感和奉献精神。</p>
<p>People have devised many escapes, many defensive mechanisms. People have retreated into many different places. A great deal of excuses have been made for things that simply must be faced. People have established patterns of avoidance, patterns of compromise, patterns of false self-assurance.</p>
<p>人们设计了许多逃避的办法，许多防御机制。人们躲进了许多不同的地方。为那些必须面对的事情找了无数的借口。人们建立了回避的模式、妥协的模式、虚假自信的模式。</p>
<p>If you are not concerned, it means you are not looking. If you do not feel the power of your times, then you are not paying attention. If you do not see the fragility of your circumstances, then you are not being accountable.</p>
<p>如果你不关心，就意味着你没有观察。如果你没有感受到时代的力量，就意味着你没有关注。如果你没有看见你处境的脆弱，就意味着你没有承担起责任。</p>
<p>This is a great confrontation with life, and it is a redeeming one if you can face life; if you can ask life for what you must see, what you must know and what you must do. This is the path of redemption. This is what will enable you to fill in the gaps of your life, to become strong where you are weak and to use your growing capacity and strength to meet every aspect of your life.</p>
<p>这是与生命的一次伟大对抗，如果你能面对生命，如果你能向生命询问你必须看见的、你必须知道的和你必须做的，那么这将是一次救赎。这是救赎之路。这将使你能够填补你生命的空白，在你脆弱的地方变得强大，并运用你不断增长的能力和实力去应对你生命的每个面向。</p>
<p>God has given you a greater power so that you can be the captain of your ship, for you must be the captain of your ship. You cannot just rely on others to tow you along, as if you were dead weight.</p>
<p>上帝已经赋予你一种更伟大的力量，让你能够成为自己这艘船的船长，因为你必须要成为自己这艘船的船长。你不能仅仅依靠别人拖着你前行，就像你是个沉重的负担一样。</p>
<p>The Great Waves of change are the most powerful forces of change the human family has ever faced. And because there are many of these Great Waves, overlapping with one another, it creates a very confusing and perplexing situation. Only Knowledge within you will know how to navigate these waters and the many challenges that they will present.</p>
<p>变革的巨浪是人类大家庭迄今面临的最强大的变革驱动力。由于这些巨浪众多，彼此重叠，这造成了一种非常令人困惑和迷惑的局面。只有你内在的内识才能知道如何驾驭这些浪潮以及它们将带来的诸多挑战。</p>
<p>The New Message from God has been given to alert, to strengthen and to prepare the human family for these great events, and to prepare in such a way that your greater spiritual power and Intelligence come into your awareness and your experience, and that your preparation redeems you and frees you from that which compromises your life and makes you blind.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息被赋予，是为了警示、强化和准备人类大家庭应对这些重大事件，并以这样一种方式进行准备，以便你的更伟大精神力量和智能进入你的觉知和你的体验，以便你的准备救赎你，并让你摆脱那些危害你生命、使你盲目的事物。</p>
<p>The New Message returns your vision, your strength, your capabilities, and the power and the potency of meaningful relationship to your life. It does this not simply to meet a great inner need, but also to enable you to not only survive the Great Waves of change but to be of service to others. For it is within these Great Waves of change that your greater gifts to others will emerge and become known to you.</p>
<p>新讯息将你的视野、你的实力、你的能力以及有意义关系的力量和潜能回归你的生命。它这样做，不仅是为了满足你一种伟大的内在需求，也是为了让你不仅能够在变革巨浪中生存下来，还能服务他人。因为正是在这些变革巨浪中，你给予他人的更伟大礼物将会浮现并被你知道。</p>
<p>Everything here can work to assist you, to strengthen you and to empower you, but you must approach them correctly. You must build the Four Pillars of your life, and you must build them under the guidance of Knowledge within yourself for your actions to be truly effective and to have a permanent benefit.</p>
<p>这里的一切都能够帮助你、强化你、授权你，但你必须正确地对待它们。你必须建立你生命的四大支柱，你必须在你内在内识的指引下构建它们，这样你的行动才能真正有效，并拥有持久的益处。</p>
<p>The New Message from God reveals how this can be done, how to prepare, what you must see, know, and do. It builds a base of wisdom and competence within yourself, wisdom and confidence that you need today and that you will need increasingly in the times to come.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息揭示了如何做到这一点，如何进行准备，以及你必须看见、知道和做的事情。它构建了你自己内在的智慧和能力的基础，这些智慧和信心是你今天需要的，并且你将在未来的时代越来越需要它。</p>
<p>Do not withdraw from the face of life, for you were sent here to serve this world under the very circumstances that are emerging now. Your social mind will want to hide and protect itself, but your deeper Mind is here for a greater purpose. But for this greater purpose to be realized, experienced and fulfilled, you must build a strong foundation within yourself and around yourself.</p>
<p>不要逃避生命，因为你被派遣来此，就是为了在当下正在呈现的境况下服务这个世界。你的社会心灵将想要隐藏和保护它自己，但你更深层次的心灵在此是为了一个更伟大目的。但为了让这个更伟大目的得以实现、体验和成就，你必须在你内在以及在你周围构建一个坚实的基础。</p>
<p>Do not simply trust change because change can destroy you. Do not simply have confidence that whatever happens is appropriate, for circumstances can conspire against you. Do not live on false assumptions. Do not be complacent or falsely self-assured, or you will not be alert and prepared and observant enough to recognize what life is telling you and to prepare accordingly.</p>
<p>不要轻易相信改变，因为改变会摧毁你。不要轻易相信无论发生什么都是适当的，因为情况可能会对你不利。不要生活在错误的假设之中。不要沾沾自喜或虚假地自我肯定，否则你将无法保持足够的警觉、准备和观察力，从而无法识别生命正在告诉你的事情，并做出相应的准备。</p>
<p>This is all a gift of love for you and for all of humanity. People are confused about love and fear. They think love is passivity and acceptance. They do not see the power of love to challenge people, to confront people, to demand things of people, to require courage and integrity from people, to require higher standards from people, to require selfless behavior from people. This is love.</p>
<p>这一切都是爱的礼物，赐予你，也赐予全人类。人们混淆了爱与恐惧。他们认为爱是被动和接受。他们看不到爱的力量：挑战他人，对抗他人，向他人索取，要求他人拥有勇气和完整性，要求他人拥有更高的标准，要求他人无私奉献。这是爱。</p>
<p>So much of what people think is love is really fear—the fear of not having, the fear of being inadequate or insufficient, the fear of being unacceptable, the fear of not surviving. So much behavior is put on top of this fear, and much of this behavior looks loving and caring and beatific. But underneath, what motivates it is fear itself.</p>
<p>人们认为的爱，很多其实是恐惧——害怕一无所有，害怕自己不够好或不足，害怕不被接受，害怕无法生存。很多行为都建立在这种恐惧之上，很多行为看起来充满爱意、关怀备至、充满幸福。但其深层含义，驱动这些行为的，其实是恐惧本身。</p>
<p>That is why, do not think you can use love and fear as the criteria for determining the reality of life around yourself. You do not even know what love and fear is, and their realities have become so intertwined and so twisted that it is very difficult for people to make clear distinctions here.</p>
<p>正因如此，不要认为你可以用爱与恐惧来判断你自己周围生命的现实。你甚至不知道爱与恐惧是什么，它们的现实已经如此交织、如此扭曲，以至于人们很难在这里做出清晰的区分。</p>
<p>That is why you need the power and the presence of Knowledge within yourself, for Knowledge is not confused about these things. God has given you Knowledge to guide you, to prepare you and to redeem you. And this Knowledge is prepared for the Great Waves of change. It is not threatened by them. This represents your greater strength and the great endowment from God.</p>
<p>正因为如此，你需要你内在内识的力量和存在，因为内识对这些事情并不困惑。上帝赋予你内识来指引你、准备你、救赎你。并且这个内识是为变革巨浪而准备的。它不会受到它们的威胁。这代表着你的更伟大实力和来自上帝的伟大恩赐。</p>
<p>That is why you must be a student of Knowledge if you are to fully benefit from the power and the potency of this greater Intelligence within yourself, and to encourage people’s awareness of this power and potency within themselves.</p>
<p>这就是为什么你必须成为一名内识的学生，如果你想充分受益于你自己内在的这种更伟大智能的力量和潜能，并鼓励人们觉知到他们自己内在的这种力量和潜能。</p>
<p>It will require great strength and fortitude, great compassion and great determination for humanity to face and to weather the Great Waves of change. For the demands of life will grow, exceeding what you experience now.</p>
<p>人类需要伟大的实力和毅力、伟大的同情心和伟大的决心来面对和抵御变革的巨浪。因为生命的要求将会增长，超越你们现在所经历的。</p>
<p>You must be prepared for this and to build your foundation in Knowledge while you have time, and to learn The Way of Knowledge so you may bring a greater strength and a greater clarity to your decisions.</p>
<p>你必须为此做好准备，并在有时间的时候在内识中建立你的基础，并学习内识之路，这样你就可以为你的决策带来一种更伟大的力量和一种更清晰的觉知。</p>
<p>You must find the source of your inner strength if you are to have the courage and the determination to overcome the limitations you have placed in your life already. This strength and this power lives within you now, waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>你必须找到内在力量的源泉，才能有勇气和决心克服你已经在生命中设置的限制。这种力量现在就生活在你的内心，正等待着你去发现。</p>
