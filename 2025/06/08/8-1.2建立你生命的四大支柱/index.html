<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on September 15, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 9 月 15 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are Four Pillars to your life. They represent the strength of your life, the stability of your life. They represent your ability to withstand change and to take advantage of opportunity. They represent your ability to face disappointment and uncertainty. Like the four legs of a table, they uphold your life.</p>
<p>你的生命有四大支柱。它们代表着你生命的实力，你生命的稳定性。它们代表着你承受变化和抓住机遇的能力。它们代表着你面对失望和不确定性的能力。就像桌子的四条腿一样，它们支撑着你的生命。</p>
<p>There is the Pillar of Relationships; there is the Pillar of Work and Providership; there is the Pillar of Health and there is the Pillar of your Spiritual Development. Each of these Pillars is of equal value. And even though at any particular moment you may be focused on one of these Pillars, the truth is they all must be built.</p>
<p>有关系支柱；有工作和供养支柱；有健康支柱；还有精神发展支柱。每个支柱都具有同等的价值。即使在任何特定时刻你可能专注于其中一个支柱，但事实上，所有支柱都必须被构建。</p>
<p>Like the four legs of a table, they uphold that table, and they uphold whatever is put upon that table. Whatever responsibilities or goals that you establish in your life require that each of these Pillars be strong and that you are attentive to each one of them.</p>
<p>如同桌子的四条腿，它们支撑着桌子，也支撑着桌子上的一切。无论你在生命中确立了什么责任或目标，都需要这些支柱中的每一个都坚固，并且你对它们中的每一个都保持关注。</p>
<p>Neglect even one of these Pillars, and you will be greatly weakened and prone to failure and defeat. That is why they represent a core part of your personal development. They represent a core part of your spiritual practice and your focus in life.</p>
<p>哪怕忽视其中任何一个支柱，你都会被极大地削弱，并容易遭受失败和挫败。正因如此，它们代表着你个人发展的核心部分。它们代表着你的精神练习和生命焦点的核心部分。</p>
<p>Many people give themselves to one Pillar only. They perhaps involve themselves in their work—trying to accumulate wealth, trying to gain a greater and greater position in the social structure of their culture. And so their work becomes the dominating and overarching focus of their life—work and the accumulation of money, the accumulation of power and social power. Yet their health is neglected. Their relationships become simply tools that they use to build their personal wealth or their vocation. And there is often little or no emphasis upon their spiritual development. While they may achieve some substantial results in their pursuit, their life is weak and unbalanced and prone to immense personal failure.</p>
<p>很多人只把他们自己交给一个支柱。他们或许全身心投入工作——试图积累财富，试图在他们文化的社会结构中获得越来越高的地位。因此，他们的工作成为他们生命中主导和最重要的焦点——工作和金钱的积累，权力和社会权力的积累。然而他们的健康却被忽视。他们的人际关系仅仅成为他们用来构建个人财富或职业的工具。而且，他们的精神发展往往很少或根本没有得到重视。尽管他们可能在他们的追求中取得一些实质性成果，但他们的生命是脆弱和不平衡的，并且容易遭受巨大的个人失败。</p>
<p>Other people give their whole focus to their relationships, pursuing romance or becoming obsessed with their friends or their extended family. Emotionally drawn in, captivated, they give little attention to the other Pillars of their life, and as a result they do not have discernment in relationships. They cannot provide financial stability or security in relationships. And their personal health, which they take for granted, can fail them and undermine anything that they establish with other people.</p>
<p>其他人把全部注意力放在他们的关系上，追求浪漫，或沉迷于他们的朋友或他们的大家庭。他们被情感所吸引，被迷惑，很少关注他们生命中的其他支柱，结果他们在关系中缺乏辨识力。他们无法在关系中提供经济稳定或安全感。他们视之为理所当然的个人健康，可能会让他们失望，并破坏他们与他人建立的任何关系。</p>
<p>There are some people who give themselves entirely to their spiritual study and practice. And unless they are a true monastic, they will forfeit their work, their providership, their personal health and valuable relationships for their spiritual pursuit, thinking that the goal of enlightenment, or perhaps becoming religious to a very great degree, will solve all of their needs and requirements. If they are a true monastic, that is different. But monasticism is reserved for very unique individuals and is not a pathway for people in general.</p>
<p>有些人全身心投入到精神研究和修行。除非他们是真正的僧侣，否则他们会为了精神追求而放弃工作、生活、个人健康和宝贵的人际关系，认为开悟的目标，或者或许是成为虔诚的信徒，就能解决他们所有的需要和需求。如果他们是真正的僧侣，情况就不同了。但修道生活只为非常独特的个体保留，并非普世之道。</p>
<p>So the people who give themselves to their Spiritual Pillar, the Pillar of Spiritual Development, have very weak relationships, no financial foundation, very little skills in functioning in the world and often poor mental and physical health. Yet they feel that their pursuit of spiritual powers or spiritual recognition will compensate for all these other things.</p>
<p>因此，那些把他们自己交给精神支柱——精神发展支柱——的人，人际关系非常薄弱，没有经济基础，在世间运作的技能非常有限，而且通常身心健康状况不佳。然而，他们却觉得对精神力量或精神认知的追求能够弥补所有这些其他方面的问题。</p>
<p>Then there are people who give themselves to their health. They are extreme in their focus upon health. Perhaps their health is weak, and this is taking all of their attention. Or perhaps they want to be athletic and beautiful, and so they devote a major part of their lives to their appearance and their athletic abilities, but this is often at the cost of the other Pillars in their life. So while they may be impressive in appearance, their mental health can be poor, their relationships can be weak and failing, they may have very little financial foundation in the world and very few skills because they have given themselves over to one Pillar primarily.</p>
<p>然后，有些人把他们自己交给了健康。他们极端地关注健康。或许他们的健康很虚弱，这占据了他们所有的注意力。又或许他们想要运动和美丽，因此他们把生命的大部分时间交给了他们的外表和运动能力，但这往往是以牺牲他们生命中的其他支柱为代价的。所以，尽管他们的外表可能令人印象深刻，但他们的心理健康可能很差，他们的人际关系可能脆弱且失败，他们可能在这个世界上几乎没有经济基础，也几乎没有技能，因为他们主要把他们自己交给了一个支柱。</p>
<p>Occasionally, you will find the person who has built perhaps two Pillars of their life. But it is rare that you will find someone who has built all the Pillars of their life. When you approach building all the Pillars of your life, you realize that you cannot be extreme in any one of them, that they require a balance and that rather than magnificence, you are seeking for stability and strength.</p>
<p>偶尔，你会发现有人可能只建立了两个生命支柱。但你很少能找到一个建立了所有生命支柱的人。当你着手构建你生命的所有支柱时，你会意识到你无法在任何一个支柱上走极端，它们需要一种平衡，你追求的不是辉煌，而是稳定和力量。</p>
<p>Like the legs of a table, if one is six feet tall and the others are two feet tall, you have a table that cannot hold anything. Place any greater responsibility or requirement on that person, and they cannot shoulder it. They cannot meet that need or that requirement.</p>
<p>就像一张桌子的腿，如果一条腿高六英尺，另一条腿高两英尺，那么这张桌子就什么也放不下。把任何更大的责任或要求放在这个人身上，他们就无法承担。他们无法满足那种需要或要求。</p>
<p>Because life is a process of taking on greater responsibilities, the person whose Pillars are weak or out of balance is extremely prone to failure. The failure that they will face will have to do with the weakness of their Pillars. The unanticipated change that they will face in life can overtake them because they do not have the resident strength and stability that they will need. In truth, your life is only as strong as the weakest of your Pillars.</p>
<p>因为生命是一个承担更伟大责任的过程，支柱薄弱或失衡的人极易失败。他们所面临的失败，往往与支柱的薄弱有关。他们生命中意想不到的变化，可能会因为他们缺乏所需的内在力量和稳定性而落空。事实上，你的生命强度，取决于你最薄弱的支柱。</p>
<p>The development of your Pillars is relevant to your greater purpose for coming into the world, and in that everyone has unique requirements. But in all cases your Pillars must be strong enough and built appropriately to enable you to participate in experiencing and expressing a greater purpose in life. This means that you are taking on greater responsibilities. Even beyond the normal parameters of life, living a life of greater purpose means that you are taking on a greater set of tasks, facing a greater set of challenges. It is not for the weak or the faint of heart.</p>
<p>你支柱的发展与你来到这个世界的更伟大目的息息相关，因为每个人都有独特的需求。但无论如何，你的支柱必须足够强大，并且得到恰当的构建，才能让你能够参与体验和表达一个更伟大的生命目的。这意味着你正在承担更伟大的责任。即使超越了生命的正常范畴，过着一种更伟大目的的生命，也意味着你正在承担一系列更伟大的任务，面对一系列更伟大的挑战。它不适合软弱者或胆怯者。</p>
<p>Many people think that they are ready to take on such greater responsibilities and challenges, but they really do not have the foundation that can sustain them through the long period of preparation and through the many challenges that they will face along the way. They love the idea of living a life of greater purpose and meaning, but they really do not have the foundation to sustain themselves in assuming and maintaining such a life.</p>
<p>很多人认为他们已经准备好承担如此更伟大的责任和挑战，但他们实际上缺乏能够支撑他们度过漫长准备期以及一路上将要面对的诸多挑战的基础。他们热爱过一种更伟大目的和意义的生命的想法，但他们实际上缺乏支撑他们自己承担和维持这样一种生命的基础。</p>
<p>The tragedy of this is evident everywhere. People set great goals for themselves perhaps, only to find that their life is failing them in some arena of their life, around one or more Pillars of their life. Their relationships are failing them, for they have given themselves to other things inordinately, and now their marriages are failing, and they have no real relationship with their children, and they find that there is no one in their life who really knows them and who is really there for them. They have acquaintances. They have friends. But their Pillar of Relationships is not strong enough to really sustain them in any way that is beneficial.</p>
<p>这种悲剧随处可见。人们或许为他们自己设定了伟大的目标，却发现他们的生命只在他们生命的某个领域，围绕着他们生命的一个或多个支柱，正在辜负他们。他们的关系正在辜负他们，因为他们过度地把他们自己交给了其他事物，现在他们的婚姻正在失败，他们和他们的孩子们没有真正的关系，他们发现在他们的生命中，没有人真正知道他们，没有人真正在他们身边。他们有熟人。他们有朋友。但是他们的关系支柱不够强大，无法以任何有益的方式真正支撑他们。</p>
<p>Other people have no real work life. Somehow they have just gotten by because all of their focus is upon other things. So they are financially unstable, [which is] constantly eroding away their life and undermining their relationships. They do not have the strength and the stability to carry on greater activities because they do not have the foundation for this. They are not willing to make the sacrifices that are necessary.</p>
<p>其他人没有实际的工作生活。他们只是勉强糊口，因为他们所有的注意力都集中在其他事情上。所以他们的经济状况不稳定，这不断侵蚀着他们的生命，破坏着他们的人际关系。他们缺乏力量和稳定性来开展更伟大的活动，因为他们缺乏开展这些活动的基础。他们不愿做出必要的牺牲。</p>
<p>People who are entertaining the reality and the possibility of living a greater purpose in their life want it now. They are not willing to work for twenty years to build a foundation for it. They want it now. They want to leap into it now, but they do not have the foundation for it, and they will not be able to go very far.</p>
<p>那些对现实以及实现更伟大生命目的可能性充满期待的人，现在就想要它。他们不愿意花二十年的时间来为实现目的打下基础。他们现在就想要它。他们现在就想一跃而上，但他们缺乏基础，他们也无法走得太远。</p>
<p>It is like climbing a great mountain. You start off and you realize it is really steep, and you do not have the right kind of shoes for it, and the things that you are bringing along are not really the things you really need, and you find you do not have the strength to get very far. You do not have the provisions. Your expectations were perhaps too romantic. You thought this was going to be easy.</p>
<p>它就像攀登一座大山。你出发了，却发现它非常陡峭，你没有合适的鞋子，你携带的东西也并非你真正需要的，你发现自己没有足够的力气走很远。你没有足够的补给。你的期望或许过于浪漫了。你认为这会很容易。</p>
<p>Or it proves to be hard, and you really do not have the strength to undertake it. So you settle for something much less in life. You tell yourself, “Oh, well. This relationship will be good enough for me,” or “This job will be good enough for me.” And you compromise yourself, and you give your life to things that really have no promise. You give your life to people who are really not going anywhere. And though you might feel more secure or relieved of the challenge, in your heart there is a great depression, a great misgiving.</p>
<p>或者事实证明这很艰难，你真的没有实力去承担。于是，你甘愿接受生命中一些不那么重要的事。你告诉你自己：“好吧，这段感情对我来说足够好了”，或者“这份工作对我来说足够好了”。你妥协了你自己，把生命托付给了那些毫无希望的事情。你把生命托付给了那些实际上不会有任何进展的人。尽管你可能会觉得挑战更有安全感，或者松了一口气，但你的内心却充满了巨大的沮丧和疑虑。</p>
<p>It is for this reason that your spiritual practice must focus on building and maintaining the Four Pillars of your life. This requires a lot of time and energy and does not look very spiritual at all. Most of these activities are quite mundane and perhaps do not fit in with your ideals or your ambitions.</p>
<p>正因如此，你的精神练习必须专注于建立和维护你生命的四大支柱。这需要大量的时间和能量，而且看起来一点也不精神。这些活动大多相当平凡，或许与你的理想或抱负不符。</p>
<p>But if you are to have a real foundation to weather the difficulties of life, to navigate the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world, to be prepared for the requirements and the opportunities that living a greater life will reveal, you must have this foundation. Otherwise, you are really fooling yourself. Your will and ambition alone will not be enough. Obsession will not be enough. Eccentricity will only weaken you and lead you to failure.</p>
<p>但如果你想拥有一个真正的基础来应对生命的艰难，来驾驭即将降临世界的巨浪，来为过上更伟大生命所揭示的要求和机遇做好准备，你就必须拥有这个基础。否则，你实际上是在自欺欺人。单靠你的意志和野心是不够的。执着是不够的。偏执只会削弱你，并导致你失败​​。</p>
<p>There are many spiritual teachers in the world who will promise you abundance and enlightenment, fulfillment or spiritual powers, but there are very few of them that will teach you to build the foundation for living a greater life engaged in a greater set of activities and responsibilities. They are selling you on an idea, on a dream, on a hope and a wish. But in the real preparation, people have to work hard and build a foundation.</p>
<p>世界上有许多精神导师，他们会承诺你丰盛、启迪、成就或精神力量，但很少有人会教你如何为更伟大的生命打下基础，去承担更伟大的活动和责任。他们向你兜售一个想法、一个梦想、一个希望和一个愿望。但在真正的准备中，人们必须努力工作，打下基础。</p>
<p>For God will not give you anything greater to do until you have this foundation, until you are ready, until you have the strength and the maturity necessary to assume a greater responsibility.</p>
<p>因为上帝不会给你任何更伟大的事情去做，直到你拥有这个基础，直到你准备好，直到你拥有承担更伟大责任所必需的实力和成熟度。</p>
<p>People think that they are ready, but they are not ready. They expect that God will reveal to them what they are to do, or they will invent great purposes for themselves, but they are not ready. They are driven by their ambition, their personal need or the desire for recognition from others. Perhaps their motivations are more genuine and represent a deep spiritual need, but until they have the foundation, they cannot go very far. And if they think they are really advancing, then it is all the product of their imagination.</p>
<p>人们认为他们已经准备好了，但他们并没有准备好。他们期待上帝会启示他们该做什么，或者他们会为他们自己编造伟大的目的，但他们并没有准备好。他们被他们的野心、他们的个人需求或对他人认可的渴望所驱使。或许他们的动机更加真实，代表着一种深度的精神需求，但直到他们拥有了基础，他们才能走得很远。如果他们认为他们真的在进步，那么这一切都只是他们想象的产物。</p>
<p>Here the demands of a real life exceed what people expect. These demands exceed what many people are willing to give, what they are willing to do. They want to be at the top of the mountain right away. So they think that there is some kind of elevator that will take them there or secret passage that will shoot them to the top, for they are unwilling or unable to make the real journey.</p>
<p>在这里，实际生命的要求超出了人们的预期。这些要求超出了许多人愿意付出、愿意做的事情。他们想要立刻到达山顶。所以他们认为有某种电梯可以带他们到达那里，或者有某种秘密通道可以把他们送上山顶，因为他们不愿意或无法踏上真正的旅程。</p>
<p>So today you have many spiritual teachers and advocates who claim to have great powers and great connections and to offer expedient means to achieve spiritual power and enlightenment. But, really, it is all a mirage. It is based upon hope and expectation and not upon true ability. For they themselves have not built the Four Pillars of their lives, thinking that to do so is beneath them, is unworthy of their attention and does not represent the exaltation of their goals and expectations.</p>
<p>所以今天你们有许多精神导师和倡导者，他们声称拥有强大的力量和强大的人脉，并提供获得精神力量和开悟的便捷方法。但实际上，这一切都是海市蜃楼。它基于希望和期待，而非真正的能力。因为他们自己并没有构建他们生命的四大支柱，认为这样做有失身份，不值得他们关注，也不代表他们目标和期待的提升。</p>
<p>You must build the foundation if you are to live a greater life. You must have the strength. You must have the humility to do this work. You must break free of other relationships and influences that keep you from attending to these greater matters. While other people are idly talking about the accumulation of wealth or power or spiritual fulfillment, you must attend to really building the foundation.</p>
<p>如果你想要活出更伟大的生命，你必须构建基础。你必须拥有实力。你必须拥有谦逊才能完成这项工作。你必须摆脱那些阻碍你关注这些更伟大事情的其他关系和影响。当其他人还在漫不经心地谈论财富、权力或精神满足的积累时，你必须专注于真正地构建基础。</p>
<p>What does this mean? This means that you must take the Steps to Knowledge within yourself, to find the source of your strength and the deeper intelligence that God has placed within you, which alone knows who you are, why you are here and what you are here to accomplish.</p>
<p>这意味着什么？这意味着你必须在你内在开展内识进阶，去发现你的力量源泉以及上帝置于你内在的更深层次智能，唯有它知道你是谁，你为何在此，以及你在此要完成什么。</p>
<p>While you are building this connection to the great endowment of Knowledge within yourself, you are building your Work Pillar so that you have a viable means of sustaining yourself. Perhaps it is very mundane and not exalted, but it must be a focus that can provide for you and for other people. Instead of living hand to mouth, here you must have a great enough Work Pillar to provide for others, to provide for children, to provide for people in need and to secure yourself so that you will not be overwhelmed in the face of the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world.</p>
<p>当你构建与你内在伟大内识禀赋的联接时，你也在构建你的工作支柱，这样你就拥有了一种可行的维持自身生存的方式。或许它非常平凡，并不崇高，但它必须是一个能够供养你和他人的焦点。在这里，你必须拥有一个足够强大的工作支柱，来供养他人，供养孩子，供养需要帮助的人，并保障你自己，这样你就不会在即将降临世界的变革巨浪面前被淹没。</p>
<p>While you are doing this, you must focus on healing your past relationships and building true alliances with other people. Because relationships require a considerable amount of time and focus, this is no small matter. These relationships are not merely to help you fulfill your ambitions but represent a deeper connection with others, relationships that have a spiritual dimension and a practical expression. They are not merely for fun or escape. They represent true alliances, and you must invest yourself in them to build this kind of deeper trust and connection.</p>
<p>当你这样做的时候，你必须专注于疗愈你过去的关系，并与他人建立真正的联盟。因为关系需要大量的时间和专注，所以这绝非易事。这些关系不仅仅是为了帮助你实现你的野心，也代表着与他人更深层次的联结，这些关系拥有精神维度和实际的表达。它们不仅仅是为了娱乐或逃避。它们代表着真正的联盟，你必须投入其中，才能构建这种更深层次的信任和联结。</p>
<p>Then you have your personal health, which involves your mental health and your physical health. You must recognize your psychological weaknesses, your unforgiveness of others and your unresolved conflicts from the past. You must explore how these things can be resolved.</p>
<p>然后，你还有个人健康，这涉及到你的心理健康和生理健康。你必须认识到你的心理弱点、你对他人的不宽恕以及你过去未解决的冲突。你必须探索如何解决这些问题。</p>
<p>Then there is your physical health. If your body is weak, if your body is out of shape, then it may not be able to sustain you as a vehicle in this world. Many promising people have fallen because their physical health was inadequate to sustain the life that they had assumed. Here again you must assess your strengths and your weaknesses. Everyone physically has weak links in their health. What are those weak links? Where is your body strong and where is it fragile? What must you eat that is proper for maintaining a strong constitution? You must exercise every day and find the time to do this.</p>
<p>然后是你的生理健康。如果你的身体虚弱，如果你的身体状况不佳，那么它可能无法支撑你在这个世界上的生存。许多前途无量的人，因为他们的身体健康不足以维持他们所期望的生命，所以最终落败。在这里，你必须再次评估你的优势和劣势。每个人的身体健康都有薄弱环节。这些薄弱环节是什么？你的身体在哪里强壮，又在哪里脆弱？为了保持强健的体格，你必须吃什么才算合适？你必须每天锻炼，并抽出时间去做。</p>
<p>So when you add all of this up, it looks like a tremendous amount of work. And the truth is, it is a tremendous amount of work. Here you do not have time for self-destructive behaviors. You do not have time to languish or be depressed. You do not have time to fall into the pit of your own despair or irresolution. You do not have the time to become eccentric or obsessed with anyone or anything. You do not have time to become obsessed with yourself.</p>
<p>所以，当你把所有这些加起来，这看起来是一项巨大的工作量。而事实是，这确实是一项巨大的工作量。在这里，你没有时间去做自我毁灭的行为。你没有时间憔悴或沮丧。你没有时间陷入你自身的绝望或优柔寡断的深渊。你没有时间变得古怪或沉迷于任何人或任何事。你没有时间沉迷于你自己。</p>
<p>Here building the Four Pillars of your life is the perfect antidote to eccentricity and self-obsession, which are really the source of so much mental illness and personal failure. Here you are working on all fronts, and you are focusing on gaining strength in each of your Pillars and on maintaining a balance between them.</p>
<p>在这里，构建你生命的四大支柱，是治疗怪癖和自我痴迷的完美良药，而怪癖和自我痴迷正是诸多心理疾病和个人失败的根源。在这里，你正在全方位努力，专注于在每个支柱中积累力量，并保持它们之间的平衡。</p>
<p>Then when life’s difficulties emerge, you are strong enough to face them and to adapt to them or to offset them, whatever the case requires, whereas before, these things would have defeated you or set you back.</p>
<p>这样，当生命中的困难出现时，你就足够坚强去面对它们，适应它们或抵消它们，无论情况需要什么，而以前，这些事情可能会打败你或阻碍你。</p>
<p>Without this Four Pillars approach to your life, you will become very prone to eccentricity. You will become very prone to overemphasizing certain aspects of your life to the neglect of others. You will become overly focused on certain things and you will miss other key aspects of your life, and they will be weak and faltering as a result.</p>
<p>如果你的生命中没有这四大支柱，你将很容易变得孤僻。你将很容易过分强调生命的某些方面而忽视其他方面。你将过度关注某些事物，而忽略生命中其他关键的方面，最终导致它们变得脆弱不堪、步履蹒跚。</p>
<p>It is like laying a foundation for a building. You cannot just build the building. You have to build the foundation. You have to lay the plumbing and the wiring. You have to have a foundation that is strong enough to support the structure you are intending to build upon it. All of the necessary infrastructure must be there. Otherwise, the building, no matter how beautiful or impressive, has nothing really to stand upon and cannot function.</p>
<p>它就像为建筑物打地基。你不能只是盖房子。你必须打地基。你必须铺设管道和电线。你必须有一个足够坚固的地基来支撑你打算在其上建造的结构。所有必要的基础设施都必须到位。否则，无论建筑物多么美丽或令人印象深刻，都无法真正立足，也无法正常运转。</p>
<p>This serves then as an example of your own life. People want to build a handsome and impressive life—a life that makes them feel proud, a life that impresses them to others and gives them social power, a life that fulfills ambitions. But without a real foundation, this building will never really be built. Even if it is partially constructed, it will tend to fail because it does not have a sufficient foundation underneath it.</p>
<p>这可以作为你自身生命的一个例子。人们渴望打造一种美好而令人印象深刻的人生——一种让他们感到自豪的人生，一种让他们在别人眼中留下深刻印象并赋予他们社会权力的人生，一种能够实现抱负的人生。但如果没有真正的地基，这座大厦就永远无法真正建成。即使它部分建成，也往往会倒塌，因为它下面没有足够的地基。</p>
<p>There are many people who have made notable achievements in life, but they are mentally ill, or their relationships are a disaster, or they have no inner life—no sense of who they are or where they are going, no connection to Knowledge. And while they might achieve a footnote in history, they themselves are a personal failure. Their gifts could only partially be given. They really did not meet the requirements of their life.</p>
<p>很多人在生命中取得了显著的成就，但他们患有心理疾病，或者他们的人际关系是一场灾难，或者他们没有内在生命——不知道他们是谁，不知道他们要去哪里，没有与内识的联接。尽管他们或许在历史上留下了一个脚印，但他们自身却是一个个人失败者。他们的礼物只能被部分地给予。他们确实没有满足他们生​​命的要求。</p>
<p>Should you build this foundation, the Four Pillars of your life, then your greater purpose will give you a more unique focus that may emphasize one of the Pillars over the others. But you will still have to maintain all the Pillars to have the strength and the stability to meet the challenges of this greater life.</p>
<p>如果你构建了这个基础，即你生命的四大支柱，那么你更伟大的目的将赋予你更独特的焦点，或许会更强调其中某个支柱而非其他支柱。但你仍然需要维护所有支柱，才能拥有实力和稳定性，去应对这更伟大生命的挑战。</p>
<p>If you do not have good mental health and strong relationships, you can fall into despair. If you do not have the resident wisdom that is necessary about living in the world, then you can be influenced by other powers in the mental environment, seduced into thinking things that are not true, or following things that have nowhere to go. Here your promise will be wasted because you did not have the clarity of mind and the sobriety about your life to see the deception.</p>
<p>如果你缺乏良好的心理健康和稳固的人际关系，你就会陷入绝望。如果你缺乏在世间生存所必需的内在智慧，你就会被心理环境中的其他力量所影响，被引诱去思考不真实的事情，或追随那些无处可去的事情。你的承诺将会付诸东流，因为你缺乏清晰的心灵以及对生命的清醒，无法看清其中的欺骗。</p>
<p>People can start off really focused on something important and then simply be carried away by something else. Or they take themselves too seriously, and they think they are a superman or a superwoman, and they lose the focus of their initial intent. When you trace this back to a person’s Pillars, you can see where the difficulty began.</p>
<p>人们一开始可能非常专注于某件重要的事情，但之后却被其他事情带偏。或者他们过于自视甚高，认为他们是超人或女超人，最终失去了最初的目标。如果你追溯到一个人的支柱，就可以看见困难的根源。</p>
<p>Building the Pillar of Relationships, for example, means that you have people in your life who can point out to you your weaknesses and who are free to correct your misperceptions. This will moderate your behavior and make you more self-aware and more circumspect about your ideas and your goals. Here your life is not full of critics, but it has people in it who are committed to the truth and can point out to you, while you are making a mistake, where your life is going off course, or who can warn you about the influences of other people or even hidden powers that can dissuade you from your greater purpose.</p>
<p>例如，构建关系支柱意味着你生命中有人能够指出你的弱点，并能够自由地纠正你的错误感知。这将缓和你的行为，让你更加自我觉知，对你的想法和目标更加审慎。在这里，你的生命中并不充满批评者，但却有坚持真理的人，他们可以在你犯错时指出你的生命偏离了方向，或者警告你不要受到其他人甚至是隐藏力量的影响，以免你偏离更伟大的目的。</p>
<p>Without relationships of this quality, anyone is prone to failure. Anyone can make critical mistakes in their estimation and in their decisions. You really cannot do anything significant in life unless you have relationships that can function at the level of a higher purpose. Discovering these relationships and discerning them from all the other attractions of wealth, beauty and charm that may stimulate you, takes real concentration and real self-honesty.</p>
<p>如果没有这种高质量的人际关系，任何人都容易失败。任何人都可能在评估和决策中犯下重大错误。除非你拥有能够达成更高宗旨的人际关系，否则你真的无法在生命中成就任何伟大的事情。发现这些人际关系，并将它们从财富、美貌和魅力等所有可能刺激你的诱惑中辨别出来，需要真正的专注和真正的自我诚实。</p>
<p>People try to achieve success, and they just use other people as tools to fulfill their ambitions. But their life is a tragedy as a result. They leave behind them a string of disappointments and of people who resent them and do not respect them. What is the value of this? What kind of wealth is worth this kind of hostility and failure? Certainly, happiness would be beyond the reach of such a person, and whatever they were able to achieve in their obsession over their careers would be offset by their personal losses. This is very common.</p>
<p>人们渴望成功，却把他人当作实现他们野心的工具。结果，他们的生命却成了一场悲剧。他们身后留下的是一连串的失望，以及那些怨恨和不尊重他们的人。这一切究竟有什么价值？什么样的财富值得他们承受如此的敌意和失败？毫无疑问，这种人无法获得幸福，他们对事业的痴迷所带来的一切成就，最终都会被个人的损失所抵消。这种情况很常见。</p>
<p>And of course there are many people who do not have a Pillar of Spiritual Development. Even if they believe in a religion and have adopted a set of beliefs and go through the rituals and motions of being religious, if they have no connection to Knowledge, then they have no inner life. They have no deeper recognition. Without this, they are guessing in life, and they are following the prescriptions of their culture and the influence of other people.</p>
<p>当然，很多人没有精神发展支柱。即使他们信仰某种宗教，采纳了一套信仰，并履行宗教仪式和活动，如果他们没有与内识的联接，那么他们就没有内在生命。他们没有更深层次的认知。没有内识，他们在生命中只是猜测，他们只是遵循他们文化的规定和他人的影响。</p>
<p>Being unable to follow the great inner direction that God has given them through Knowledge, they now become a slave to other forces—a slave to their ambitions, a slave to meeting the expectations of their family or their friends, a slave to whatever their culture tells them that they should value and adopt.</p>
<p>由于无法遵循上帝通过内识赋予他们的伟大内在指引，他们现在成为了其他驱动力的奴隶——他们野心的奴隶，满足他们家人或朋友期望的奴隶，他们的文化告诉他们应该珍视和采纳的一切的奴隶。</p>
<p>This is going through life blind, and it leads to tremendous disappointment and calamities. People do not see when great tragedies occur and befall them, even though the signs were there. People do not see their changing environment and the impact it could have upon their lives because they did not see the signs, because they were not strong with Knowledge.</p>
<p>这是盲目地度过生命，它会导致巨大的失望和灾难。当巨大的悲剧发生并降临到他们身上时，人们看不见，即使迹象已经存在。人们看不到他们不断变化的环境及其可能对他们生命造成的影响，因为他们没有看到迹象，因为他们的内识不够强大。</p>
<p>However you may conceive of your life and whatever your values may be, if you consider your life within the context of having four fundamental Pillars, you can begin to recognize that should you neglect any one of them or approach any one of them with unreal expectations or self-deception, it will create a tremendous difficulty for you.</p>
<p>不管你如何设想你的生命，不管你的价值观是什么，如果你在四大基本支柱的背景下思考你的生命，你就会开始认识到，如果你忽视其中任何一个，或者带着不切实际的期望或自欺欺人的态度对待其中任何一个，它都会给你带来极大的困难。</p>
<p>You have the entire world around you to demonstrate the results. Here instead of judging and condemning people, look at their lives in terms of their Pillars. If you have the opportunity to know the circumstances of a person’s life, instead of just judging them for the way they appear or behave, really look at the Pillars of their life. Where did they invest themselves? What was really overlooked or neglected? Where did their personal development cease, or where was it never given in the first place?</p>
<p>你周围的整个世界都在展现这些结果。与其评判和谴责他人，不如从他们的支柱角度审视他们的生命。如果你有机会知道一个人的人生境遇，与其仅仅根据他们的外表或行为来评判他们，不如真正审视他们生命的支柱。他们把他们自己投入到了哪里？哪些方面真正被忽视或忽略了？他们的个人发展在哪里停止了，或者在哪里从一开始就没有得到发展？</p>
<p>[Here] you can begin to see the results, which are manifest all around you. In your own deep evaluation of your life, see where you have invested yourself within the context of the Four Pillars of your life. Which of these Pillars have you built and which have you neglected? Where have you overemphasized your life, or where have you become obsessive? What have you missed?</p>
<p>在这里，你可以开始看到结果，它们在你周围显化。在你对你自身生命的深度评估中，看看你在你生命四大支柱的框架内把你投入到了哪里。你建立了哪些支柱，又忽略了哪些？你在哪些方面过分强调了你的生命，或者你在哪些方面变得执着？你错过了什么？</p>
<p>This teaching on the Four Pillars of your life is part of God’s New Message and Revelation for the world. It is being given to prepare you to become strong and stable, wise and compassionate, and capable of facing a world of ever-increasing instability and turmoil in the face of the Great Waves of change—environmental degradation, violent weather, resource depletion, increasing political and economic instability and the growing threat of war. When you begin to think of the Great Waves of change that God’s New Message is revealing, you will see how weak you really are and where you lack preparation and strength and stability.</p>
<p>关于你生命四大支柱的这个教导，是上帝赐予世界的新讯息和启示的一部分。它被赋予，是为了帮助你进行准备，使你变得强大而稳定，明智而富有同情心，并有能力面对一个在变革巨浪面前日益加剧的不稳定和动荡的世界——环境恶化、恶劣天气、资源枯竭、日益加剧的政治和经济不稳定以及日益增长的战争威胁。当你开始思考上帝新讯息正在揭示的变革巨浪时，你将看到你们实际上是多么软弱，以及你在哪些方面缺乏准备、实力和稳定。</p>
<p>You will need a stable foundation, a strong ark to ride these waves of change without sinking, without breaking apart, without collapsing. This is why the teaching in the Four Pillars of your life is part of the study and preparation that God’s New Message is providing. For without it, the powerful impacts of the Great Waves of change, and even the normal requirements of life, could undermine you and could overtake you, and your chance of success would be very small.</p>
<p>你需要一个稳固的基石，一艘坚固的方舟，来驾驭这些变革的浪潮，不沉没，不瓦解，不坍塌。正因如此，你生命四大支柱中的教导，是上帝新讯息所提供的学习和准备的一部分。因为没有它，变革巨浪的强大冲击，甚至生命的正常需求，都可能摧毁你，吞噬你，你成功的机会将非常渺茫。</p>
<p>What is success? Success is the ability to experience and express the greater purpose that has brought you into the world—a greater purpose that will require strong relationships, a greater purpose that will require that you are stable and that you can adapt to changing circumstances in the world, a greater purpose that will require that you have a deep connection to the greater Knowledge that God has placed within you, to guide you and to protect you and to lead you to your greater life.</p>
<p>成功是什么？成功是体验和表达将你带到世界的更伟大目的的能力——一个更伟大目的将要求强大的关系，一个更伟大目的将要求你保持稳定并能够适应世界不断变化的境遇，一个更伟大目的将要求你与上帝置于你内在的更伟大内识拥有一种深度的联接，以指引你、保护你并引领你走向你的更伟大生命。</p>
<p>This greater purpose will require that your health be stable, that you be mentally sound and physically able to undertake the great requirements and responsibilities of this higher purpose in life.</p>
<p>这个更伟大目的将要求你的健康状况稳定，要求你的身心健全，能够承担起生命中的更高宗旨的伟大要求和责任。</p>
<p>That really is success, in a greater sense, in a greater way. It is not just success in terms of what your culture values or what your family thinks is significant. It is success in terms of your real nature and the Creator of all life, who has sent you into the world to give special gifts to a world in need.</p>
<p>这才是真正的成功，一种更伟大意义上的成功。这不仅仅是你的文化所珍视的，或你的家庭认为重要的事物所赋予的成功。这是你真实自然以及所有生命的造物主所赋予的成功，是造物主派遣你来到这个世界，为这个需要帮助的世界给予特定的礼物。</p>
<p>As We have said, building the Four Pillars of your life is the perfect antidote to eccentricity and self-obsession. It is the perfect foundation for building a life of real meaning and purpose. It is an antidote to depression and low self-esteem. It is an antidote to the inability to accept oneself or to value one’s characteristics. It is a perfect antidote to failing to discern real relationships from all the other attractions to which people fall prey. It is the perfect antidote to having your life collapse around you because it does not have the strength to withstand the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>正如我们所说，构建你生命的四大支柱是对抗怪癖和自我痴迷的完美解药。它是构建一种真正意义与目的生命的完美基础。它是对抗抑郁和低自尊的完美解药。它是对抗无法接受自我或无法珍视自身特质的完美解药。它是对抗无法从人们沉迷的所有其他诱惑中辨别真正关系的完美解药。它是对抗你的生命因无力抵御巨浪而崩塌的完美解药。</p>
<p>God has sent you into the world for a greater purpose, but God knows that you cannot discover or realize this purpose unless you have a strong enough foundation to bear it, to carry it, to express it and to fulfill it. That is why the foundation building is so important and requires real time and investment on your part.</p>
<p>上帝派遣你来到这个世界是为了一个更伟大的目的，但上帝知道，除非你有足够强大的基础来承载它、携带它、表达它和实现它，否则你无法发现或实现这个目的。这就是为什么打基础如此重要，而且需要你投入实际的时间和精力。</p>
<p>The New Message from God provides this teaching, and it is so very essential. It will give you the strength and the confidence you will need and the humility that you must have to recognize your own vulnerabilities to life and the strength that you must bring forth from the well of Knowledge within yourself to meet life’s great challenges and sudden events.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息提供了这个教导，它至关重要。它将赋予你所需的实力、信心和谦逊，使你能够认识你自己在生命中的脆弱，并赋予你必须从你内在内识之井中汲取的力量，以应对生命的伟大挑战和突发事件。</p>
<p>Here you will be a source of strength for others. Here you will be able to instill confidence and inspiration in others because in the face of the real impacts of life, it is your strength, it is your character, it is your compassion and your ability that really matter. Here charm and beauty mean nothing. They are all a pretension. When it comes really down to it in life, you must be able to face it and use it beneficially.</p>
<p>在这里，你将成为他人的力量源泉。在这里，你能够为他人注入信心和灵感，因为在面对生命的真正冲击时，你的力量、你的品格、你的同情心和你的能力才是真正重要的。魅力和美貌在这里毫无意义。它们都只是虚伪的伪装。当生命真正面临挑战时，你必须能够面对它，并有效地使用它。</p>
<p>For this, you need a strong foundation. To discover your real higher purpose in life and not simply invent some pleasurable pursuit for yourself, you must have this foundation, or it will not be revealed to you. You will not be a worthy recipient. You will not be a reliable vehicle for its expression in the world.</p>
<p>为此，你需要一个坚实的基础。为了发现你生命中实际的更高宗旨，而不是简单地为你自己发明某种令人愉悦的追求，你必须拥有这个基础，否则它不会向你揭示。你将不会成为一个值得收到的接受者。你将不会成为一个在世界上表达它的可靠载体。</p>
<p>This, of course, requires a re-evaluation of your life, your goals, your expectations and your ambitions. This deep evaluation is essential, and God’s New Message teaches you how it can be done to the greatest benefit.</p>
<p>当然，这需要你重新评估你的生命、你的目标、你的期望和你的雄心壮志。这种深度的评估至关重要，而上帝的新讯息教导你如何才能做到这一点并获得最大的益处。</p>
<p>For you need Knowledge to guide you, but you need wisdom, and this wisdom comes from your own learning, your own observations of life and your own achievements, and the achievements of others. Without this wisdom, you cannot carry Knowledge in the world, you cannot express what Knowledge is giving you to express, you cannot bear its strength or its wisdom and its insight. And you will not be able to adopt the great responsibilities that having such a power will require.</p>
<p>因为你需要内识来指引你，但你需要智慧，而这种智慧来自你自身的学习，你自身对生命的观察，你自身的成就，以及他人的成就。没有这种智慧，你无法在世界上承载内识，你无法表达内识赋予你去表达的事情，你无法承载它的力量或它的智慧和它的洞察力。你将无法承担拥有这种力量所要求的伟大责任。</p>
<p>Building the Four Pillars of your life means that you are using the learning of others, you are learning from others’ experiences, from their success and their failures. You are observing others without condemnation now, trying to learn, to see what their lives are teaching you, to gain benefit from their experiences and from your own experiences.</p>
<p>构建你生命的四大支柱意味着你正在运用他人的学识，你正在从他人的经验、他们的成功和失败中学习。你现在正在不带任何谴责地观察他人，努力学习，去发现他们的生命正在教给你什么，并从他们的经验和你自己的经验中获益。</p>
<p>Here you will need very strong relationships that are not simply personality attachments or liaisons that are established to share hobbies and interests. It requires a deeper connection with people. This will enrich and strengthen your life and be a great insurance against you making critical and self-defeating decisions.</p>
<p>在这里，你需要非常牢固的关系，而不仅仅是为了分享爱好和兴趣而建立的个人依恋或联络。它需要与人建立一种更深层次的联接。这将丰富和强化你的生命，并成为你避免做出关键的、自我挫败的决定的有力保障。</p>
<p>The work ahead is substantial. It is humble. You are not going to be a superstar if you are to build the Four Pillars of your life. You cannot lose yourself in your hobbies, your interests or your obsessions if you are going to build the Four Pillars of your life. You cannot give yourself away to other people and their obsessions if you are to build the Four Pillars of your life.</p>
<p>未来的工作是实质性的。它是谦逊的。如果你要构建生命的四大支柱，你不会成为超级巨星。如果你要构建生命的四大支柱，你就不能迷失自我，沉迷于你的爱好、兴趣或执念。如果你要构建生命的四大支柱，你就不能把你自己交给别人和他们的痴迷。</p>
<p>If your life is to emerge into a greater expression and fulfill a greater destiny, you must have this foundation. It is like the launch pad for a rocket. If that launch pad fails, the rocket fails. It cannot take off. And so the infrastructure underneath that rocket becomes ever more important. It must be strong. It must be well designed. It must be able to provide its service.</p>
<p>如果你的生命要进入一种更伟大的表达，并实现更伟大的天命，你必须拥有这个基础。它就像火箭的发射台。如果发射台失灵，火箭就失败了，无法升空。因此，火箭下面的基础设施变得越来越重要。它必须坚固。它必须设计精良。它必须能够提供服务。</p>
<p>That is what you are working on every day. In the Four Pillars of your life, you realize that you are working on things every day to be strong and to be stable. Stability here is so very important, for if you are unstable all the time, nothing greater can be given to you or revealed to you. And though you may feel a deep spiritual need to know your greater purpose in life, you really do not have the stability within yourself and in your circumstances to have such a revelation occur. And you will not have the relationships there to support it. You will not have the resources that you need to be able to engage with this greater realization.</p>
<p>这就是你每天工作的方向。在你生命的四大支柱中，你意识到你每天都在工作让自己强大和稳定。在这里，稳定非常重要，因为如果你一直不稳定，就没有更伟大的事情能够被赋予或揭示给你。尽管你或许感受到一种深刻的精神需求，想要知道你生命中的更伟大目的，但你的内心和环境，实际上缺乏让这样的启示发生的稳定性。你也不会拥有支持它的关系。你也不会拥有参与这种更伟大认知所需的资源。</p>
<p>That is why to give you the promise that you have a greater purpose and a greater meaning in life, the essential elements for building the foundation for this must be provided for you. And the education must be provided for you. Otherwise, the idea of living a life of a greater purpose, greater meaning, is only a dream—beyond your reach, beyond your capabilities.</p>
<p>正因为如此，为了给你承诺，让你在生命中拥有一个更伟大目的和一个更伟大意义，构建其基础的必要要素必须为你提供。教育也必须为你提供。否则，过上一种拥有更伟大目的、更伟大意义的生命的想法，只是一个梦想——超出你的范围，超出你的能力。</p>
<p>But it is not a dream. It is the fundamental reality of your life. But it requires a very strong foundation, and this foundation must be sustained through time. This will give you strength and confidence. This will free you from dangerous obsessions. This will prevent you from falling into despair or being pulled away by the obsessions and the addictions of others.</p>
<p>但它并非一个梦。它是你生命的基本现实。但它需要一个非常坚实的基础，而且这个基础必须经受时间的考验。这将赋予你力量和信心。这将使你摆脱危险的执念。这将防止你陷入绝望，或被他人的执念和成瘾所牵引。</p>
<p>This will give you a solid track in life, and with this strength, you will feel that you are here for a greater purpose, that the power of Knowledge is with you and that you have the strength and the skill to take the greater journey that now becomes revealed to you.</p>
<p>这将为你的生命提供一条坚实的道路，带着这份力量，你将感受到你在此是为了一个更伟大目的，内识的力量与你同在，你拥有力量和技能去开展现在正在向你揭示的更伟大旅程。</p>
