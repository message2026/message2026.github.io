<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on September 3, 2007 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2007 年 9 月 3 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For centuries, people of all cultures and faiths have wondered about life in the universe, speculating and pondering on the possibilities there. What would advanced civilizations be like? What would they have achieved with their technology? How would they be able to travel within the vast distances between stars and solar systems? And have they themselves, as advanced races in the universe, overcome competition, conflict and war?</p>
<p>几个世纪以来，不同文化和信仰的人们一直在探索宇宙中的生命，推测和思考那里存在的各种可能性。先进的文明会是什么样子？他们运用他们的科技取得了哪些成就？他们如何在恒星和太阳系之间遥远的距离上旅行？作为宇宙中的先进种族，他们自身是否已经克服了竞争、冲突和战争？</p>
<p>Even today, many people believe that advanced technology is the same as advanced ethics and morality. They assume that if a race has survived over a long period of time that they have by necessity overcome the predisposition to competition, conflict and war. In addition, people project their own values upon what life might be like in the universe.</p>
<p>即使在今天，许多人仍然认为先进的技术就等同于先进的伦理道德。他们认为，如果一个种族能够长期生存，他们必然会克服竞争、冲突和战争的倾向。此外，人们还会将他们自己的价值观投射到宇宙中的生命形态上。</p>
<p>As a result of this, people project human values, human aspirations, human concerns and human ethics on their speculation about intelligent life in the universe. For many people, this results in projection of the belief in a superhuman race in the universe, for it is very difficult for people to consider there are races very different from their own, whose values and ethics are very different from their own.</p>
<p>因此，人们将人类的价值观、人类的渴望、人类的关切和人类的伦理道德投射到他们对宇宙智能生命的推测上。对许多人来说，这导致他们相信宇宙中存在一个超人类种族，因为人们很难想象存在着与他们自己截然不同、价值观和伦理道德也截然不同的种族。</p>
<p>But the projection of human values generates both hope and fear. People hope there is a more intelligent, more benevolent race of beings like us out there in the universe, who could teach us and help us and shepherd us through our difficult transition into becoming a race that is capable of functioning within a Greater Community of intelligent life.</p>
<p>但人类价值观的投射既带来了希望，也带来了恐惧。人们希望宇宙中存在一个像我们一样更聪慧、更仁慈的种族，他们能够教导我们、帮助我们，并引领我们度过艰难的过渡期，成为一个能够在智能生命大社区中运作的种族。</p>
<p>So around this, there is a great deal of hope and speculation. However, there is also fear. For if there were a humanlike race with our current values and attitudes and predispositions that is technologically advanced, they could be incredibly dangerous and destructive, even predatory in their affairs and connections with other races.</p>
<p>因此，围绕这一点，人们充满了希望和猜测。然而，恐惧也随之而来。因为如果存在一个拥有我们当前价值观、态度和倾向的类人种族，并且拥有先进的技术，那么他们在与其他种族的事务和联系中，可能会具有令人难以置信的危险性和破坏性，甚至是掠夺性的。</p>
<p>So the projection of human values can generate either hope or fear, depending on what part of the human family’s psychology and behavior you want to emphasize—the highest potential or the worst tendencies.</p>
<p>因此，人类价值观的投射可以产生希望或恐惧，这取决于你想要强调人类大家庭心理和行为的哪一部分——最高的潜力还是最坏的倾向。</p>
<p>Humanity is unprepared for the realities of life within the universe, within this Greater Community of intelligent life. For the part of the universe that your world exists in is greatly inhabited. There are many parts of even your galaxy that are uncharted, for there are very few worlds that support the evolution of intelligent life. For most worlds are barren, where life cannot take hold.</p>
<p>人类尚未准备好面对宇宙的现实，宇宙智能生命大社区的生命现实。因为你们世界所在的宇宙部分已经大量居住。甚至你们的银河系中也有许多地方尚未探索，因为很少有世界能够支持智能生命的进化。因为大多数世界都是贫瘠的，生命无法在那里扎根。</p>
<p>This is important for you to understand because you must see that your world is incredibly rich and valuable—not only rich and valuable for you, but rich and valuable for other races, who see your world as a great prize, something they want to have for themselves, a world that you must value and that you must learn to defend.</p>
<p>理解这一点对你来说很重要，因为你必须看到，你们的世界极其丰富和宝贵——不仅对你们来说是丰富和宝贵的，而且对其他种族来说也是丰富和宝贵的，他们把你们的世界视为一个伟大的奖赏，一种他们想要为他们自己拥有的东西，一个你们必须珍视并且你们必须学习捍卫的世界。</p>
<p>Of course, in the projection of human ideas, people assume that advanced technology is the equivalent of advanced ethics and morality, so it is hard for them to consider that any advanced race would want to take advantage of such a wonderful species as humanity. And over the centuries, theologians and philosophers and the general values of human culture assume that humanity is the centerpiece of Creation—God’s primary emphasis, focus and obsession.</p>
<p>当然，在人类观念的投射中，人们认为先进的科技就等同于先进的伦理道德，因此他们很难想象任何先进的种族会想要利用人类这样一个奇妙的物种。几个世纪以来，神学家、哲学家以及人类文化的普遍价值观都认为，人类是创世的核心——是上帝首要的关注点、焦点和执念。</p>
<p>All these predispositions, all these projections of values indicate that you are not yet prepared for the reality of contact. You are not yet prepared to face a Greater Community of intelligent life, which in itself represents a competitive environment on a scale you cannot even imagine.</p>
<p>所有这些先入之见，所有这些价值观投射，都表明你们尚未准备好面对接触的现实。你们尚未准备好面对一个智能生命大社区，它本身就代表着一个你们甚至无法想象规模的竞争环境。</p>
<p>You are very primitive in your thinking still, but this is understandable because you have been living in relative isolation for a very long time. When We say relative isolation, it means that your world has been visited by different races for different purposes at different times in your history. So your isolation is not complete.</p>
<p>你们的思维方式仍然非常原始，但这可以理解，因为你们长期以来一直生活在相对孤立的状态中。我们所说的相对孤立，是指在你们历史上的不同时期，不同的种族曾为了不同的目的造访过你们的世界。所以，你们的孤立并非完全的。</p>
<p>But for you, in essence, it is complete, for you know nothing of the affairs of other nations and worlds. You know nothing of the realities of living within a Greater Community of intelligent life. You do not know the rules of conduct that are established between trading nations. You do not understand the ethics of other races. You do not understand their needs or even the problems that advanced technology within itself creates for any society that can establish it.</p>
<p>但对你们来说，本质上它是完整的，因为你们对其他国家和世界的事务一无所知。你们对生活在一个智能生命大社区里的现实一无所知。你们不知道贸易国家之间建立的行为准则。你们不理解其他种族的伦理。你们不理解他们的需求，甚至不理解先进科技本身给任何能够建立它的社会带来的问题。</p>
<p>Therefore, there must be a new education here, for the projection of human wishes and fears, hopes and values, cannot prepare you for the Greater Community. Even your scientific community, which seeks to be objective in its approach, is still highly governed by these predispositions. As a result, there are many fanciful notions about what life in the universe will really be like.</p>
<p>因此，这里必须有一种新的教育，因为人类的愿望和恐惧、希望和价值观的投射，无法帮助你为大社区进行准备。即使是你们力求客观的科学界，也仍然高度受制于这些先入之见。结果，存在着许多关于宇宙生命究竟会是什么样子的奇思妙想。</p>
<p>Of course, it is hard for the scientists to imagine a technological capability so far beyond what humanity has established thus far. And so many people within the scientific community believe that certain things are just impossible, for instance, the assertion that you cannot travel faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>当然，科学家很难想象一种超越人类现有水平的科技能力。科学界有许多人认为某些事情根本不可能实现，例如，有人断言“你的旅行速度不可能超过光速”。</p>
<p>But if you could not travel faster than the speed of light, then space travel would not be possible. Yet within the Greater Community of intelligent life in which you live, there is a great deal of space travel. There is a great deal of trade, both legal and illegal, both ethical and unethical, by your standards.</p>
<p>但如果你们无法以超光速旅行，那么太空旅行就不可能实现。然而，在你们所生活的智能生命大社区里，却存在着大量的太空旅行。存在着大量的贸易，以你们的标准来看，既有合法的，也有非法的；既有道德的，也有不道德的。</p>
<p>So clearly there must be a new education, a new revelation, a new paradigm of thinking and comprehension. For you are the natives of this new world, and you have no idea what is going on beyond your shores. And yet visitors, intervening visitors from beyond your shores, are already in the world and have been here for some time.</p>
<p>所以显然，必须有一种新的教育，一种新的启示，一种新的思维和理解范式。因为你们是这个新世界的原住民，你们对你们的海岸之外正在发生什么一无所知。然而，来自你们海岸之外的来访者，介入的来访者，已经来到这个世界，并且已经在这里待了一段时间。</p>
<p>They are not governed by human values or human ethics or human morality. They are not subject to these things, for they are here for their own reasons. They are not interested in you particularly. They do not need your culture and your art and your wonderfully confusing expressions. They are here on a very serious purpose of their own. They are ready for you. They have prepared for you for some time. But you are not ready for them. You have not prepared for them, and your lack of preparation makes you incredibly vulnerable to manipulation and to deception.</p>
<p>他们不受人类价值观、人类伦理或人类道德的支配。他们不受这些事情的支配，因为他们在此是为了他们自己的原因。他们对你们并非特别感兴趣。他们不需要你们的文化、你们的艺术以及你们奇妙而令人困惑的表达。他们在此是为了他们自己一个非常严肃的目的。他们已经为你们做好了准备。他们已经为你们准备了一段时间。但你们还没有为他们做好准备。你们没有为他们做好准备，你们的缺乏准备让你们极度易受操控和欺骗。</p>
<p>Given the reality of your isolation, given the anthropocentric foundation to your thinking, given the projection of your own ideals and hopes upon the Greater Community, and especially given the condition of human societies today and their relationship with one another, you are in a very poor position as the native peoples of this one world. You are extremely vulnerable in the universe now.</p>
<p>鉴于你们孤立的现实，鉴于你们思维的人类中心主义基础，鉴于你们将自身的理想和希望投射到大社区，尤其鉴于当今人类社会的状况及其相互关系，你作为这个世界的原住民处于一个非常不利的位置。你们现在在宇宙中极其脆弱。</p>
<p>You have great defenses against one another. You have great armament and weapons of destruction against one another, but you have no defenses against the Greater Community, nor do you understand what will be necessary for you and for all people in the world, and especially for nations and religious leaders, to protect and preserve human freedom and sovereignty within this world.</p>
<p>你们彼此拥有强大的防御。你们彼此拥有强大的军备和毁灭性武器，但你们却没有针对大社区的防御，你们也不理解对于你们以及对于世界上所有民众，特别是对于国家和宗教领袖来说，为了保护和维护这个世界上的人类自由和主权，什么是必不可少的。</p>
<p>Obsessed with their own affairs, the human family is not looking to the skies, is not paying attention to the Intervention that is occurring and does not give significance to those sightings that people around the world are making on a regular basis. It is not their concern. It is amazing and incredible and unbelievable perhaps, but easily dismissed, given their preoccupations.</p>
<p>人类大家庭沉迷于他们自身的事务，不仰望天空，不关注正在发生的干预，也不重视世界各地人们定期目击的那些景象。这并非他们的关切。这或许令人惊叹、不可思议、难以置信，但考虑到他们的执念，很容易被忽视。</p>
<p>There are two great dangers facing the human family, greater than you yet realize. There is the Great Waves of change coming to the world in terms of environmental degradation, in terms of diminishing resources and the great risk of competition, conflict and war that these will generate. The second great threat to humanity is Intervention from beyond by races who are here to seek the world for its resources, who are here to use humanity and to establish this world as part of their network for its strategic and biological value.</p>
<p>人类大家庭面临两大危险，远超你们目前所意识到的。一是变革的巨浪即将降临世界，表现为环境恶化，表现为资源缩减，以及由此将引发的竞争、冲突和战争的巨大风险。人类面临的第二大威胁是来自外来种族的干预，他们来此是为了掠夺这个世界的资源，他们来此是为了利用人类，并将这个世界确立为他们网络的一部分，以获取其战略和生物价值。</p>
<p>These are the greatest events in human history. These are the most perilous threats to human freedom and sovereignty. These are the most consequential events in human history, and yet how few people ever think of these things? How few people concern themselves with these things? It is not part of the public agenda of any government. It is not the concern of world religious leaders or institutions, at least not publicly.</p>
<p>这些是人类历史上最伟大的事件。这些是对人类自由和主权最危险的威胁。这些是人类历史上最具影响力的事件，然而，却又有多少人思考过这些事情？又有多少人关心过这些事情？这不是任何政府的公共议程的一部分。这也不是全球宗教领袖或机构关注的事情，至少在公开场合并非如此。</p>
<p>The problems that humanity is concerned with, though real in and of themselves, are insignificant compared to these two great challenges. For what could you hope to accomplish or to protect or gain if human freedom and sovereignty is lost through the clever Intervention of other races? And what can you hope to achieve in terms of averting poverty and building human wealth and human security if you cannot face the Great Waves of change that are occurring here in the world, which are largely the result of humanity’s abuse of the world itself?</p>
<p>人类所关注的问题，尽管本身实际存在，但与这两大挑战相比却微不足道。因为，如果人类的自由和主权因其他种族的巧妙干预而丧失，你还能指望成就、保护或获得什么呢？如果你无法面对正在这个世界上发生的巨浪——这很大程度上是人类滥用世界本身的结果——你还能指望在避免贫困、构建人类财富和人类安全方面取得什么成就呢？</p>
<p>Your challenges now are greater, and you must prepare for them. And these two great challenges are not unrelated. For those intervening in the world today, who represent commercial forces, will support humanity’s decline, for that will make their proposition of governance far easier for them to establish, either surreptitiously or publicly or both. A weakened humanity will have difficulty declining the offers of an advanced race, and the more that humanity has fallen prey to conflict and war and destitution, the greater will be the attraction of the Intervention’s offers and proposals.</p>
<p>你现在的挑战更加巨大，你必须为它们进行准备。这两大挑战并非毫无关联。因为那些代表商业势力、正在干预当今世界的种族，将支持人类的衰落，因为这将使他们的治理主张更容易建立，无论是秘密的、公开的，还是两者兼而有之。一个被弱化的人类将难以拒绝一个先进种族的提议，人类越是沦为冲突、战争和贫困的牺牲品，干预的提议和建议的吸引力就越大。</p>
<p>Already today the Intervention is grooming its advocates and apologists to promote an extraterrestrial guidance for the world. Already today the Intervention is establishing its bases in the world and influencing certain select individuals in positions of power and influence—in government, in commerce and in religion.</p>
<p>如今，干预已经在培养它的拥护者和辩护者，以推广一种针对世界的外星指导。如今，干预已经在世界上建立其基地，并影响着某些身居权力和影响力位置的精选个体——在政府、商业和宗教领域。</p>
<p>Certain people are obsessed with conspiracy theories, but their focus is misguided. The malevolent behavior of human governments or human commercial institutions is nothing compared to what the Intervention can do here. And if its agenda succeeds, which remains yet uncertain, there will be no winners amongst the human family. There will be no vaulted societies. There will be no humans in positions of power and authority. Everyone will be used, and everyone will share the same fate. For the Intervention is intelligent. It does not seek to destroy humanity but to employ it for its own purposes.</p>
<p>某些人痴迷于阴谋论，但他们的焦点被误导了。人类政府或人类商业机构的恶意行为与干预在此所能造成的后果相比根本不值一提。如果干预者的议程成功实现（尽管这仍不确定），人类大家庭中将没有赢家。没有高高在上的社会，也没有处于权力和权威位置的人类。每个人都会被利用，每个人都会共享相同的命运。因为干预是智能的。它不是要摧毁人类，而是利用人类来达到它自身的目的。</p>
<p>The Intervention’s view of humanity is cold and calculating and unsympathetic. It views you as chaotic and destructive. It does not know of individual freedom. Individual freedom is unknown to this Intervention. It sees you are destroying this magnificent world—a world it seeks to have for itself, a world it firmly believes it can manage far better than you.</p>
<p>干预对人类的看法是冷酷、算计且无情的。它视你们为混乱且破坏性的。它不知道个人自由。个人自由对这个干预而言是未知的。它看到你们正在毁灭这个宏伟的世界——一个它试图为它自己拥有的世界，一个它坚信自己能够比你们管理得更好的世界。</p>
<p>Yet do not ever think that their governance of the world would lead to advantage for humanity. You have no idea of what harsh conditions it would create. Everything that humanity has ever created that has been beneficial—in its philosophy, in its sociology, in its political arena, in its art—would be destroyed. You would be slaves to a foreign power, a foreign power that is cruel and exacting—quite unlike what you believe an advanced civilization would do or be.</p>
<p>然而，千万不要认为他们对世界的治理会给人类带来益处。你们根本不知道这会造成多么严酷的境况。人类曾经创造的一切有益之物——无论是在哲学、社会学、政治舞台还是艺术领域——都将被毁灭。你们将沦为一个外来势力的奴隶，一个残酷苛刻的外国势力——这与你们所认为的先进文明的所作所为截然不同。</p>
<p>And this Intervention is not being generated from your neighbors in the Greater Community, for the rules of conduct in this part of the universe do not allow for conquest of other worlds, other inhabited worlds where there is a native race. Those intervening in the world today are mercenary. They are resource explorers and economic collectives, groups that are not highly regarded, even amongst your neighboring worlds in the Greater Community. They are scavengers.</p>
<p>这种干预并非源自你们大社区的邻居，因为宇宙这一部分的行为准则不允许征服其他世界，其他有原住民族居住的世界。当今干预世界的种族是雇佣兵。他们是资源探索者和经济集体，即使在你们大社区的邻近世界，这些群体也不受重视。他们是拾荒者。</p>
<p>They will present themselves as noble, and they will use your spirituality and your spiritual idealism to paint themselves as liberators, as emancipators, as almost angelic. But they are nothing more than opportunists. And this world and humanity is the opportunity. And there is more than one group that is intervening in the world today.</p>
<p>他们会把他们自己标榜为高尚之人，利用你们的精神性和你们的精神理想主义，把他们自己描绘成解放者、拯救者，甚至近乎天使。但他们不过是机会主义者。而这个世界和人类本身就是机会。而且，当今世界，干预的团体不止一个。</p>
<p>As long as humanity appears to not be rejecting the Intervention or fighting it visibly, the rules of conduct in your part of the Galaxy will not prevent their participation here.</p>
<p>只要人类表现出不拒绝干预或明显地反抗干预，你们银河系的行为准则就不会阻止他们参与其中。</p>
<p>Some people say, “Well, if another race wants to take over, they will just invade, take over!” But you see, this is not how things work in the Greater Community. If you were living in a very remote area and there were no rules of engagement regarding trade, commerce and interaction between worlds, yes, that is possible. But this more reflects your values and the limits of your awareness.</p>
<p>有些人说：“好吧，如果另一个种族想要接管，他们就会入侵，接管！”但你看，大社区里的事情并非如此。如果你生活在一个非常偏远的地区，那里没有关于贸易、商业和世界间互动的规则，是的，这是可能的。但这更多地反映了你们的价值观和你们觉知的局限。</p>
<p>For worlds such as yours could be taken over without firing a shot. Take advantage of the natives’ conflicts and their superstitions, paint yourselves as gods and emancipators, assist them in their own decline and their own conflicts, and you can step into the corridors of power very easily. It just takes time. It has to be done gradually.</p>
<p>因为像你们这样的世界，无需费一枪一弹就能被占领。利用当地人的冲突和迷信，把他们自己描绘成神明和解放者，在他们自身的衰落和冲突中助纣为虐，你就能轻而易举地步入权力的殿堂。它只需要时间。它必须循序渐进。</p>
<p>The Intervention does not seek to destroy the world’s resources. They even view humanity as one of the world’s resources. Though they would seek to limit your population, they do not want to destroy you. You are a part of the resources of the world to them.</p>
<p>干预并非寻求摧毁世界资源。他们甚至将人类视为世界资源之一。尽管他们会寻求限制你们的人口，但他们并不想毁灭你们。对他们来说，你们是世界资源的一部分。</p>
<p>Do you see? As above, so below. Do you think the universe is full of enlightened beings? How can you be so foolish to think these things? Do you think other races are fascinated with humanity, as if your idiosyncracies are just a delight to other races? Do you really believe that advanced technology liberates you from having to survive in a competitive environment and having to gain access to resources?</p>
<p>你看到了吗？上行如是，下行亦然。你认为宇宙中充满了觉悟者吗？你怎么会这么愚蠢地想这些事情？你认为其他种族会对人类着迷吗？仿佛你们的特质只是其他种族的乐趣？你真的相信先进科技能把你们从竞争激烈的环境中解放出来，让你们不必为了获取资源而挣扎求生吗？</p>
<p>Such foolish thinking. And yet such foolish thinking is prevalent in the world today amongst the very few people who even think about these things, who are even aware that contact is already occurring.</p>
<p>多么愚蠢的想法。然而，这种愚蠢的想法在当今世界却盛行，只有极少数人会思考这些事情，甚至察觉到接触已经发生。</p>
<p>There are people, unelected officials in your governments, who know these things, but the population is still ignorant and self-obsessed and has not yet been prepared for the realities of the Greater Community.</p>
<p>你们政府中有些人，未经选举的官员，知道这些事情，但民众依然无知、自我痴迷，尚未为大社区的现实做好准备。</p>
<p>You are the virgin child in a big metropolis. You must learn wisdom and restraint, discretion and discernment. For there are three things that all worlds in the universe must establish if they are to remain free from outside domination. They must be united. They must be self-sufficient. And they must be extremely discreet.</p>
<p>你是大都市里的处女。你必须学会​​智慧与克制，谨慎与辨别力。因为宇宙中的所有世界若想保持不受外界支配，就必须建立三件事：它们必须团结一致。它们必须自给自足。它们必须极其谨慎。</p>
<p>You can see right away that humanity has not met any of these three conditions. You are not united. You are destroying your self-sufficiency as fast as you possibly can by degrading the sustainability of your world’s resources. And you are projecting all of your communications out into space where they can be easily discerned by the discreet observer. You are living, then, in a fool’s paradise regarding the Greater Community.</p>
<p>你一眼就能看出，人类根本未能满足这三个条件。你们并不团结。你们正在以最快的速度摧毁你们自给自足的能力，通过降低你们世界资源的可持续性。你们还在把你们所有的交流投射到太空中，让任何谨慎的观察者都能轻易辨别。因此，你们生活在一个关于大社区的愚昧天堂里。</p>
<p>Now you must understand that the Greater Community contains intelligent life at all levels of technological and ethical development. Not everyone in the Greater Community is predatory. But as it is within the world, there are individuals and groups representing many different agendas, motivated by a broad range of intentions.</p>
<p>现在你必须理解，大社区包含着处于各个科技和伦理发展水平的智能生命。并非大社区中的每个种族都是掠夺性的。但正如世界内部一样，存在着代表着许多不同议程的个体和团体，它们被各种各样的意图所驱动。</p>
<p>The critical thing that you must know now, if you have the strength and the courage to consider these things, is that advanced technology creates an increased need for resources. Worlds that outstrip their own self-sufficiency now must travel abroad to find what they need. And when they do, to the extent that they do or are able to, they will become influenced by other worlds. They can become dominated by other worlds.</p>
<p>如果你有力量和勇气去思考这些事情，那么现在你必须知道的关键一点是，先进的科技会创造对资源的更大需求。那些超出他们自身自给自足能力的世界现在必须到国外去寻找它们所需的资源。而当它们这样做的时候，在它们能够做到或可以做到的范围内，它们将受到其他世界的影响。它们可能被其他世界所主宰。</p>
<p>You enter then a competitive environment, functioning with races whose existence is far longer than your own, who have learned wisdom in the Greater Community, which you as humanity, the young virgin, have not.</p>
<p>你们随后进入一个竞争环境，与那些存在时间比你们长得多的种族一起生活，他们在大社区中学习到了智慧，而你作为人类，年轻的处女，却没有。</p>
<p>Never think that you can go out and plant your flags beyond this solar system, that the universe is there for the taking—a big empty space for you to claim for yourselves. For these places are already owned by others.</p>
<p>千万不要认为你们可以走出去，在太阳系之外插上你们的旗帜，宇宙就在那里，正等待着你们去占领——一片巨大的空旷空间，正等待着你们去占领。因为这些地方早已被他人占有。</p>
<p>There has to be a growing up here. You cannot be adolescent and hope to succeed in transitioning into the Greater Community. You cannot be enamored with your own power and skill and sense of self-importance if you are to venture out into an environment like this. You also cannot be predatory, for other nations far more powerful than you will oppose you.</p>
<p>这里必须有一个成长。你不能以青少年的身份期望成功过渡到大社区。如果你要冒险进入这样的环境，你就不能迷恋你自身的力量、技能和自我重要感。你也不能掠夺成性，因为远比你们强大的其他国家会反对你们。</p>
<p>Consider again the three requirements to maintain freedom and sovereignty within this world. You must be united. You must be self-sufficient. You must be extremely discreet. If you can establish these, which at this point appears to be a great challenge, then other worlds will respect you and will respect your boundaries and will respect your sovereignty.</p>
<p>再次思考维护这个世界的自由和主权的三个要求。你们必须团结。你们必须自给自足。你们必须极其谨慎。如果你们能够建立这些，这在目前看来是一个伟大的挑战，那么其他世界将会尊重你们，尊重你们的界限，尊重你们的主权。</p>
<p>However, if you do not demonstrate these three fundamental requirements sufficiently, then others will think you are chaotic and you are ruining a beautiful world, and nothing will prevent them from intervening. This is true even of noble races in your neighborhood in the universe.</p>
<p>然而，如果你们没有充分体现这三个基本要求，那么其他种族就会认为你们制造了混乱，正在毁灭一个美好的世界，而且没有什么能阻止他们进行干预。即使是你们宇宙中邻近的贵族，情况也是如此。</p>
<p>Now it is true that humanity does have potential allies in the Greater Community, but they are not intervening here. They recognize that humanity is not yet ready for Contact, for you have not even begun to establish the three requirements.</p>
<p>诚然，人类在大社区里确实拥有潜在的盟友，但他们并未介入。他们认识到人类尚未准备好接触，因为你们甚至还没有开始确立那三个要求。</p>
<p>They will not come and share their technology with you because they know that you would turn it into weaponry, and it would only endanger the human family even more.</p>
<p>他们不会来与你们分享他们的技术，因为他们知道你们会把它变成武器，这只会给人类大家庭带来更大的危险。</p>
<p>They will not come and teach you peace because you would reject them, and you would misuse their offerings. You would either hold them up to be deities, or you would try to fight them.</p>
<p>他们不会来教你们和平，因为你们会拒绝他们，会滥用他们的产品。你们要么把他们奉为神明，要么试图与他们对抗。</p>
<p>They will send their wisdom from afar, which they have as the Allies of Humanity, but they will not come.</p>
<p>他们将从远方送来他们的智慧，作为人类的盟友，但他们不会到来。</p>
<p>To cross over the threshold from isolation to participation in the Greater Community will be the greatest challenge that humanity has ever faced. And you must meet the three requirements to succeed in crossing over this threshold. If you fail, then your future is certain.</p>
<p>跨越从孤立到参与大社区的门槛，将是人类迄今面临的最大挑战。而你们必须满足三个要求才能成功跨越这个门槛。如果你们失败了，那么你们的未来也是确定的。</p>
<p>Humanity must become united. It must become self-sufficient. Self-sufficiency means that you do not rely upon other races to provide you the basic resources that you need to live. You do not become dependent upon foreign powers or upon predatory groups, such as those who are intervening in the world today, who will sell you anything—be it legal or illegal—and will take anything from you—be it legal or illegal in the affairs of the Greater Community.</p>
<p>人类必须团结起来。它必须自给自足。自给自足意味着你们不依赖其他种族提供你们生存所需的基本资源。你们不会依赖外来势力或掠夺性团体，比如那些正在当今世界进行的干预者，他们会向你们出售任何东西——无论合法还是非法——并从你们那里拿走任何东西——无论在大社区事务中是合法还是非法的。</p>
<p>You should also understand that there is no central authority governing life in the universe. There are regional bodies who oversee trade and commerce to maintain order, but their reach is limited. They govern trade routes and have forums for different nations to communicate with each other and to establish treaties, but they do not rule. There is no empire ruling the universe. That is ridiculous.</p>
<p>你也应该理解，宇宙中不存在一个统治生命的中央权威。有一些区域机构负责监管贸易和商业，维持秩序，但它们的影响力有限。它们管理贸易路线，为不同国家提供交流和缔结条约的平台，但它们并不统治。宇宙中不存在一个帝国。这太荒谬了。</p>
<p>Over millennia, nations who have advanced technologies have been able to create a greater stability based on practical needs. And within this environment, such as the environment in which your world exists, outright war is rare. Conflicts do erupt and are sometimes resolved through diplomacy, and usually resolved in this way. In more distant outlying regions, there are direct conflicts between worlds, but nothing that engulfs large parts of the universe.</p>
<p>几千年来，拥有先进科技的国家能够基于实际需求创造更大的稳定。在这样的环境中，例如你们世界所处的环境中，直接的战争很少发生。冲突确实会爆发，有时会通过外交手段解决，而且通常都是通过外交手段解决。在更遥远的边远地区，世界之间会发生直接冲突，但不会像宇宙中的大部分地区那样发生大规模冲突。</p>
<p>There are people in the world today who still think you are going to go out and just conquer what you want. Such foolishness. You have no idea what you are dealing with. The young adolescent thinks they are going to go out and take the world by storm. They think the world is going to open before them and that their pathway will be generously supported by life itself.</p>
<p>如今世上仍有人认为，只要走出去，就能征服你想要的一切。真是愚蠢至极。你根本不知道你正在面对什么。青春期的青少年认为他们会走出去，征服世界。他们认为世界会在他们面前展开，生命会慷慨地扶持他们前行。</p>
<p>Yet when they enter real life, they face the problem of meeting their practical needs of self-sufficiency. They realize that other people do not care about them or are interested in them and that there are some who will exploit them and even harm them.</p>
<p>然而，当他们步入实际生命时，却面临着满足自给自足这一实际需求的问题。他们意识到其他人并不关心他们，也不对他们感兴趣，有些人甚至会利用他们，伤害他们。</p>
<p>This is a good analogy, for you are entering the Greater Community. And you enter the Greater Community not because you yourself feel ready to enter the Greater Community. You enter the Greater Community because the Greater Community is intervening in your world.</p>
<p>这是一个很好的比喻，因为你们正在进入大社区。而你们进入大社区，并非因为你们自己觉得准备好了。你们进入大社区，是因为大社区正在干预你们的世界。</p>
<p>And why is this happening now? people ask. Why not 100 years ago? 500 years ago? Why now? It is a good question. But it has an obvious answer because humanity has established a communications and commercial network and a technology that other races can use.</p>
<p>人们会问，为什么现在会发生这种事？为什么不是100年前？500年前？为什么是现在？这是个好问题。但答案显而易见，因为人类已经建立了通讯和商业网络，以及其他种族可以使用的技术。</p>
<p>Since you are part of the resource, they wait for you to build the infrastructure, and then they will come and take it for themselves. This represents a greater degree of cleverness and patience than most people can entertain at this moment.</p>
<p>既然你们是资源的一部分，他们就等着你们把基础设施​​建好，然后他们来占为己有。这代表着更大的聪明才智和更强的耐心，而大多数人此时此刻还无法做到。</p>
<p>So you are facing two great threats. You are facing a world of diminishing resources, a world of violent weather, a world whose planetary environment has been disrupted sufficiently now to create a grave threat to the well-being of all peoples. And you are facing competition from beyond the world.</p>
<p>所以，你们正面临两大威胁。你们正面临一个资源日益减少的世界，一个气候异常的世界，一个地球环境已遭受严重破坏，足以对所有人类福祉构成严重威胁的世界。此外，你们还面临来自世界之外的竞争。</p>
<p>Terrifying, overwhelming, it seems at first. You can hardly even be with it, it is so big. You want to run away and hide, get under the covers and pull them over your head. You want to go into denial and claim it is not true.</p>
<p>乍一看，它令人恐惧，势不可挡。它如此巨大，你几乎无法承受。你想逃跑，躲起来，钻进被子里，蒙住头。你想否认这一切，声称这不是真的。</p>
<p>You want to say that God is going to come and save you, or Jesus is going to return, or Muhammad will return to rectify and resolve the situation. You think these things because you feel inadequate and unprepared. So God sends a New Message into the world to give you this adequacy and this preparation because it is the greatest need in the world today.</p>
<p>你想说上帝会来拯救你，或者耶稣会再来，或者穆罕默德会回来纠正和解决局势。你之所以会有这些想法，是因为你觉得自己不足，没有准备好。所以上帝向世界发送了一条新讯息，赋予你这种充足性和准备，因为这是当今世界最大的需求。</p>
<p>With this understanding, you will look at human conflict very differently. You will look at areas of the world that are in conflict very differently. You will see that humanity cannot afford war, for any reason. You will see that humanity must protect and preserve and distribute equitably the world’s resources—not because it is the right thing to do but because it is necessary now.</p>
<p>有了这种理解，你将会以截然不同的眼光看待人类冲突。你将会以截然不同的眼光看待世界上处于冲突中的地区。你将会看见，人类无论出于何种原因都无法承受战争。你将会看见，人类必须保护、维护并公平地分配世界资源——并非因为这是正确的做法，而是因为现在它是必要的。</p>
<p>These two great threats have the power to unite humanity in its own defense, for nothing else at this point will unite humanity. Thus, in your adversity, you find a great opportunity—a great gift, if you will, a greater possibility.</p>
<p>这两大威胁拥有将人类团结起来进行自我防御的力量，因为在此刻，没有任何其他力量能够团结人类。因此，在你们的逆境中，你们发现了一个伟大的机遇——一份伟大的礼物，或者说，一种更伟大的可能性。</p>
<p>So once you get over your fear and denial and all your bargaining and all this foolishness, then you can begin to look and see.</p>
<p>因此，一旦你克服了恐惧和否认以及所有的讨价还价和所有这些愚蠢行为，你就可以开始观察和洞察。</p>
<p>What is the Peace Initiative for humanity? The Peace Initiative for humanity is to prepare to deal with the Great Waves of change, to offset the Intervention and to prepare for life in the universe. And how is humanity going to prepare for the universe? It is going to need a Revelation from God to help you. It is also going to need Wisdom and Knowledge from the universe itself to help you, for there is a lot of practical wisdom that humanity, both its leaders and its population, must assume adequately to be able to function within this larger environment in such a way that you can maintain your freedom and sovereignty within this world.</p>
<p>人类和平倡议是什么？人类和平倡议是为了准备应对变革的巨浪，抵消干预，并为宇宙生命进行准备。人类将如何为宇宙进行准备？它将需要来自上帝的一个启示来帮助你们。它还将需要来自宇宙本身的智慧和内识来帮助你们，因为人类，包括它的领导者和它的民众，必须充分地运用大量的实践智慧，才能在这个更大的环境中运作，从而能够维护你们在这个世界上的自由和主权。</p>
<p>The New Message from God brings God’s Wisdom and Encouragement and a great warning. But it also brings Knowledge and Wisdom from the Greater Community that you will need, for you do not know how to build a presence in the universe. You do not understand Greater Community affairs. You do not understand the rules of conduct that govern trade in this part of the universe in which your world has always existed. You do not understand the difference between your neighbors and those who would intervene in the world.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息带来了上帝的智慧、鼓励和一个重大的警示。但它也带来了你们所需要的来自大社区的内识和智慧，因为你们不知道如何在宇宙中构建一个存在。你们不理解大社区事务。你们不理解在你们的世界始终存在于其中的这个宇宙区域里，统治着贸易的行为规则。你们不理解你们的邻居和那些想要干预世界的种族之间的区别。</p>
<p>This is practical wisdom. This is Wisdom from the Greater Community. And the New Message from God has brought into the world Wisdom from the Greater Community, as well as the Divine inspiration, as well as a new teaching about human spirituality—humanity’s One Spirituality that is at the heart of all your world’s religions.</p>
<p>这是实用的智慧。这是来自大社区的智慧。来自上帝的新讯息给世界带来了来自大社区的智慧，以及神圣的灵感，以及关于人类精神性的新教导——人类唯一的精神性，它是你们世界所有宗教的核心。</p>
<p>For the emphasis now must be on human unity, human self-sufficiency and human discretion and discernment regarding the Greater Community. For the future is here. The universe is not waiting for you. It is already at your doorstep. It is already looking into your windows. It is already flying through your skies. Avoid this, neglect this, deny this, and you will cast your future. This is how important this is.</p>
<p>因为现在的重点必须放在人类团结、人类自给自足以及人类对大社区的审慎和辨识力上。因为未来就在这里。宇宙并非在等待你们。它已然来到你们的家门口。它已然在窥视你们的窗户。它已然在飞过你们的天空。回避它，忽视它，否认它，你们将决定你们的未来。这是多么重要。</p>
<p>What could God give to the world now that the world needs beyond anything but a New Message to teach you about human unity, self-sufficiency, discernment and discretion regarding the Greater Community?</p>
<p>既然世界现在最需要的不仅仅是一条新讯息，来教导你们关于人类团结、自给自足、关于大社区的辨别力和审慎力，那么上帝能给予世界什么呢？</p>
<p>Without this, the human family will decline. It will enter a period of prolonged conflict, leading nations and peoples into a state of destitution. And the Intervention that is here today will silently gain the reins of power. It will cultivate people to believe that only it can guarantee humanity’s redemption, that only it can establish a peaceful and harmonious existence for the human family, that only the Intervention itself can redeem humanity and save it from itself.</p>
<p>没有这个讯息，人类大家庭将会衰落。它将进入一个长期冲突的时期，带领各国和各国人民陷入贫困。而今天在此的干预将默默地获得权力。它将培养人们相信，只有它才能为人类大家庭创造和平和谐的生存环境，只有干预本身才能救赎人类，将人类从自身中拯救出来。</p>
<p>Already these messages have been sent and are being sent into the world through certain human representatives who have become advocates and apologists for the Intervention. They will claim that without this extraterrestrial guidance and governance, humanity is hopeless—hopelessly corrupt, hopelessly divided, hopelessly inept—and that only the governance and guidance of those marvelous visitors, those gracious spiritual entities, the Intervention, can save a struggling humanity.</p>
<p>这些讯息已经通过某些已成为干预倡导者和辩护者的人类代表被发送到世界上，并且正在被发送到世界上。他们将声称，没有这种外星指引和治理，人类将无望——无望地腐败，无望地分裂，无望地无能——并且只有那些非凡的探访者、那些仁慈的精神实体、干预的治理和指引，才能拯救苦苦挣扎的人类。</p>
<p>Humanity cannot prepare itself for the Greater Community. Humanity does need assistance, but not from invasive, manipulative powers from the Greater Community.</p>
<p>人类无法为大社区做好准备。人类确实需要援助，但并非来自大社区的侵略性、操纵性力量。</p>
<p>Humanity needs God’s guidance, and it needs Knowledge and Wisdom from the Greater Community. For humanity must save itself. Humanity must establish itself. Humanity must unite itself and establish its self-sufficiency in the universe. Humanity must learn to be discreet and discerning. And only a New Message from God—not from an extraterrestrial power but from God, the Creator of all life—can give this to you.</p>
<p>人类需要上帝的指引，需要来自大社区的内识和智慧。因为人类必须拯救它自己。人类必须建立它自己。人类必须团结起来，在宇宙中建立起自给自足。人类必须学习谨慎和辨识。而只有一条来自上帝的新讯息——不是来自一个外星力量，而是来自上帝，所有生命的创造者——能够赋予你们这些。</p>
<p>For even your most brilliant and educated individuals—in the political arena, in the sciences, in the humanities—have no idea what is coming over the horizon. They do not even know what is happening here now. So immersed they are in obsessive concern for humanity’s issues and problems and dilemmas, they do not see what is at their doorstep. They do not see what is coming over the horizon. They are living in their own little world, ignorant and unaware of what is happening around it, and even within it.</p>
<p>因为即使是你们最聪明、最有教养的人——在政坛、在科学界、在人文领域——也不知道地平线上会发生什么。他们甚至不知道此刻这里正在发生什么。他们如此沉浸于对人类问题、难题和困境的过度关注，以至于看不到他们家门口正在发生什么。他们看不到地平线上正在发生什么。他们生活在他们自己的小世界里，对周围，甚至内部正在发生什么一无所知，浑然不知。</p>
<p>The New Message from God has come, then, to prepare humanity, for humanity must be prepared if it is to have a future—if it is to [maintain] human freedom and sovereignty in this world in the face of the Greater Community, if it is to end its ceaseless conflicts and to establish a cooperation that is built not upon a shared ideology, but upon the recognition of necessity.</p>
<p>因此，来自上帝的新讯息已经到来，是为了让人类进行准备，因为人类必须进行准备，如果它想要拥有一个未来——如果它想要在面对大社区时，在这个世界上维护人类的自由和主权，如果人类想要结束它无休止的冲突，并建立一种合作，这种合作并非建立在共同的意识形态上，而是建立在对必要性的认知上。</p>
<p>It is not what humanity wants. It is what humanity must do. And this “must” will organize human activity, human awareness and human cooperation based on necessity—not upon fantasy or desire or wishes or religious edicts or ideologies. Humanity must do certain things or it will fail, and if it fails, it will be overtaken. That is certain.</p>
<p>它不是人类想要的。它是人类必须做的。而这“必须”将基于必要性——而非基于幻想、渴望、愿望、宗教法令或意识形态——来组织人类活动、人类觉知和人类合作。人类必须做某些事，否则它就会失败，而如果它失败了，它就会被超越。这是肯定的。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must learn about the Greater Community, and you must learn about the Great Waves of change. Receive, then, God’s Revelation, for only it can prepare you and alert you and encourage you and ignite the deeper spiritual Knowledge that God has placed within each person to guide and to protect them—a Knowledge that has yet been discovered by so few within your world, a Knowledge that will be necessary now, to see and to know and to take the steps of preparation that are necessary.</p>
<p>因此，你必须学习大社区，你必须学习变革的巨浪。因此，接收上帝的启示吧，因为唯有它能够准备你们、警示你们、鼓励你们，并点燃上帝置于每个人内在以指引和保护他们的更深层次的精神内识——这个内识在你们的世界中尚未被极少数人发现，这个内识现在将是必要的，以便去看见、去知道，并采取必要的准备步骤。</p>
<p>For the hour is late. And humanity does not have much time. Time now is of the essence. What will make the difference is inspired individuals and small groups of individuals. Not everyone is going to awaken to this. Not everyone is going to learn to prepare. So it is up to those individuals and small groups of people to establish this emphasis upon human unity and cooperation and the recognition of necessity.</p>
<p>因为时间已晚。人类没有多少时间了。现在时间至关重要。能够带来改变的是那些受到启发的个人和小群体。并非每个人都会意识到这一点。并非每个人都会学会做好准备。因此，建立对人类团结与合作以及对必要性的认知的重视，取决于这些个人和小群体。</p>
<p>You must see that those who are flying around in your skies are not tourists. They are not here on a science project. They are not part of some university project from some other world. They are resource explorers.</p>
<p>你必须看见，那些在你们天空中飞行的生物并非游客。他们来这里不是为了某个科学项目。他们也不是来自其他星球的某个大学项目的成员。他们是资源勘探者。</p>
<p>Read about this. Learn about this. And do not be deceived by the Intervention and its claims of spirituality and nobility. Do not believe it is here to save humanity. Its intentions are far more prosaic.</p>
<p>阅读这个。学习这个。不要被干预及其宣称的精神性和高尚所欺骗。不要相信它来此是为了拯救人类。它的意图远比这更平淡无奇。</p>
<p>Nature is competitive. The competition for environment is part of nature. Nature exists throughout the universe. Do not think that the laws of nature do not hold true for other races, regardless of their technology. Do not think that technology will save you, or you will give yourself to a race who is technologically superior to you.</p>
<p>自然界充满竞争。对环境的竞争是自然的一部分。自然存在于整个宇宙。不要认为自然法则不适用于其他种族，无论他们的科技如何。不要认为科技会拯救你们，或者你把你自己交给一个科技比你们更优越的种族。</p>
<p>All these things that are being shared with you here are part of gaining a Greater Community awareness and understanding, which is so greatly needed now. When you begin to see this, it will be clear as day to you. But you must begin to see it, and you must stay with seeing it.</p>
<p>这里与你分享的所有这些，都是获得大社区觉知和理解的一部分，而这在当下是极其必要的。当你开始看到这一点时，它对你来说将清晰如白昼。但你必须开始看到它，并且必须坚持看到它。</p>
<p>You must look and look and look. And then you can gain an understanding. And the New Message will help you gain this understanding. And you will see that this understanding is not some fantastic or distorted view of reality, but it is reality itself and that it coincides with everything that you know about nature and everything that history has taught you about the nature of interventions, which are always carried out for self-interest.</p>
<p>你必须观察、观察、再观察。然后你才能获得理解。新讯息将帮助你获得这种理解。你将看到，这种理解并非某种奇异或扭曲的现实观，而是现实本身，它与你所知的关于自然的一切，以及历史教给你的关于干预本质的一切相吻合，而干预总是为了自身利益而进行。</p>
<p>The New Message wants to amplify your worldly wisdom and give it greater scope and application within a Greater Community context. It wants to amplify what Knowledge within you is already telling you and has always been telling you.</p>
<p>新讯息想要放大你的世俗智慧，并赋予它在大社区背景下更广阔的视野和应用。它想要放大你内在内识已经告诉你的、以及一直在告诉你的事情。</p>
<p>It wants you to outgrow your fantasies, and your preferences, and your self-obsessions so that you can see the movement of life—both within your world and in the Greater Community itself. It wants your religions to be based on Knowledge, not upon the belief in heroes and heroines, not upon the absurd assertion of absolute ideas.</p>
<p>它希望你超越你的空想、你的偏好和你的自我痴迷，这样你才能看到生命的运动——既在你们的世界中，也在大社区之中。它希望你的宗教基于内识，而非基于对英雄的信仰，而非基于对绝对想法的荒谬断言。</p>
<p>For no one in the world knows the Mind of God or what God is doing now. Never think that God’s Revelations to humanity are complete, for they must be ongoing. And these Revelations are given at critical times in history to prepare humanity to meet a great challenge and to use a great opportunity.</p>
<p>因为世上无人知晓上帝的心意，也无人知晓上帝此刻正在做什么。切勿认为上帝给予人类的启示是完整的，因为它们必定是持续不断的。这些启示是在历史的关键时刻赐予人类，为的是帮助人类做好准备，迎接伟大挑战，并使用一种伟大的机会。</p>
<p>The great challenge before you now is facing the Great Waves of change in the world with all of your energy and commitment, and to face the reality of the Intervention and the Greater Community with all of your energy and commitment.</p>
<p>你现在面临的伟大挑战是用你所有的能量和承诺去面对世界的变革巨浪，用你所有的精力和承诺去面对干预和大社区的现实。</p>
<p>The opportunity for you is to escape from the Hell of your own self-obsession, to end human conflict, to generate human unity based upon necessity, upon a Greater Community awareness, to meet the Great Waves of change and to offset their great hazards; and to turn your defenses against the Greater Community, for you must protect the world from Intervention. For there is Intervention now and there will be Intervention in the future.</p>
<p>你们的机会是逃离你们自我痴迷的地狱，结束人类冲突，基于必要性、基于大社区觉知来构建人类团结，应对变革的巨浪并抵消它们的巨大危害；并将你们的防御转向大社区，因为你们必须保护世界免遭干预。因为现在有干预，未来也将有干预。</p>
<p>If you are to be free, if you are to be respected, if you are to be a sovereign race in the Greater Community, you must learn to establish your boundaries in space. You may claim authority over this solar system, but no more. That is the limit to God’s endowment for humanity. If you seek control beyond this, then you will become an aggressive and predatory nation in the universe, and others will oppose you, and eventually you will fall.</p>
<p>如果你们想要自由，如果你们想要受人尊敬，如果你们想要成为大社区中的一个主权种族，你们就必须学会在太空中确立你们的界限。你们可以宣称对这个太阳系拥有权威，但仅此而已。这是上帝赋予人类的极限。如果你们寻求超越此界限的控制，那么你们将成为宇宙中一个侵略性和掠夺性的国家，其他种族将反对你们，最终你们将衰亡。</p>
<p>You have certain rights. But you have certain responsibilities too. Do not claim these rights without claiming these responsibilities, or you will not realize what you are doing.</p>
<p>你们拥有某些权利，但你们也承担某些责任。切勿只主张这些权利而不承担这些责任，否则你将无法意识到你正在做什么。</p>
<p>In the history of the universe, emerging races such as your own have so often fallen prey to foreign domination, have been absorbed by other races, cultures and political establishments. And some in many cases have simply been enslaved, like herds of animals. In the history of the universe, every possible error you can imagine has been committed countless times. Do not then become another statistic in this.</p>
<p>在宇宙的历史中，像你们这样的新兴种族常常沦为外来统治的牺牲品，被其他种族、文化和政治体制同化。在很多情况下，有些种族甚至像兽群一样被奴役。在宇宙的历史中，你们所能想到的所有错误都曾被无数次地犯过。因此，不要成为其中的又一个统计数字。</p>
<p>God wills that humanity become a free and united race in the Greater Community. But to achieve this, you must become united. You must become self-sufficient. And you must become extremely discerning and discreet regarding your relations and interactions with intelligent life in the universe. You must gain the wisdom and experience to tell friend from foe and to discern those who would use you for their own purposes.</p>
<p>上帝的意志是人类成为大社区中一个自由团结的种族。但要实现这一点，你们必须团结起来。你们必须自给自足。你们必须变得极其明辨和审慎，以应对你们与宇宙智能生命的关系和互动。你们必须获得智慧和经验，以区分敌友，并辨别那些为了他们自身目的而利用你们的种族。</p>
<p>God gives humanity what it needs, not what it expects or wants. You pray to God for little things, and God gives you the great thing. You do not know your predicament or your vulnerability. But God speaks to that. You do not know your true priorities in life. But God speaks to your true priorities.</p>
<p>上帝赐予人类所需的，而非其期望或欲望。你向上帝祈求小事，上帝却赐予你大事。你不知道你的困境或脆弱，但上帝会对此讲话。你不知道你在生命中真正优先考虑的内识，但上帝会对你真正优先考虑的内识进行讲话。</p>
<p>What people want and expect from God at this point do not represent the great needs of humanity. And it is to these great needs that God has given the New Message for the world—to prepare the world so that the world may have a future; to prepare humanity so that it may have a future; to nurture the growing evolution of human freedom and cooperation, which is still so fledgling here; to nurture this and to prepare it for the great challenges to come.</p>
<p>人们此刻对上帝的渴望和期待并不代表人类的伟大需求。正是针对这些伟大需求，上帝赋予了世界的新讯息——让世界进行准备，这样世界才能拥有一个未来；让人类进行准备，这样它才能拥有一个未来；滋养人类自由与合作的不断演进，它在这里依然如此羽翼未丰；滋养它，并为即将到来的伟大挑战进行准备。</p>
