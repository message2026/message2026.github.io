<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on September 10, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 9 月 10 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this critical time in human history when humanity is facing the Great Waves of change—environmental degradation, violent weather, the depletion of your essential resources, the loss of food production, growing economic and political instability and the threat of war—there is a foreign presence in the world. It has been here for some time. It is a presence from beyond the world, a presence that is here to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity.</p>
<p>在人类历史上的这个关键时刻，人类正面临着变革的巨浪——环境恶化、恶劣天气、重要资源的枯竭、粮食产量的减少、日益加剧的经济和政治不稳定以及战争的威胁——世界上出现了一种外来的存在。它在这里已经一段时间了。它来自世界之外，一种利用弱小和分裂的人类的存在。</p>
<p>To those people who become aware of it, and to those people whom it will capture for its own purposes, it will present itself as a benign and spiritual force. But in truth it represents an exploitive and dangerous presence.</p>
<p>对于那些察觉到它的存在，以及那些被它俘获以达到其目的的人来说，它会展现出一种仁慈的精神力量。但事实上，它代表着一种剥削性的、危险的存在。</p>
<p>These are physical beings from your local universe. They are resource explorers and economic collectives. They do not have military strength. Their power resides with their ability to influence the thinking of those whom they wish to persuade and to influence. In this, their presence, though small, has proven to be quite powerful and quite effective.</p>
<p>这些是来自你们本地宇宙的实体。他们是资源勘探者和经济集体。他们没有军事实力。他们的力量在于能够影响那些他们想要说服和影响的人的思维。在这方面，他们的存在虽然微不足道，但却被证明是相当强大和有效的。</p>
<p>The presence of this Intervention represents competition from beyond the world, competition for who will guide and influence humanity, and eventually who will rule humanity and who will humanity follow in the future.</p>
<p>这一干预的存在代表着来自世界之外的竞争，竞争谁将引导和影响人类，以及最终谁将统治人类以及人类未来将追随谁。</p>
<p>While people are preoccupied with their daily lives, and while nations are preoccupied with their economic difficulties and their contention and agreements with one another, the Intervention has been growing in the world. Though it represents a small force, it is having a growing influence. This is the power of persuasion that is used immensely and to great effect within the universe around you, within a Greater Community of intelligent life, of which humanity is but a very small part.</p>
<p>当人们专注于他们的日常生活，当各国专注于他们的经济困境以及他们彼此之间的争执和协议时，干预正在世界上不断增长。尽管它代表着一股微小的驱动力，但它正在产生日益增长的影响力。这就是说服的力量，它在你们周围的宇宙里，在一个智能生命大社区里被广泛地运用并产生巨大影响，而人类只是其中非常渺小的一部分。</p>
<p>Your notions of life in the universe, which have largely been shaped by your films and your media and your imagination, do not really account for how things work beyond the borders of your world and beyond the boundaries of this solar system. You live in a highly populated region of space where war and conflict have been suppressed, but where nations exert tremendous influence over each other, primarily through dependence upon trade.</p>
<p>你对宇宙生命的理解，很大程度上是由你们的电影、媒体和想象力塑造的，并不能真正解释你们世界边界之外、太阳系边界之外的生命是如何运作的。你们生活在一个人口稠密的太空区域，那里的战争和冲突被压制，但各国之间却彼此施加着极大的影响，主要通过对贸易的依赖。</p>
<p>You are emerging into a very complicated, but very mature set of circumstances. And your world is immensely rich and valuable—rich in biological resources, rich in its biological diversity. You are living on a planet of immense value to others, and you are ruining it, abusing it, mismanaging it.</p>
<p>你们正步入一个非常复杂但又非常成熟的环境。你们的世界极其富饶和宝贵——拥有丰富的生物资源，生物多样性极其丰富。你们生活在一个对其他人来说极其宝贵的星球上，而你们却在毁灭它、滥用它、管理不善。</p>
<p>Of course, this has brought the attention of others. Even more than the development of dangerous nuclear weapons, the degradation of the world’s environment by the human family is what has really called the Intervention here.</p>
<p>当然，这引起了其他种族的关注。比起危险的核武器的发展，人类大家庭对世界环境的破坏才是真正需要干预的。</p>
<p>This Intervention represents the most dangerous challenge to humanity’s freedom and self-determination that you have ever faced. While there has been visitation to your world throughout history, there has never been an Intervention such as this. And the forces who are here today do not represent those who visited your world in the distant past or in antiquity.</p>
<p>这一干预代表着你们人类自由和自决权所面临的最危险的挑战。尽管历史上一直有对你们世界的探访，但从未有过像这样的干预。今天在这里的势力并不代表那些在遥远的过去或远古时代访问过你们世界的势力。</p>
<p>Humanity is ignorant of life in the universe. You have not adapted to living within this Greater Community of life. You are unprepared for those who have already prepared for you. They have long studied your physiology, your psychology and your social behavior. They have prepared for you, but you are not prepared for them.</p>
<p>人类对宇宙中的生命一无所知。你们尚未适应生活在这个生命大社区里。你们尚未为那些已经为你们做好准备的种族做好准备。他们早已研究了你们的生理、心理和社会行为。他们为你们做好了准备，但你们却没有为他们做好准备。</p>
<p>Because there is no one on the Earth who could have a real knowledge and understanding of the complexities and the interactions of intelligent life in the universe, the preparation for this Greater Community must come from God. It must come from the Creator of all life. It has come through the Angelic Presence that watches over this world. It is a preparation unlike anything that has been given to humanity before, for you have never faced an Intervention such as you are facing now.</p>
<p>因为地球上没有人能够有一种真正的知识和理解宇宙智能生命的复杂性和互动，所以针对这个大社区的准备必须来自上帝。它必须来自所有生命的创造者。它通过护佑这个世界的天使存在而来。这是一个不同于以往任何赋予人类的准备，因为你们从未面对过像你们现在所面对的干预。</p>
<p>Your stories, your films and your fantasies about life in the universe have not prepared you for the reality of emerging into such a great, competitive environment. People still think that life in the universe is brutish, that nations in the universe are blowing each other up, or that there is one empire that rules everyone. But this is not the case at all.</p>
<p>你们的故事、电影以及关于宇宙生命的幻想，并没有让你们做好面对如此宏大、竞争如此激烈的现实的准备。人们仍然认为宇宙生命是野蛮的，认为宇宙中的国家正在互相毁灭，或者认为存在一个统治所有种族的帝国。但事实并非如此。</p>
<p>Indeed, humanity now needs to prepare for its future in the Greater Community of life. It needs to end its ceaseless conflicts, which only weaken you and divide you in the face of competition from beyond the world.</p>
<p>事实上，人类现在需要为它在生命大社区中的未来进行准备。它需要结束它无休止的冲突，这些冲突只会削弱你们，并在面对来自世界外的竞争时分裂你们。</p>
<p>Humanity is facing its greatest threat and greatest challenge, but it is also facing its greatest opportunity to forge human unity and cooperation for the preservation of the world. You will need this unity and cooperation to face and to survive the Great Waves of change that are coming, which are largely the result of humanity’s overuse and misuse of the world. You will need this unity and cooperation to face the reality of life in the universe and the reality that humanity is now facing an Intervention in the world that is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>人类正面临其最重大的威胁和挑战，但它也正面临其最伟大的机遇，即为了维护世界而构建人类团结与合作。你们需要这种团结与合作来面对并生存下来，即将到来的变革巨浪，这很大程度上是人类过度使用和滥用世界的结果。你们需要这种团结与合作来面对宇宙生命的现实，以及人类现在正面临一种极其危险的世界干预的现实。</p>
<p>This is not a visitation. It is an Intervention whose purpose is to gain control of the world and the world’s peoples. These forces cannot live within your world. They cannot breathe your atmosphere. And so they need human labor and human cooperation to serve their purposes here—to mine the world for its biological resources and to use the world for its strategic importance.</p>
<p>这不是一次探访。这是一次干预，其目的是控制世界和世界民众。这些势力无法在你们的世界里生存。他们无法呼吸你们的大气。因此他们需要人类的劳动和人类的合作来服务于他们在此的目的——开采这个世界的生物资源，并利用这个世界实现其战略重要性。</p>
<p>You may perhaps wonder what has been flying in your skies for the last many decades. And if you are aware of it at all, you may wonder why there have been sightings all over your world for many decades. If you have taken the time to look into this carefully and objectively, you must come to the conclusion that a visitation is underway, and that it is secret in nature. It is being carried out surreptitiously, its intentions and activities hidden from public awareness. Even governments hide from their populations what little they know about the foreign presence, the extraterrestrial presence that is in the world today.</p>
<p>你或许会好奇，过去几十年来，究竟是什么在你们的天空中翱翔。如果你对此有所察觉，你或许会疑惑，为什么几十年来，你们的世界各地都曾出现目击事件。如果你花时间仔细客观地探究此事，你必然会得出这样的结论：一场造访正在进行，而且是秘密进行的。它正在秘密进行，其意图和活动不为公众所知。就连各国政府也对其民众隐瞒了他们所知甚少的关于当今世界存在的外星存在——外星生命的存在——的信息。</p>
<p>There is no one in the world who can prepare you for the realities of life in the universe, and that is why there is a New Message from God in the world. Its purpose is to prepare humanity for the Great Waves of change that are coming, to prepare humanity for its encounter with life in the universe, and to prepare humanity to recognize its greater spiritual power that has the strength to unite humanity and to provide humanity a greater future, a future that will be unlike the past.</p>
<p>世界上没有人能够让你为宇宙生命的现实进行准备，正因如此，世界上才有一条来自上帝的新讯息。它的宗旨是让人类为即将到来的变革巨浪进行准备，让人类为它与宇宙生命的相遇进行准备，让人类为认知它更伟大的精神力量进行准备，这力量拥有团结人类的力量，并为人类提供一个更伟大的未来，一个不同于过去的未来。</p>
<p>But to see the blessing here, you must recognize the need. To see the importance of this preparation, you must recognize the great need for it.</p>
<p>但要看到这里的祝福，你必须认出它的需求。要看到这个准备的重要性，你必须认识到它的伟大需求。</p>
<p>This is not merely an issue for governments. It is really a primary issue for each citizen of the world, for the Intervention is here to cast persuasion over the world, to gain control of the minds and hearts of people. It is doing this by offering people incredible promises of salvation and free energy, promising humanity peace and equanimity, offering advanced technology in order for humanity to become dependent on these foreign powers.</p>
<p>这不仅仅是政府的问题。它实际上是每个世界公民面临的一个首要问题，因为干预在此是为了向世界施压，为了控制人们的心灵和内心。它通过向人们提供令人难以置信的救赎和自由能源的承诺，承诺人类和平与安宁，提供先进科技，以便人类能够依赖这些外来大国。</p>
<p>And like the foolish natives of so many tribes before, humanity is acquiescing to these promises. Having lost faith in human leadership and human institutions, many people are now turning to the Intervention for guidance, believing its promises of peace and technology.</p>
<p>就像过去许多部落的愚蠢原住民一样，人类默许了这些承诺。许多人对人类领导力和人类机构失去了信心，如今转向干预寻求指引，相信其和平与科技的承诺。</p>
<p>As a result, today in the world the Intervention, amongst the very few people who are even aware of it, has many representatives and few critics. It is because the Intervention has studied human psychology and physiology and has devised a very potent form of persuasion. It has taken many people against their will and subjected them to cruel experiments and powerful forms of mind control.</p>
<p>因此，在当今世界上，干预在极少数甚至察觉到它的人中，拥有众多代表和极少批评者。这是因为干预研究了人类心理学和生理学，并设计出了一种非常有效的说服形式。它违背了许多人的心意，将他们置于残酷的实验和强大的心灵控制之下。</p>
<p>Many of these people now cannot think for themselves. Their minds have been overtaken. Their freedom has been taken from them. They are now like laboratory animals for the Intervention, used for reproductive purposes so the Intervention can create hybrid individuals to be in positions of power and influence in government, commerce and religion.</p>
<p>这些人中的许多人如今已无法独立思考。他们的心灵已被掌控。他们的自由已被剥夺。他们如今就像干预的实验动物，被用作生殖目的，以便干预能够创造出混血个体，让他们占据政府、商业和宗教领域的权力和影响力。</p>
<p>Though this Intervention represents a small force and still has had limited impact in the world, its impact is growing. As humanity faces greater and greater instability and faces the temptation of conflict and war, this Intervention will gain in strength. Its promises of peace and power will become ever more seductive.</p>
<p>尽管这一干预代表着一股微小的势力，并且对世界的影响力依然有限，但它的影响力正在增长。随着人类面临越来越大的不稳定，面临冲突和战争的诱惑，这一干预将增强力量。它对和平与力量的承诺将变得越来越诱人。</p>
<p>It will take many more people against their will, turning them against the human family, turning them against the Knowledge that God has placed within them, turning them against themselves. While humanity is fighting and struggling down here on Earth, other forces are here to take advantage of its predicaments, its ignorance and its superstitions.</p>
<p>它将迫使更多人违背他们的意愿，让他们对抗人类大家庭，让他们对抗上帝置于他们内在的内识，让他们对抗他们自己。当人类在地球上战斗和挣扎时，其他势力正在这里利用它的困境、它的无知和它的迷信。</p>
<p>There are many people, even very educated people, who think that any visitation to the world would be peaceful and that those who are visiting would offer humanity wisdom and scientific knowledge. The naiveté of this approach is clearly obvious, but the tragedy is that this is the attitude of many people.</p>
<p>很多人，甚至是受过良好教育的人，都认为任何造访地球的行为都是和平的，并且造访者会为人类带来智慧和科学知识。这种想法的天真显而易见，但悲剧的是，许多人都抱有这种态度。</p>
<p>Your scientific community thinks that foreign powers will come to share their scientific knowledge. The expectation is that the visitation will bear gifts, needed gifts, and of course these expectations are now being taken advantage of.</p>
<p>你们的科学界认为，外来势力会来分享他们的科学知识。人们的期望是，来访者会带来礼物，那些需要的礼物，当然，这些期望现在被利用了。</p>
<p>As resources decline within this world, and as economic and political instability increases, the offerings of the Intervention will become ever more persuasive. Yet what it is offering is your own demise—the loss of human freedom, your dependence upon foreign technology and foreign powers.</p>
<p>随着这个世界的资源衰退，随着经济和政治不稳定性的加剧，干预的诱惑将变得越来越有说服力。然而它提供的是你们自身的毁灭——人类自由的丧失，你们对外来科技和外来势力的依赖。</p>
<p>This is how races such as yours, who are unprepared for life in the universe, can fall under foreign persuasion and foreign dominance. This is how a world such as this could be overtaken without any use of force.</p>
<p>正是如此，像你们这样对宇宙生命毫无准备的种族，才会遭受外来势力的劝诱和统治。正是如此，这样的世界才有可能不费一丝武力就被征服。</p>
<p>If you think of your recent history—how great nations and empires were overtaken by small exploratory forces, how the Aztecs and the Incas were conquered by small expeditionary forces who exploited their weakness and their ignorance and their superstitions—this is how a small but clever force can gain advantage against a much greater opponent.</p>
<p>如果你回想一下近代历史——强大的国家和帝国是如何被小规模的探索势力所征服的，阿兹特克人和印加人是如何被小规模的远征军所征服的，这些远征军利用了他们的弱点、无知和迷信——这就是一支虽小但狡猾的势力如何能够战胜更强大的对手。</p>
<p>Humanity is foolish. It is not prepared. It does not recognize its vulnerability. As the human family is now squandering its natural inheritance, it is also depriving its future citizens and generations of self-sufficiency. Without self-sufficiency, you would not be able to deny the offerings of the Intervention, or any future intervention that may take place here.</p>
<p>人类是愚蠢的。它没有做好准备。它没有认知它的脆弱性。当人类大家庭正在挥霍它的自然遗产时，它也在剥夺它的未来公民和世世代代的自给自足。如果没有自给自足，你们就无法拒绝干预的奉献，或任何未来可能在此发生的干预。</p>
<p>People naturally ask: “Well, how can this be resisted? Do we have any hope against such a presence and a power?” The answer is yes, of course you do. Humanity has a great advantage, for outright invasion is not allowed in this region of space because it is a very civilized part of the universe. Races cannot come and take another world by force. It is not allowed because it represents danger and instability in this part of space.</p>
<p>人们自然会问：“那么，这该如何抵抗？我们对这样的存在和大国还有希望吗？”答案是肯定的，当然有。人类拥有巨大的优势，因为在这个太空区域，直接入侵是不被允许的，因为它是宇宙中一个非常文明的部分。种族无法强行入侵另一个世界。这不被允许，因为它在这片太空区域代表着危险和不稳定。</p>
<p>If races want to gain influence in another world, it must appear that their presence is accepted and welcomed. They must attempt to gain control by other means.</p>
<p>如果一个种族想要在另一个世界获得影响力，就必须表现出他们的存在被接受和欢迎。他们必须尝试通过其他方式获得控制权。</p>
<p>Of course, there is no way that humanity could ever understand this on its own, having no awareness of the rules of engagement that exist in this region of space. Your lack of education here is putting you at a great disadvantage and making you extremely vulnerable to the kinds of persuasions that are being cast upon the human family at this time.</p>
<p>当然，人类根本不可能独自理解这一点，因为他们不理解存在于这个太空领域的交战规则。你们在此缺乏教育，这让你们处于巨大劣势，并让你们极度容易受到此刻正被施加于人类家庭的各种劝说的影响。</p>
<p>Humanity has a great advantage. If it refuses the offerings and the persuasions of the Intervention, the Intervention must withdraw. If the presence of the Intervention becomes known to enough people, it can no longer function in secrecy and must withdraw. If your mind and heart cannot be turned through persuasion and seduction or intimidation, then the Intervention has no power over you.</p>
<p>人类拥有一个巨大优势。如果它拒绝干预的奉献和劝说，干预就必须撤退。如果干预的存在被足够多的人知晓，它就无法再秘密运作，必须撤出。如果你的心灵和内心无法通过说服、诱惑或恐吓被转变，那么干预就无法掌控你。</p>
<p>What is necessary for you to understand here is that God has placed a deeper Intelligence within you, an Intelligence that is very unlike your intellect. It is powerful. It is strong. It cannot be corrupted. It cannot be persuaded. It cannot be overtaken by any power, whether it be human or extraterrestrial. It represents the core of your strength, the essence of your integrity and the source of your wisdom.</p>
<p>在这里，你需要理解的是，上帝在你内在放置了一个更深层次的智能，一个与你的智力截然不同的智能。它是强大的。它是有实力的。它无法被腐化。它无法被说服。它无法被任何力量超越，无论是人类还是外星力量。它代表着你力量的核心，你完整性的本质，以及你智慧的源泉。</p>
<p>God has given each person Knowledge to guide them, to protect them and to lead them to a greater life in the world. But there are very few people in the world today who are aware of the power and the presence of Knowledge.</p>
<p>上帝赋予每个人内识，来指引他们、保护他们，并引领他们走向更伟大的生命。但当今世界，只有极少数人察觉到内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>In the universe, the power and the presence of Knowledge is the greatest power there is—greater than technology, greater than ideology, greater than persuasion. The Intervention is not using this Knowledge and is not aware of it, or it would not be intervening in the world.</p>
<p>在宇宙中，内识的力量和存在是最伟大的力量——超越科技，超越意识形态，超越说服。干预没有运用这个内识，也没有察觉到它，否则它就不会干预世界。</p>
<p>For Knowledge represents a fundamental ethical foundation. You cannot attack or exploit another, guided by Knowledge. And those who are guided by Knowledge cannot be exploited, cannot be fooled, cannot be seduced.</p>
<p>因为内识代表着根本的伦理基础。在内识的指引下，你无法攻击或剥削他人。而那些受内识指引的人不会被剥削，不会被愚弄，不会被诱惑。</p>
<p>Humanity has kept alive its spiritual traditions. You do not realize how valuable this is, for in your neighborhood of space, there are large technological societies that are entirely secular in nature.</p>
<p>人类一直传承着它的精神传统。你没有意识到这有多么宝贵，因为在你们的太空邻居中，存在着本质上完全世俗的大型科技社会。</p>
<p>Spiritual enlightenment is extremely rare in the universe, as it is in your world. Freedom is rare in the universe, as it is in your world. Free races remain hidden and do not become involved in vast networks of trade and the controlling forces that govern them.</p>
<p>精神启蒙在宇宙中极其罕见，就像在你们的世界中一样。自由在宇宙中也极其罕见，就像在你们的世界一样。自由种族保持隐匿，不被卷入庞大的贸易网络​​及其控制力量。</p>
<p>There is so much for you to learn about life in the universe, and your education is only now beginning. This education is vitally necessary, for your isolation in space is over. From this point forward, there will be constant attempts to persuade humanity, constant interventions. That is why the human family must establish its own rules of engagement and assert its will and determination to be a free people in the universe.</p>
<p>关于宇宙生命，你们还有太多东西需要学习，而你们的教育才刚刚开始。这种教育至关重要，因为你们在太空中的隔离已经结束。从此刻起，将会有持续不断的尝试去说服人类，持续不断的干预。正因如此，人类大家庭必须建立它自身的参与规则，并坚持人类在宇宙中成为自由民族的意志和决心。</p>
<p>At present, you are transmitting all of your foolishness into space, all of your secrets into space, for the discreet observer to watch. You are telling the universe about your strengths and, even more importantly, about your weaknesses. You are inviting Intervention through your reckless use of the world and your endless conflicts and issues between nations and peoples. The Intervention has only to wait while humanity weakens itself through competition and conflict. You are doing the work of the Intervention in this regard.</p>
<p>此刻，你们正在把你们所有的愚蠢、你们所有的秘密传送到太空，供谨慎的观察者观看。你们正在向宇宙讲述你们的优势，更重要的是，讲述你们的弱点。你们正在通过你们对世界的鲁莽使用以及你们在国家和民众之间无休止的冲突和问题，邀请干预。干预只需等待，直到人类通过竞争和冲突削弱它自身。在这方面，你们正在进行干预的工作。</p>
<p>There is a growing hopelessness in the world. People are losing faith, if they ever even had faith in themselves and one another. It is within this environment of difficulty and hopelessness that foreign powers can gain their great advantage here.</p>
<p>世界上的绝望情绪日益加剧。人们正在失去信心，即便他们曾经对他们自己和他人抱有信心。正是在这种充满困难和绝望的环境中，外来势力才能在这里获得巨大的优势。</p>
<p>Never think that foreign governance of this world would be desirable in any way, for you have no idea of the cruelty and the harshness that such governance would bring to the human family. The value of humanity, its divinity, its accomplishments, are of no importance to the Intervention. You are merely a resource to them. They view you the way you view your domesticated animals. They think you are brutish and violent and chaotic. They have no awareness of your spiritual nature. Nor do they value your great traditions. Being without Knowledge themselves, they do not see it in you.</p>
<p>永远不要认为外来势力对这个世界的治理会以任何方式令人向往，因为你们根本不知道这种治理会给人类大家庭带来多么残酷和严酷。人类的价值，它的神性，它的成就，对干预来说毫无意义。你们对他们来说仅仅是一个资源。他们看待你们就像你们看待你们的家畜一样。他们认为你们野蛮、暴力、混乱。他们没有觉知你们的精神自然。他们也不会珍视你们的伟大传统。由于他们自己没有内识，他们在你们身上也看不到它。</p>
<p>They represent the reality of so many races in the universe who are ruthlessly engaged in the acquisition of resources. Having stripped their own home worlds of their natural wealth, they must now travel and become involved in complex arrangements of trade to gain what they need.</p>
<p>它们代表了宇宙中众多种族残酷地攫取资源的现实。他们掠夺了母星的自然资源，如今必须远行，参与复杂的贸易安排才能获得所需的资源。</p>
<p>Humanity is following a path that many nations have always followed—depleting their home worlds and then becoming prone to seduction by forces in the Greater Community. For once you enter these great networks of trade, your destiny will be determined by others. You will have to meet whatever terms and conditions are required for you to receive what you need—whether it be food and medicine or advanced technology. You will have very little freedom and self-determination under these circumstances. This has been the fate of so many races.</p>
<p>人类正在走一条许多国家一直以来都在走的道路——耗尽他们的家园，然后变得容易受到大社区势力的诱惑。因为一旦你们进入这些庞大的贸易网络​​，你们的命运将由他人决定。你们必须满足任何必要的条款和条件才能获得你们所需的东西——无论是食物、药品还是先进科技。在这种情况下，你们将几乎没有自由和自主权。这一直是许多种族的命运。</p>
<p>Now you are vulnerable. Like the adolescent child in the big city, you are entering a larger arena of life—unprepared, without wisdom and discernment regarding all the forces that could take advantage of you in your innocence and your ignorance.</p>
<p>现在你们很脆弱。就像大城市里的青春期孩子一样，你们正在步入一个更广阔的生命舞台——毫无准备，缺乏智慧和辨别力，无法应对所有可能利用你们的天真和无知的势力。</p>
<p>Here humanity must grow up and become mature. Here war and conflict must be set aside, for you cannot afford them now. Human unity is essential if humanity is to remain free in the universe. Human unity is essential if humanity is to overcome the Great Waves of change and to create a greater stability and security in the world.</p>
<p>在这里，人类必须成长并走向成熟。在这里，战争和冲突必须被搁置，因为你们现在承受不起它们。如果人类要在宇宙中保持自由，人类团结至关重要。如果人类要克服变革的巨浪，并在世界上创造更伟大的稳定和安全，人类团结至关重要。</p>
<p>You now face competition from beyond the world. It is without military force, but its powers of persuasion are powerful and effective. But the stronger you are with Knowledge, the more you will be free from this persuasion, and the more you will be able to see through the deception to recognize the real nature and intent of this presence in the world.</p>
<p>你们现在面对着来自世界之外的竞争。它没有军事力量，但它的说服力强大而有效。但是你们的内识越强大，你们就越能摆脱这种说服，你就越能看透欺骗，认出这个存在于世界上的实际本质和意图。</p>
<p>The New Message from God calls this presence “the Great Darkness.” Those who are intervening in your world are not demons or devils, but their intention here is very dangerous for humanity, and that is why their presence here is called the Great Darkness.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息将这个存在称为“巨大的黑暗”。那些干预你们世界的存在并非恶魔或魔鬼，但他们在此的意图对人类非常危险，正因如此，他们在此的存在被称为巨大的黑暗。</p>
<p>It is time for humanity to end its ceaseless conflicts and to prepare for its future and destiny within a Greater Community of intelligent life in the universe. God has sent a New Message into the world to warn humanity, to strengthen humanity and to prepare humanity for this great encounter with life—an encounter that will determine the fate and the destiny of humanity.</p>
<p>现在是人类结束其无休止冲突，并为它在宇宙智能生命大社区内的未来和天命进行准备的时候了。上帝向世界发来了一条新讯息，以警示人类，强化人类，并让人类为与生命的这一伟大相遇进行准备——这个相遇将决定人类的命运和天命。</p>
<p>There is no other problem or challenge that is greater than this. For what could you accomplish or achieve or preserve in the world if the world fell under foreign domination? What advantage could you create for yourself or what national objective could you strive for if the world fell under foreign domination?</p>
<p>没有什么问题或挑战比这更严峻。如果世界落入外来统治，你能成就什么、取得什么成就、维护什么？如果世界落入外来统治，你能为你自己创造什么优势，你能为国家目标奋斗什么？</p>
<p>Never think that such domination cannot occur. You do not realize the power of persuasion in the mental environment.</p>
<p>千万不要认为这种统治不会发生。你还没有意识到在心理环境中，说服的力量有多大。</p>
<p>The Intervention can control the minds and hearts of people, but it cannot have any influence over those who are strong with Knowledge. And for any individuals who have been captured or taken against their will by the Intervention, they can reclaim their strength and their self-determination by gaining access to Knowledge and taking the Steps to Knowledge.</p>
<p>干预能够控制人们的心灵和内心，但它无法对那些拥有强大内识的人产生任何影响。对于任何被干预捕获或违背其意愿带走的个体，他们可以通过获取内识并开展内识进阶来重拾他们的力量和他们的自决权。</p>
<p>As they become stronger with Knowledge, they will cease to be compliant subjects for the Intervention to use. They will become a hazard to the Intervention and will be avoided by it.</p>
<p>随着他们的内识变得更加强大，他们将不再是干预所利用的顺从对象。他们将成为干预的危险，并被干预所回避。</p>
<p>You may feel helpless. You may think that a foreign power with foreign technology would have a strength that would be insurmountable, but you are dealing with small groups of resource explorers who are posing as great technological powers.</p>
<p>你可能会感到无助。你或许认为，一个拥有外星科技的外星强国拥有着不可战胜的力量，但你们面对的却是一小群冒充科技强国的资源勘探者。</p>
<p>Humanity has the great advantage. If humanity becomes wise and alerted to the presence of the Intervention, it cannot be turned. It will resist the Intervention. You will recognize the danger and you will respond appropriately. You will not be fooled by promises of wealth, power or spiritual fulfillment. Your native awareness and skills of discernment will tell you that this is nothing but an intervention.</p>
<p>人类拥有巨大优势。如果人类变得明智，并警觉到干预的存在，它就无法被转变。它将抵制干预。你们将认出危险，并将做出恰当的回应。你们不会被财富、权力或精神满足的承诺愚弄。你们天生的觉知和辨识技能将告诉你们，这只不过是一次干预。</p>
<p>You will learn the lessons from history, the lessons of intervention—that those who are intervening are always here for self-interest and that the native peoples, should they fall under foreign persuasion, will suffer greatly, and their world and civilization will fall under foreign domination. This is what history and nature have taught you regarding competition and intervention.</p>
<p>你们将从历史中汲取教训，汲取干预的教训——干预者始终是为了自身利益，而原住民一旦受到外来势力的蛊惑，将遭受巨大苦难，他们的世界和文明也将沦为外来统治。这就是历史和自然教给你们的关于竞争和干预的教诲。</p>
<p>You are the native peoples of the world facing intervention. How will you respond? Will you ignore it or deny it? Will you see it according to your wishes and your preferences or according to your religious understanding, thinking that humanity is the center of the universe and that everyone and everything revolves around you? This is the attitude and assumption of so many people. But you can see its foolishness.</p>
<p>你是这个世界上面临干预的原住民。你将如何回应？你会忽略它还是否认它？你会按照你的愿望和偏好来看待它，还是按照你的宗教理解来看待它，认为人类是宇宙的中心，所有人和所有事物都围绕着你们旋转？这是许多人的态度和假设。但你能够看到它的愚蠢。</p>
<p>If you are to maintain your stewardship of this world, you must protect it against foreign intervention. You must preserve and husband its valuable resources. And you must unite and end your ceaseless conflicts.</p>
<p>如果你们要维护对这个世界的管理，就必须保护它免受外来干涉。必须保护并节约它的宝贵资源。必须团结起来，结束你们之间无休止的冲突。</p>
<p>A weak and divided humanity will have no power in the universe and will be subject to endless intervention and manipulation. This is a truth that your nations and your peoples must come to see.</p>
<p>一个软弱分裂的人类，在宇宙中将毫无力量，并将遭受无休止的干预和操控。这是你们的国家和人民必须看到的真理。</p>
<p>It is part of the warning in the message of God’s New Revelation, a Revelation that is here not to compete with humanity’s religious traditions but to enlighten them, to expand them and to educate them, to give them a greater future as humanity faces the reality and the difficulty of encountering life in the universe.</p>
<p>它是上帝新启示讯息中警示的一部分，这个启示在此不是为了与人类的宗教传统竞争，而是为了启迪它们、拓展它们、教育它们，在人类面对现实以及遭遇宇宙生命之艰难时，赋予它们一个更伟大的未来。</p>
<p>You must resist the Intervention. You must recognize it is nothing more than competition from beyond the world. You must not be fooled by its promises of wealth and power and freedom. You must not become dejected or resign yourself, thinking that you have no power in this matter, for humanity has the great advantage. Exert your will that you will not be dominated or persuaded, and the Intervention has no power here. It must withdraw and seek to gain advantage here through other means.</p>
<p>你必须抵制干预。你必须认识到它只不过是来自世界之外的竞争。你绝不能被它对财富、权力和自由的承诺所愚弄。你绝不能变得沮丧或听天由命，认为你在这件事上没有力量，因为人类拥有巨大优势。运用你的意志，这样你就不会被支配或说服，干预在这里没有力量。它必须撤出，并寻求通过其他方式在此获得优势。</p>
<p>Do not accept foreign technology, for it is only here to addict you and to persuade you and to make you dependent. It is a seduction, and nothing more. It is like giving drugs to a native tribe in the jungle, who then become addicted and enslaved to whoever provides these things.</p>
<p>不要接受外星技术，因为它的存在只是为了让你们上瘾、说服你们、让你们依赖。它只是一种诱惑，仅此而已。它就像给丛林里的土著部落提供毒品，让他们上瘾，并成为提供这些毒品的人的奴隶。</p>
<p>Your love of technology places you in a position of vulnerability, vulnerability to those who are more technologically advanced than you. They will bring you trinkets from space, and you will think it is marvelous, and you will want them for yourself.</p>
<p>你们对科技的热爱让你们处于一种脆弱的境地，容易受到那些科技比你们更先进的种族的攻击。他们会给你们带来来自太空的小玩意儿，你们会觉得它们很奇妙，想要据为己有。</p>
<p>This is how the native peoples are seduced and persuaded. They are intimidated. They are dazzled by technology. Their conflicts are taken advantage of. Their leadership is undermined. This is how an Intervention gains strength amongst the native peoples. This has happened throughout human history. And this happens throughout the Greater Community as well.</p>
<p>这就是原住民被引诱和说服的方式。他们被恐吓。他们被科技迷惑。他们的冲突被利用。他们的领导力被削弱。这就是干预在原住民中获得力量的方式。这在整个人类历史中发生过。这也在整个大社区中发生过。</p>
<p>No one is going to come and destroy the world or eradicate life because life is the value here. It is the resources of life. Humanity is extremely valuable to the Intervention, as a workforce. It will corral you and subjugate you if it can gain that much control here, but it does rely upon you.</p>
<p>没有人会来毁灭世界或消灭生命，因为生命是这里的价值所在。它是生命的资源。人类作为一支劳动力，对干预来说极其宝贵。如果它能在这里获得如此多的控制权，它将圈养你们、征服你们，但它确实依赖你们。</p>
<p>You may feel you are predominant and preeminent within this world, but in the Greater Community, you are like an adolescent. You are without skill, without wisdom and without preparation.</p>
<p>你或许觉得你们在这个世界中居于主导地位、卓越不凡，但在大社区里，你们就像一个青少年。你们缺乏技能，缺乏智慧，缺乏准备。</p>
<p>It is gaining this wisdom, wisdom from the Greater Community; it is gaining skill in the mental environment; and it is developing a foundation of Knowledge within yourself as an individual that will prepare you more than anything else for the reality and the challenge of the Greater Community.</p>
<p>它正在获得这种智慧，来自大社区的智慧；它正在获得心理环境中的技能；它正在你作为一个个体内在发展一个内识基础，这将比任何其他事情都更能帮助你为大社区的现实和挑战做好准备。</p>
<p>Humanity has never had such a challenge. It has never faced competition from beyond the world. This competition is occurring now because humanity has created an infrastructure that other races can use—worldwide commerce and communication.</p>
<p>人类从未面临过这样的挑战。它从未面临过来自世界之外的竞争。这场竞争现在正在发生，因为人类创造了一个其他种族能够使用的基础设施——全球商业和通讯。</p>
<p>Humanity is also developing dangerous powers. Should it become more powerful militarily, then Intervention here would become more difficult in the future.</p>
<p>人类也在发展危险的力量。如果军事实力进一步增强，未来对人类的干预将更加困难。</p>
<p>If humanity should really become educated about the realities and challenges of life in the universe, then Intervention such as occurring today would not be possible. You would be too aware and too strong for such an Intervention to be successful here.</p>
<p>如果人类真的了解了宇宙生命的现实和挑战，那么像今天这样的干预就不可能发生。你们太过警觉，太过强大，以至于这样的干预无法在这里成功。</p>
<p>There are many people in the world today who have a natural connection to life in the universe. They have come into this world at this time because humanity is facing its early contact with the Greater Community.</p>
<p>当今世界上有许多人与宇宙生命有着天然的联结。他们来到这个世界，是因为人类正面临与大社区的早期接触。</p>
<p>It is no accident you are here at this time. God has sent you into the world at this time to help prepare humanity for its emergence into a Greater Community of intelligent life. But this emergence must be carried out with wisdom and discernment, strength and determination.</p>
<p>你此时此刻来到这里并非偶然。上帝此时派遣你来到这个世界，是为了帮助人类做好迈向智能生命大社区的准备。但这个迈进必须以智慧和辨别力、实力和决心来实现。</p>
<p>This is no casual matter. It is the greatest threshold that humanity will ever face. You will either gain strength and unity or lose your freedom in such an emergence.</p>
<p>这不是一件无关紧要的事。它是人类有史以来面临的最大门槛。在这样的危机中，你们要么获得实力与团结，要么失去自由。</p>
<p>Be careful here not to think that there are powerful and positive foreign races in the world today. Many people make this mistake because they still want to be saved or rescued. They want contact. They do not realize that humanity’s real Allies are not present in the world. They are not here influencing humanity, controlling and manipulating human perception, human emotion and human allegiance.</p>
<p>在这里，要小心，不要认为当今世界存在着强大而积极的外来种族。许多人犯下这种错误，是因为他们仍然渴望被拯救或解救。他们渴望接触。他们没有意识到，人类真正的盟友并不存在于这个世界。他们并没有在这里影响人类，控制和操纵人类的感知、情感和忠诚。</p>
<p>Your Allies would not intervene in the world in such a manner, for this would require them to take control of the world, which they will not do. And this would undermine humanity’s potential to become a free and self-determined race in the universe.</p>
<p>你们的盟友不会以这种方式干预世界，因为这将要求他们掌控世界，而他们不会这样做。这将损害人类成为宇宙中一个自由、自主种族的潜力。</p>
<p>Your real Allies have sent a set of Briefings into the world to help prepare humanity for the realities of life in the universe and to warn humanity against the Intervention that is occurring in the world today. That is their gift to humanity.</p>
<p>你们真正的盟友向世界发送了一系列简报，帮助人类为宇宙生命的现实做好准备，并警告人类警惕当今世界正在发生的干预。这是他们给予人类的礼物。</p>
<p>Do not think that another race will come and rescue you. Do not think of yourself as being so weak and powerless that you would need such a rescue. For any race that would promise this would really be here to take advantage of your weakness and your vulnerability.</p>
<p>不要指望其他种族会来拯救你们。不要认为你自己软弱无力，需要这样的救援。任何承诺这样做的种族，其实都是想利用你们的软弱和脆弱。</p>
<p>This is the wisdom and clarity you must bring to this situation. It is not about love or fear. It is about clarity, certainty and responsibility. Love or fear is what people project because they are too weak to become directly engaged. It is a fool’s discernment. You must bring strength and clarity here. You must become prepared for the Greater Community. And you must resist the Intervention. Speak out against it.</p>
<p>这就是你在这种情况下必须具备的智慧和清醒。这与爱或恐惧无关。它关乎清晰、确定性和责任。爱或恐惧是人们的投射，因为他们太过软弱，无法直接参与其中。这是一种愚昧的辨别。你必须在此带来力量和清晰。你必须为大社区做好准备。你必须抵制干预。大声反对它。</p>
<p>Receive the gift of Wisdom from your true Allies, who do not seek domination here, who are not intervening in the world for their own purposes. They have given humanity the gift of Wisdom, which is the greatest gift that any foreign race can give to a struggling humanity.</p>
<p>从你们真正的盟友那里接收智慧的礼物，他们不谋求统治，不为一己私利干涉世界。他们给予了人类智慧的礼物，这是任何外来种族能够给予挣扎中的人类的最伟大的礼物。</p>
<p>Intervention leads to subjugation. What is occurring in the world today is teaching you this. When a great, larger power intervenes in another nation, it has to control that nation. And it ends up harming that nation, even if its motives seem noble and valuable.</p>
<p>干预导致征服。当今世界正在发生的事情正在教你们这一点。当一个强大的国家干预另一个国家时，它必须控制这个国家。最终，它会伤害这个国家，即使它的动机看似高尚且具有价值。</p>
<p>Intervention is always carried out for self-interest. History has taught you this. Nature teaches you this. Life teaches you this.</p>
<p>干预总是出于自身利益。历史教会了你这一点。大自然教会了你这一点。生命也教会了你这一点。</p>
<p>You resist the Intervention because you become strong with Knowledge. You resist the Intervention when you become educated about the realities of life in the universe.</p>
<p>你抵制干预，因为你的内识变得强大。你抵制干预，是因为当你了解了宇宙生命的现实。</p>
<p>You resist the Intervention when you remember that you cannot and should not accept gifts from strangers who will not reveal their real purpose to you. As you would not allow strangers to enter your home, you should not allow strangers to enter your world.</p>
<p>当你牢记你不能也不应该接受陌生人的礼物，而这些礼物不愿向你透露其真实目的时，你就在抵制干预。正如你不会允许陌生人进入你的家一样，你也不应该允许陌生人进入你们的世界。</p>
<p>If you were really well versed in the realities of life in the universe, you would resist Intervention with all of your might. And Intervention would be driven off, its veil of secrecy removed, its real intentions exposed. Unable to turn and to seduce an aware humanity, it would have to retreat.</p>
<p>如果你真的深谙宇宙生命的现实，你就会竭尽全力抵抗干预。干预将被驱逐，其神秘面纱将被揭开，其真实意图将被暴露。由于无法转变并诱惑醒来的人类，干预将不得不撤退。</p>
<p>It is this awareness and this education and this inner certainty that you as an individual must bring to this situation.</p>
<p>作为个体，你必须将这种觉知、这种教育和这种内在的确定性带到这种情况中。</p>
<p>Do not think that you are powerless in the face of the Intervention, for that represents the Intervention’s persuasion and exploitation of your lack of self-confidence.</p>
<p>不要认为你们在干预面前无能为力，因为这代表着干预的说服和对你缺乏自信的利用。</p>
<p>Do not think the Intervention is going to save humanity, for then you are falling under the seduction of the Intervention—a seduction that will rob you of everything that is valuable in your life.</p>
<p>不要认为干预将拯救人类，因为这样你就陷入了干预的诱惑——这个诱惑将夺走你生命中一切宝贵的东西。</p>
<p>God has sent a New Message into the world to warn humanity and to prepare humanity. It is this preparation that is essential. It will restore to you the power and the presence of Knowledge. It will educate you about the realities of life in the universe. And it will help prepare the human family to fulfill its destiny of becoming a free race in the universe.</p>
<p>上帝向世界发来了一条新讯息，以警示人类并让人类进行准备。正是这个准备至关重要。它将恢复你内识的力量和存在。它将教育你关于宇宙生命的现实。它将帮助人类大家庭进行准备，去实现它成为宇宙中一个自由种族的天命。</p>
<p>All of God’s Messages that have been sent into the world over time have been to strengthen humanity and to foster freedom to build human civilization. Though every religion has been started by God, they have all been changed by people, even to the point that their initial intent has been lost. But, in essence, God has initiated all the world’s religions to enable human civilization to grow and become stronger.</p>
<p>上帝一直以来传达给世人的所有讯息，都是为了强化人类，促进自由，从而建立人类文明。虽然所有宗教都由上帝创立，但它们都被人改变了，甚至失去了最初的意图。但本质上，上帝创立了世界上所有的宗教，都是为了使人类文明得以发展壮大。</p>
<p>Ultimately, this is in preparation for the Greater Community, where freedom is rare and where freedom must be guarded with great vigilance. This is a reality of life. Deny this and you deny life. You deny the lessons of life and the wisdom of life.</p>
<p>最终，这是为大社区的准备，在那里自由是稀缺的，在那里自由必须被高度警惕地守护。这是生命的现实。否认这一点，你就否认了生命。你就否认了生命的教训和生命的智慧。</p>
<p>It is time for humanity to become strong, to become self-determined, to become responsible and accountable, to end its ceaseless conflicts, to preserve and husband its valuable natural resources, to stabilize its population and to resist any intervention into the world by any force, regardless of their promises or their admonitions.</p>
<p>现在是人类变得强大、变得自决、变得负责和有义务的时候了，是结束无休止的冲突、保护和节约宝贵的自然资源、稳定人口、抵制任何势力对世界的干涉的时候了，无论他们做出什么承诺或发出什么警告。</p>
<p>This is your responsibility now. Human sovereignty must be preserved in this world. And this sovereignty will be coming under increasing threat and challenge, both by the difficulties you face here in the world and by competition and Intervention from beyond.</p>
<p>这就是你现在的责任。人类主权必须在这个世界上得到维护。而这个主权正面临日益增长的威胁和挑战，既来自你们在这个世界上所面临的困境，也来自外来的竞争和干预。</p>
<p>Intervention will exploit human weakness, but you must build human strength and self-confidence. This begins with the individual. It is not simply a mandate by government or a philosophy.</p>
<p>干预会利用人类的弱点，但你必须建立人类的实力和自信。这始于个人。这不仅仅是政府的命令或一种哲学。</p>
<p>If humanity does not preserve its freedom, it will be lost. If you cannot recognize you are facing competition from beyond the world, this presence and this power will gain ever-greater strength and persuasion here.</p>
<p>如果人类不守护它的自由，它就会失去。如果你们不能认识到你们正面临来自世界之外的竞争，那么这种存在和这种权力将在这里获得越来越大的实力和说服力。</p>
<p>This is where the strength of your moral character, the strength of your religions, the strength and the value of humanity’s creativity and Divine nature become essential to emphasize.</p>
<p>这正是你们的道德品质的力量、你们的宗教的力量、人类创造力和神圣自然的力量和价值必须强调的地方。</p>
<p>You have your backs to the universe. You must turn and face the Greater Community. You must watch your skies. And you must check the power and the presence and activities of the Intervention. It is operating now with very little human awareness and very little human discernment.</p>
<p>你们背对着宇宙。你们必须转身面向大社区。你们必须观望你们的天空。你们必须检视干预的力量、存在和活动。它现在在极少人类的觉知和极少人类的辨别力之下运作着。</p>
<p>Remove its veil of secrecy, and it is exposed. Its weakness is exposed. Its deception is exposed. Its false promises are exposed. This is what is necessary now.</p>
<p>揭开它的神秘面纱，它的真面目就暴露无遗了。它的弱点暴露无遗。它的欺骗暴露无遗。它的虚假承诺暴露无遗。这正是现在所需要的。</p>
<p>Humanity has the power of Knowledge. The awareness of Knowledge has not been lost within the world. That is what makes you valuable to other free races in the universe and worthy of their support.</p>
<p>人类拥有内识的力量。内识的觉知并未在世界内消失。这让你们对宇宙中其他自由种族而言弥足珍贵，值得他们支持。</p>
<p>It is the power of Knowledge and human determination and human cooperation that will give you strength and will enable you to establish yourself as a free and powerful race in the universe.</p>
<p>正是内识的力量、人类的决心和人类的合作，将赋予你们力量，并使你们能够成为宇宙中一个自由而强大的种族。</p>
<p>This is your challenge. Humanity has a great advantage here. And it must use this advantage with all of its might and determination.</p>
<p>这是你们的挑战。人类在这方面拥有巨大的优势。它必须竭尽全力、坚定决心，充分使用这个优势。</p>
<p>This is a Message of Love from God. It is a Message of confidence and encouragement. It brings with it a warning, but it also brings with it an assurance. All that God has invested in humanity and the development of human civilization means that God values the human life and human family and does not want to see you fall under subjugation of foreign control.</p>
<p>这是一条来自上帝爱的讯息。它是充满信心和鼓励的讯息。它带来警告，也带来保证。上帝对人类和人类文明发展的一切投入，意味着上帝珍视人类的生命和人类大家庭，不愿看到你们沦为外来控制的奴役。</p>
<p>For the power of freedom and the power of God are the same, here and everywhere in the universe. And here and everywhere in the universe, freedom must be protected and nurtured and supported. For everywhere in life, it is challenged.</p>
<p>因为自由的力量与上帝的力量是相同的，无论在这里还是在宇宙的任何地方。而在这里以及宇宙的任何地方，自由都必须得到保护、培育和支持。因为在生命中，自由无处不在，它受到挑战。</p>
<p>It is a gift. It is a gift that you as an individual and you as a member of a Spiritual Family must advocate for, preserve and protect.</p>
<p>它是一份礼物。这份礼物是你作为个体，以及作为精神家庭成员必须倡导、维护和保护的。</p>
