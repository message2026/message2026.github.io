<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on January 23, 2009 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2009 年 1 月 23 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be difficult to break old habits. It can be difficult to set aside things that have been with you for a long time—preoccupations, behaviors, activities, interests, hobbies and so forth. People can hold onto these things long after they have ceased to have any real meaning, if they ever had any real meaning to begin with.</p>
<p>打破旧的习惯可能很难。放下那些伴随你许久的事情——那些专注的事情、行为、活动、兴趣、爱好等等——也可能很难。人们可以长久地保留这些东西，即使它们不再具有任何真正的意义——如果它们曾经有过任何真正的意义的话。</p>
<p>People talk about change. They say how much they have changed, or that they want to change. But you must ask yourself: “Do people really change at all?” Or are the changes that they make more cosmetic or circumstantial in nature?</p>
<p>人们谈论改变。他们说他们如何改变了，或者说他们想要改变。但你必须扪心自问：“人们真的改变了吗？”或者，他们做出的改变只是表面的、间接的改变？</p>
<p>Real change is a change of heart. And a change of heart shifts your focus, your priorities and, as a consequence, your relationship with many things. Change without a change of heart is not really change. It is only cosmetic in nature. It is looking different, sounding different. But on the inside a real shift has not yet occurred.</p>
<p>真正的改变是内心的改变。内心的改变会改变你的关注点、你的优先事项，以及你与许多事物的关系。没有内心改变的改变并非真正的改变。它只是表面的改变。它看起来不一样，听起来不一样。但内心深处，真正的转变尚未发生。</p>
<p>It is this change of heart that is so essential. It is this that will give you the power to break your addiction to things, your association with things, and to help you re-evaluate your position regarding everyone and everything.</p>
<p>正是这种内心的改变至关重要。正是这种改变赋予你力量，让你摆脱对事物的沉迷，摆脱与事物的关联，并帮助你重新评估你对每个人、每件事的立场。</p>
<p>Real change happens beneath the surface. It is not something that occurs at the intellectual level. It is a shift at a deeper level. And over time you come to realize, as a consequence, that your values and your priorities are changing. The way you feel about yourself and your situation is changing. You are looking for different things now. You are losing interest in things that fascinated you before.</p>
<p>真正的改变发生在表象之下。它并非发生在智力层面，而是更深层次层面的转变。随着时间的推移，你会意识到，你的价值观和优先事项正在改变。你对你自己和处境的感受也在改变。你现在正在寻找不同的东西。你对以前让你着迷的事物失去了兴趣。</p>
<p>To really break an addiction you must have a different kind of focus for the mind that must really be all consuming. It may even look like another addiction. But it must be strong enough to displace and replace what has captivated your mind previously, and what still tends to captivate your mind.</p>
<p>要真正戒除成瘾，你必须对心灵有另一种专注，这种专注必须真正地吞噬一切。它甚至可能看起来像另一种成瘾。但它必须足够强大，能够取代之前以及现在仍然萦绕你心头的事物。</p>
<p>Instead of being addicted to a drug, you become addicted to God. You become addicted to the experience of Knowledge within yourself, the deeper Intelligence that God has placed within you. You become addicted to serving others. You become addicted to maintaining your health. This new addiction may be temporary, but it serves as a bridge, you see.</p>
<p>你不再沉迷于毒品，而是沉迷于上帝。你沉迷于你自己内在的内识体验，沉迷于上帝放置在你内在的更深层次的智能。你沉迷于服务他人。你沉迷于维护你的健康。这种新的沉迷或许是暂时的，但它充当着一座桥梁，你看。</p>
<p>You can question your motivations about your current addictions. You can try to understand what created these conditions. You may gain a psychological perspective regarding your behaviors. You may see a connection between early events in your life and the kinds of fixations that are haunting you now. But this does not mean that you can really let go, and that you will have the strength and the capacity to do that.</p>
<p>你可以质疑你当前成瘾的动机。你可以尝试理解造成这些状况的原因。你或许可以从心理学角度审视你的行为。你或许能发现早年经历与如今困扰你的执念之间的联系。但这并不意味着你真的可以放下，也不意味着你拥有放下的力量和能力。</p>
<p>An addiction is a replacement for real relationships. That is a very useful definition of addictions. It is a replacement for real relationship with yourself, with other people and with the world.</p>
<p>上瘾取代了真实的关系。这是一个非常有用的定义。它取代了你与你自己、与他人、与世界之间的真实关系。</p>
<p>People lose their relationship with themselves and must replace it with something. They must have something to which they are dedicated, that occupies their focus and their time. And so instead of that which is real and meaningful, they have chosen a substitute. And these substitutes, at the very least, consume one’s attention and, at the very worst, destroy one’s life.</p>
<p>人们失去了与他们自己的关系，必须用某种东西来取代它。他们必须拥有某种能够全身心投入、占据他们注意力和时间的东西。于是，他们选择了替代品，而不是那些真实而有意义的东西。而这些替代品，至少会消耗一个人的注意力，在最坏的情况下，会毁掉一个人的生命。</p>
<p>If an addiction has reached this stage of advancement, then it must be replaced by something of equal force and strength. You must now become addicted to something else that points your life in the right direction, that reaffirms your natural abilities and native worth. It is still obsessive, of course, because you have not yet reached a real balance within yourself. But as a replacement, if it can garner enough attention from you and focus, then it can serve to alter the course of your life and turn you away from meaningless and self-destructive behaviors.</p>
<p>如果一种成瘾已经发展到这种程度，就必须用某种同等力量和强度的东西来取代它。现在，你必须沉迷于某种能指引你生命正确方向、能再次肯定你天赋和内在价值的东西。当然，它仍然令人着迷，因为你内心尚未达到真正的平衡。但作为替代，如果它能引起你足够的关注和专注，那么它就能改变你的生命轨迹，让你远离那些毫无意义、自我毁灭的行为。</p>
<p>That is why certain people who were addicted to drugs or other kinds of fantasies turn to religion with such adamancy, such fervency. It is because they are trying to replace one addiction with another. Perhaps they were addicted to drugs and now they are addicted to Jesus or Muhammad or the church or the mosque. They are still addicted, which means their life is still out of balance, and they are still prone to make excessive and unwise decisions. But they are attempting to shift their life onto a different plane, and they are using religion or belief, or the lives of the great emissaries as a means of doing this.</p>
<p>这就是为什么某些曾经沉迷于毒品或其他幻想的人，会如此坚定、如此狂热地转向宗教。这是因为他们试图用一种瘾来取代另一种瘾。或许他们曾经沉迷于毒品，现在却沉迷于耶稣、穆罕默德、教堂或清真寺。他们仍然沉迷其中，这意味着他们的生命仍然失衡，仍然容易做出过度和不明智的决定。但他​​们试图将他们的生命提升到一个不同的层面，他们利用宗教、信仰，或者伟大使者的生命作为实现这个目标的手段。</p>
<p>Your addiction to romance, your addiction to your fantasies about your hobbies, your addictions to certain kinds of foods or activities must be replaced by something of equal or greater importance. You cannot simply dissolve an addiction through understanding and awareness. You must replace that addiction with something else. Otherwise, you will be struggling continuously, trying to avoid and to deny and to repudiate your obsessive behaviors and tendencies. They are still operating within you even though you understand what they are and can think about them objectively.</p>
<p>你对浪漫的沉迷，你对爱好幻想的沉迷，你对某些食物或活动的沉迷，都必须被同等或更重要的事物所取代。你不能仅仅通过理解和觉知来化解沉迷。你必须用其他事物来取代它。否则，你将不断挣扎，试图逃避、否认和拒绝你的强迫行为和倾向。即使你理解了它们是什么，并能够客观地思考它们，它们仍然在你体内运作。</p>
<p>A person who has been addicted to eating bad food and has become unhealthy and overweight can become addicted to health and athletics. But eventually they will have to deal with the real Four Pillars of their life: the Pillar of Health, the Pillar of Relationships, the Pillar of Work and Providership and the Pillar of their Spiritual Development.</p>
<p>一个沉迷于吃垃圾食品、身体不健康、体重超标的人，可能会沉迷于健康和运动。但最终，他们必须面对生命真正的四大支柱：健康支柱、关系支柱、工作与供养支柱，以及精神发展支柱。</p>
<p>Addiction and obsession occur when these Four Pillars are not being attended to adequately. That is why obsession and addiction represent a life that is out of harmony and out of balance. The teaching about the Four Pillars and the whole Four Pillar approach to life is the perfect antidote to obsession and obsessive behavior because it requires so much work, so much care, and so much attention being given to all of the fundamental elements of your life—all of which fall into one or more of these Pillars—that you do not have time to be obsessive or compulsive. You are taking on a life that requires you to be responsible all the time, to be aware and conscious all the time.</p>
<p>当这四大支柱未得到充分关注时，就会出现成瘾和强迫症。正因如此，强迫症和成瘾代表着一种失调失衡的生命。关于四大支柱的教导以及四大支柱的整个生活方式，是治疗强迫症和强迫行为的完美良药，因为它需要你投入如此多的努力、如此多的关怀和如此多的关注，去关注你生命的所有基本要素——所有这些要素都属于这一个或多个支柱——以至于你没有时间去强迫或沉迷。你正在过着一种需要你时刻负责、时刻保持觉知和清醒的生命。</p>
<p>So even if you replace an unhealthy addiction with something that is healthier, you must eventually deal with the Four Pillars of your life. This is what really begins to establish a new and strong foundation for you, and puts distance between you and your former existence and all of the tribulations that were created there.</p>
<p>所以，即使你用更健康的东西取代了不健康的瘾，你最终也必须处理好你生命的四大支柱。这才是真正开始为你建立全新而坚实的基础，并让你与过去的生命以及由此产生的所有磨难保持距离。</p>
<p>If you have been a person who has been obsessive or addicted to substances or other things, you must recognize that you have a compulsive-obsessive nature. And now you must manage that nature. You cannot make it go away. You cannot dissolve it by telling yourself that it is over. You cannot replace it with happy thoughts, or even with religious beliefs. You will have these tendencies ongoing. You cannot erase them, but you must learn to manage them. And management, self-management, is the issue here.</p>
<p>如果你曾经对物质或其他事物有强迫症或上瘾的倾向，你必须认识到你有强迫症的天性。现在你必须控制这种天性。你无法让它消失。你无法通过告诉你自己一切都结束了来化解它。你无法用快乐的想法，甚至宗教信仰来取代它。这些倾向会持续存在。你无法消除它们，但你必须学会​​控制它们。而控制，自我管理，正是这里的关键所在。</p>
<p>If you are engaged in any activity that is out of harmony with your values, then you are generating conflict, and you are losing energy to that. It is robbing you of life. It is robbing you of time. It is robbing you of self-confidence. It is robbing you of your self-esteem. It is taking you away from the real focus of your life and your ability to discover the greater purpose that has brought you into the world.</p>
<p>如果你从事任何与你的价值观不一致的活动，那么你就是在制造冲突，你在为此浪费能量。它正在夺走你的生命。它正在夺走你的时间。它正在夺走你的自信。它正在夺走你的自尊。它正在带你远离你生命的真正焦点，以及你发现将你带到这个世界的更伟大目的的能力。</p>
<p>That is why you must manage obsessive tendencies. Replace them if you can with more beneficial activities. Shift your insecurity and your lack of stability, which drive your self-obsession, to focus on other things that are demanding of you. But they must be powerful replacements.</p>
<p>这就是为什么你必须控制强迫症倾向。如果可以的话，用更有益的活动来取代它们。转移你的不安全感和缺乏稳定性——这些正是你自我痴迷的根源——去关注其他对你有要求的事情。但它们必须是强有力的替代品。</p>
<p>If you are a compulsive eater, then you will have to be a compulsive athlete to correct these tendencies. But that is only the beginning of your transition. You must then move into a focus upon the Four Pillars of your life, each of which will require a considerable amount of your time on a regular basis.</p>
<p>如果你有强迫性进食，那么你必须成为一名强迫性运动者来纠正这些倾向。但这仅仅是你转变的开始。之后，你必须专注于你生命的四大支柱，而每个支柱都需要你定期投入大量的时间。</p>
<p>If your behaviors are not in keeping with your values, it will generate self-conflict and self-doubt within you. What are the behaviors that you engage in now that are not in keeping with your values or your sense of integrity? Write these down and really focus upon them. See what kind of behaviors or activities could replace these things that would be in keeping with your values and your sense of integrity.</p>
<p>如果你的行为不符合你的价值观，你的内心就会产生自我冲突和自我怀疑。你现在有哪些行为不符合你的价值观或你的完整感？把它们写下来，认真思考。看看哪些行为或活动可以取代这些符合你价值观和完整感的行为。</p>
<p>Integrity means that you are one person: you are the same person in all situations, with only slight modifications for social adaptability; you are guided by one true impulse within yourself; that you are not moving in many directions at once; that you are unified and harmonized within yourself.</p>
<p>完整性意味着你是一个人：在任何情况下你都是同一个人，只有轻微的调整以适应社会；你被你自己内心的一种真实冲动所引导；你不会同时朝多个方向移动；你内心是统一而和谐的。</p>
<p>But to reach this state of integrity, it requires that your thinking and your behavior and your associations with others must be in keeping with your real values. Your real values are different from social values, which have been impressed upon you since childhood. The real values are your real values, that which is in keeping with Knowledge [the deeper intelligence] within yourself.</p>
<p>但为了达到这种完整性的状态，它要求你的思维、你的行为以及你与他人的交往必须符合你真正的价值观。你的真正价值观不同于社会价值观，后者从童年起就被灌输给你。真正的价值观是你真正的价值观，它与你内在的内识（更深层次的智能）相一致。</p>
<p>You may have to make compromises in your work, but you should not make serious compromises in your relationships with others. You should not make compromises regarding your personal behavior and activities.</p>
<p>你可能不得不在工作中做出妥协，但在与他人的关系中，你不应该做出严重的妥协。你不应该在个人行为和活动上做出妥协。</p>
<p>If you violate yourself, you will feel violated, and you will be angry and frustrated. And this anger and frustration will be projected upon others in the form of accusations, blame and condemnation. You will hate others for the things that you yourself cannot accomplish. You will point the finger at other people’s failures because they represent your own. Everyone has much work to do in this regard. No one is exempt.</p>
<p>如果你违背你自己，你会感到被侵犯，你会感到愤怒和沮丧。而这种愤怒和沮丧会以指责、责备和谴责的形式投射到他人身上。你会因为你自己无法完成的事情而憎恨他人。你会指责他人的失败，因为他们代表了你自己的失败。在这方面，每个人都有很多工作要做。没有人可以例外。</p>
<p>There are so few people who are strong with Knowledge—whose lives are really integrated, who are really in harmony with themselves in their lives—that there are almost no exceptions to what We are presenting here. People are violating themselves in countless ways, all the time, everywhere. They are violating themselves through their behavior, through their associations with others, through their ideas and beliefs, through their political and religious involvements, through their own personal behavior and standards. This has to do with you, and everyone.</p>
<p>拥有强大内识的人如此之少——他们的生命真正整合，他们的生命真正与他们自己和谐——以至于我们在此呈现的几乎没有例外。人们以无数种方式、无时无刻、无处不在地侵犯着他们自己。他们通过他们的行为、通过他们与他人的交往、通过他们的想法和信仰、通过他们的政治和宗教参与、通过他们自身的个人行为和标准来侵犯着他们自己。这关系到你，关系到每个人。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you really gives you your true values, your true standards, because in your heart you know what is right and what is not. And this can be in grave conflict with your ideology or your beliefs, or your submission to the beliefs of others.</p>
<p>你内在的内识实际赋予你真正的价值观，真正的标准，因为你内心深处知道什么是对，什么是错。而这可能与你的意识形态、你的信仰，或者你对他人的信仰的顺从，存在着严重的冲突。</p>
<p>People can be addicted to ideas as much as they can be addicted to drugs. They can be addicted to romance. They can be addicted to the acquisition of wealth, taking risks, and winning the game. There are countless things that people are addicted to, but they all represent a substitute for Knowledge, and a kind of compensation for a life that is fundamentally out of balance and filled with insecurity and uncertainty. The manifestation of addiction is tremendous and varied. People can be addicted to the most innocuous things or the most dangerous things.</p>
<p>人们沉迷于想法，就像沉迷于毒品一样。他们可能沉迷于浪漫，也可能沉迷于获取财富、冒险和赢得胜利。人们沉迷的事物数不胜数，但它们都代表着内识的替代品，以及对失衡、充满不安全感和不确定性生命的一种补偿。成瘾的表现形式多种多样，种类繁多。人们可能沉迷于最无害的事物，也可能沉迷于最危险的事物。</p>
<p>You know you are addicted when you think you cannot do without something that you can really do without. There are essential needs like food, water, shelter, clothing and security. There are important needs that are not essential such as companionship, sexuality, social engagements, artistic expression. Next, there are needs that are neither very important nor essential, and this includes a vast array of human activities.</p>
<p>当你觉得有些事情你真的可以没有却又离不开的时候，你就知道你上瘾了。有些需求是必需的，比如食物、水、住所、衣服和安全。有些需求很重要，但并非必需，比如陪伴、性、社交活动、艺术表达。此外，还有一些需求既不是非常重要也不是必需的，这涵盖了各种各样的人类活动。</p>
<p>You know you are addicted when you cannot do without something that is really not essential, when you believe that you cannot function without something when in reality it is not essential for your survival and well-being, particularly if it does not meet the first two criteria of that which is a need that is essential and an important need that is not essential. Beyond this, you must be willing to let go of anything that stands in your way, or that is impeding your progress, or that is compromising your integrity.</p>
<p>当你无法摆脱某种并非真正必需的东西时，当你相信没有它你就无法正常生活，而实际上它对你的生存和福祉并非至关重要时，你就知道自己上瘾了，尤其是当它不符合前两个标准：必需的需求和重要但非必需的需求。除此之外，你必须愿意放弃任何阻碍你前进、阻碍你进步或损害你完整性的东西。</p>
<p>Addictions to food, addictions to pleasures, addictions to places, addictions to people, addictions to certain kinds of personality types, addictions to beauty, addictions to wealth, addictions to power, addictions to hobbies, addictions to sports, addictions to things that appear to be healthy but which in fact have become obsessive because they are displacing the other Pillars of one’s life.</p>
<p>对食物的上瘾、对快乐的上瘾、对地方的上瘾、对人的上瘾、对某些性格类型的上瘾、对美貌的上瘾、对财富的上瘾、对权力的上瘾、对爱好的上瘾、对运动的上瘾、对一些看似健康但实际上已经变得强迫性的事物的上瘾，因为它们取代了一个人生命的其他支柱。</p>
<p>Here a healthy activity or a personal interest can easily grow beyond the bounds of its value and benefit, overtaking a person incrementally until they find themselves so focused upon that, when in fact it is a very minor thing in their life. People become obsessed with athletic activities or with sports or with hobbies that began as a healthy interest and now have become something that is more dominating to the individual.</p>
<p>在这里，一项健康的活动或个人兴趣很容易超越其价值和益处的界限，逐渐超越一个人，直到他们发现他们自己如此专注于此，而实际上它只是他们生命中一件非常小的事情。人们沉迷于体育活动、体育运动或爱好，这些最初只是出于健康的兴趣，如今却变成了对个人更具主导性的事情。</p>
<p>You can think of so many other situations that are obsessive and addictive because people all around you are engaged in so many different expressions of this fundamental problem of not being engaged with Knowledge and of having your life out of balance and out of integrity with your deeper values.</p>
<p>你可以想到很多其他令人痴迷和上瘾的情况，因为你周围的人都在以很多不同的方式表达这个根本性问题：不参与内识，你的生命失去平衡，与你更深层次的价值观格格不入。</p>
<p>You can begin to see here that if you have a really disabling addiction, it is going to take a very strong form of activity to correct it. Going to the therapist and talking about it and gaining an understanding will not be enough to overcome it and to overwhelm it and to displace it in your experience. You are going to have to take on something that is much more intense and demanding, an activity and not just an understanding, or a set of activities that are so incompatible with your former addiction that you simply cannot do both in one life. That is why the remedy has to be very powerful; it has to be very demanding.</p>
<p>在这里你可以开始看到，如果你真的患有一种致残性成瘾，就需要采取非常强有力的行动来纠正它。去找治疗师谈论它、获得理解并不足以克服它、压倒它、取代它在你的体验中的位置。你必须采取一些更强烈、更艰巨的行动，一项活动而非仅仅一种理解，或者一系列与你之前的成瘾如此不相容的活动，以至于你根本无法在生命中同时做到这两点。这就是为什么治疗必须非常有力；它必须非常艰巨。</p>
<p>If you are going to go through the great difficulty of liberating yourself from an addiction to a drug, which can be a serious addiction, or any other disabling activity, it is going to take a very strong approach. You may have to leave all your former relationships. You may have to move to a very different place, put yourself in a very different set of circumstances permanently in order to have the opportunity to build a new life and experience of yourself. It will take a very strong effort to correct a life of obsession or addictive behavior.</p>
<p>如果你要克服巨大的困难，摆脱毒瘾（这可能是一种严重的成瘾，也可能是任何其他令人丧失行动能力的行为），那么你需要采取非常强硬的措施。你可能不得不断绝所有以前的关系。你可能不得不搬到一个完全不同的地方，永远地把你自己置于一个完全不同的环境中，才能有机会建立新的生命和新的自我体验。纠正生命中的痴迷或成瘾行为需要付出巨大的努力。</p>
<p>There are rare cases where people simply lose interest in something and are able to escape these fixations, but this tends to be the exception, and to be exceptional itself. With the emergence of Knowledge, you will lose interest in things that are out of keeping with your deeper nature and your greater purpose for being in the world. Losing interest here will be gradual and progressive. But for some people, this will not be enough to get them over the top, to break the chains of addiction.</p>
<p>罕见的情况下，人们只是对某事失去兴趣，并能够摆脱这些执着，但这往往是例外，而且本身就是例外。随着内识的呈现，你将对那些与你更深层次自然以及你身处世界的更伟大目的不符的事物失去兴趣。在这里，失去兴趣将是循序渐进的。但对一些人来说，这不足以让他们超越极限，打破成瘾的锁链。</p>
<p>We, of course, recommend taking the Steps to Knowledge as the foundation for any necessary improvement in your inner and outer life. For without this, you are relying upon ideas alone, and ideas do not have the power that Knowledge has. Ideas alone do not have the power to break the chains of addiction or obsessive behaviors.</p>
<p>当然，我们建议你践行内识进阶，作为你内在和外在生命任何必要改进的基础。因为没有它，你就只能依赖想法，而想法并不具备内识所拥有的力量。想法本身并不具备打破成瘾或强迫行为锁链的力量。</p>
<p>What this really means is creating a new life and tearing down the old life because you cannot put a new life on top of an old life. You have to dismantle the old life to a very great degree to be able to build something else in its place. This takes a great effort and great courage. You have to break your identification with your behaviors, with your ideas and with your history. That takes great courage and effort.</p>
<p>这实际上意味着创造新的生命，摧毁旧的生命，因为你无法将新的生命置于旧的生命之上。你必须彻底摧毁旧的生命，才能在旧的生命基础上建立新的生命。这需要伟大的努力和勇气。你必须打破你对你的行为、你的想法、你的历史的认同。这需要伟大的勇气和努力。</p>
<p>Knowledge will give you the power to do this and the inspiration to do this, but never think it is going to be easy or quick. You do not dismantle a life that you have been fortifying for decades in a matter of days, weeks, months, or even a year. You must be prepared to put yourself in very different circumstances, around people presenting very different influences, to be able to really create a new foundation for yourself.</p>
<p>内识会赋予你力量和灵感，但千万不要认为这会轻而易举或一蹴而就。你不可能在几天、几周、几个月甚至一年的时间里，就摧毁你几十年来精心打造的一种生命。你必须做好准备，置身于截然不同的环境中，与那些对你影响迥异的人相处，才能真正为你自己奠定新的基础。</p>
<p>For even the best seed will not grow in poor soil; even the most beautiful plant cannot grow amidst a field of weeds. You must find fertile soil. And this fertile soil really is your environment and your relationships.</p>
<p>因为即使是最好的种子，也无法在贫瘠的土壤中生长；即使是最美丽的植物，也无法在杂草丛生的田野中生长。你必须找到肥沃的土壤。而这片肥沃的土壤，实际上就是你的环境和你的关系。</p>
<p>If you stay with the same people, it will be very difficult to create a real change unless they are changing with you, and unless they are supporting your change wholeheartedly. People underestimate the power of their environment and their relationships to influence them and to dominate them. But nothing grows in poor soil; nothing thrives in impure waters. You cannot begin a new journey in life if you are held in place by your former life.</p>
<p>如果你和同一群人待在一起，除非他们也跟着你一起改变，除非他们全心全意地支持你的改变，否则很难带来真正的改变。人们低估了环境和关系对他们的影响和支配力。贫瘠的土壤里什么也种不出来；不纯净的水里什么也滋润不起来。如果你被过去的生命束缚着，你就无法开启生命的新旅程。</p>
<p>God has sent a New Message into the world for the redemption and protection of humanity. It has the power to lift you out of addiction and to prepare you to learn to build the Four Pillars of your life, even if you have not built them sufficiently before. It is the Power of God that resides within Knowledge within you, and it is the Power of God that is imbued in the New Message. It has not been corrupted or diluted by cultures or governments or the misuse of ambitious individuals. It is pure. It is powerful. It is real.</p>
<p>上帝为了人类的救赎和保护，向世界发来了一条新讯息。它拥有力量，能够让你摆脱成瘾，并让你进行准备，去学习构建你生命的四大支柱，即使你之前尚未充分构建它们。它是上帝的力量，存在于你内在的内识里，它是上帝的力量，蕴含在新讯息里。它没有被文化、政府或野心勃勃的个人所腐蚀或稀释。它是纯粹的。它是强大的。它是真实的。</p>
<p>To be with the New Message from God is as if you had a chance to be with a Jesus or a Muhammad or a Buddha in their lifetime, when the Revelation was real and fresh and pure and had not been corrupted and adapted to culture, and overlaid with tradition and ideology.</p>
<p>拥抱来自上帝的新讯息，就好像你有机会在耶稣、穆罕默德或佛陀的一生中与他们在一起，那时的启示是真实的、新鲜的、纯粹的，还没有被腐蚀和适应文化，也没有被传统和意识形态所覆盖。</p>
<p>The New Message has the power of redemption, but it still requires that you replace your obsessions with new behaviors, that you begin to build the Four Pillars of your life, and most fundamentally to gain a real connection with Knowledge within yourself that will give you the strength, the courage and the determination to begin a new journey in your life.</p>
<p>新讯息拥有救赎的力量，但它依然要求你用新的行为取代你的执念，要求你开始构建你生命的四大支柱，最根本的是，获得与你内在内识的一种真正联接，这将赋予你力量、勇气和决心，去开启你生命中的一段新旅程。</p>
<p>People talk about starting new journeys, but they are staying where they are—with the people that they are used to, with the ideas they are accustomed to, with the activities and behaviors that they have adapted to and where they feel secure. So nothing really happens. It is only a conversation; or perhaps it is a self-deception.</p>
<p>人们谈论着开启新的旅程，却依然停留在原地——和熟悉的人在一起，接受着习以为常的想法，过着适应了的活动和行为，在他们感到安全的地方。所以什么也没发生。它只是一场对话；或者，它是一种自欺欺人。</p>
<p>People think they are really changed when they have only just changed a few of their ideas and nothing else. They are still the same person with the same tendencies, the same weaknesses, the same frailties, the same deceptions, the same fantasies. Only it looks a little different because they have changed their perspective about it.</p>
<p>人们认为他们真的改变了，其实他们只是改变了一些想法，其他什么都没改变。他们还是同一个人，有着同样的倾向、同样的弱点、同样的脆弱、同样的欺骗、同样的幻想。只是看起来略有不同，因为他们改变了看待事物的角度。</p>
<p>Yet they have not really begun to dismantle their former experience. They have not really broken the bonds that are holding them in place. They have not really begun the revolution that must happen within them to initiate a new life, a new awareness and a new experience of one’s self. To receive a New Message from God, you will go through this revolution. And perhaps you are going through it already.</p>
<p>然而，他们尚未真正开始瓦解他们过往的经验。他们尚未真正打破束缚他们的枷锁。他们尚未真正开始内在必须发生的革命，以开启新的生命、新的觉知和新的自我体验。为了接收来自上帝的新讯息，你将经历这场革命。或许，你正在经历它。</p>
<p>Many people have begun this process. But they have not found the reinforcement that they need, they have not found the inspiration that they need, they have not found the skills and understanding that they need to really begin anew—to build a foundation based upon Knowledge and not upon ideas or convenience. Some people know they have made little progress; others think they have made great progress when they have, in fact, barely even begun.</p>
<p>许多人已经开始了这个过程。但他们还没有找到他们需要的强化，他们还没有找到他们需要的灵感，他们还没有找到他们真正重新开始所需要的技能和理解——去构建一个基于内识而非想法或便利的基础。有些人知道他们几乎没有取得进展；其他人则认为他们取得了巨大的进展，而事实上，他们甚至才刚刚开始。</p>
<p>You will know that you have made progress when your life is in keeping with your deeper values, and when you have shifted your relationship with everything, when you have moved your sense of authority from your ideas and your intellect to the deeper wellspring of Knowledge within yourself. You will know you have really begun anew when you look for Knowledge in others and when you can look upon the world without condemnation.</p>
<p>当你的生命与你更深层次的价值观相符时，当你改变了你与一切事物的关系时，当你将你的权威感从你的想法和你的智力转移到你内在内识的更深层次源泉时，你将知道你已取得进步。当你在他人身上寻找内识时，当你能够不带谴责地看待世界时，你将知道你已经真正重新开始。</p>
<p>For Knowledge gives you this prescience, this vision, this awareness. Shifting from one ideology to another, from one system of belief to another, does not represent a real shift of any kind unless it is a shift that has happened at a deeper level within you, and unless it generates a very different kind of orientation and behavior on your part.</p>
<p>因为内识赋予你这种先见、这种视野、这种觉知。从一种意识形态到另一种意识形态的转变，从一种信仰体系到另一种信仰体系的转变，并不代表任何形式的真正转变，除非这种转变发生在你内在更深层次的层面，除非它在你的内心生成一种非常不同的取向和行为。</p>
<p>To go from being an angry and vengeful partisan in the political arena to being an angry, vengeful person in a religious arena does not demonstrate any real change at all. It is just you are expressing your instability and aberrancy in a different context. Your life looks different, sounds different, but in a sense is exactly the same.</p>
<p>从政治舞台上愤怒复仇的党派人士，到宗教舞台上愤怒复仇的人士，根本不代表任何真正的改变。你只不过是在不同的语境中表达你的不稳定和反常而已。你的生命看起来不同，听起来不同，但某种意义上来说，却完全一样。</p>
<p>So We are not talking about a makeover here, or a change in style, or a change in rhetoric, or a change in fashion, but a fundamental shift within you. It enables you to break the chains of addiction and to begin to build the Four Pillars of your life, which will occupy you completely and free your mind once your life is in keeping with your deeper values and with the reality of Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>因此我们在此谈论的并非是改头换面，或风格的改变，或修辞的改变，或时尚的改变，而是你内在的根本性转变。它使你能够打破成瘾的枷锁，并开始构建你生命的四大支柱，一旦你的生命与你更深层次的价值观以及你内在内识的现实相符，这将完全占据你，并解放你的心灵。</p>
<p>God is calling you to respond. God is calling you through the New Message that God has sent into the world, a Message that is unlike anything that has ever been given to humanity before, to prepare humanity for a future that will be unlike anything the human family as a whole has ever had to face.</p>
<p>上帝正在召唤你去回应。上帝正在通过上帝发送给世界的新讯息召唤你，这个讯息不同于人类过去被赋予的任何讯息，它是为了帮助人类为一个与整个人类大家庭曾经面对的任何事物都不同的未来进行准备。</p>
<p>But this Calling requires a deep response from you, a deep commitment to build a new foundation in your life and an awareness within yourself that this is really what you want and need to do. The truth can only speak to the truth in you, and in so doing, it will reveal everything that is weak, false and unnecessary. God’s New Message will speak to what is true and inherent within you, and in so doing will reveal everything that is weak, false and unnecessary in your life.</p>
<p>但这个召唤需要你一种深度的回应，需要你深刻的承诺去构建你生命中的新基础，需要你内在的觉知，意识到这才是你自己真正想要和需要做的。真理只能对你内在的真理讲话，如此一来，它将揭示一切软弱、虚假和不必要的事情。上帝的新讯息将对你内在的真实和固有本质讲话，如此一来，它将揭示你生命中一切软弱、虚假和不必要的事物。</p>
<p>You must be willing to face this, to accept this, not merely as a recognition but as something that you realize is essential. For if you are really honest with yourself, you will begin to see that your life is not really where it needs to be and that this is the case for most people. They are not where they need to be personally, in their relationships or activities. Even geographically, they might be in the wrong place, and that is why nothing is really happening for them.</p>
<p>你必须愿意面对这一点，接受这一点，而不仅仅是承认这一点，而是认识到这一点是至关重要的。因为，如果你真的对你自己诚实，你就会开始发现，你的生命并没有真正达到它所需要的状态，而大多数人都是如此。他们并没有处于他们个人、人际关系或活动中应该处于的状态。甚至从地理位置上来说，他们也可能处在错误的地方，这就是为什么对他们来说什么都没有发生。</p>
<p>To respond to a New Message from God and to respond to the greater purpose that has sent you into the world requires a kind of revolution within yourself—where your former dictators are overthrown and replaced by wise counselors; where your former degrading behavior and experiences are replaced by that which is inspiring, meaningful and productive.</p>
<p>为了回应来自上帝的一条新讯息，为了回应派你来到世界的更伟大目的，需要你内在的一种革命——你以前的独裁者被推翻，并被明智的顾问取代；你以前的堕落行为和体验被那些鼓舞人心、有意义和富有成效的事情取代。</p>
<p>Here you must attend to all Four Pillars of your life, which will create balance and strength. For your life is only as strong as the weakest of your Pillars. Like the four legs of a table, they uphold your life; the weakest leg determines the strength of that table.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须关注你生命的四大支柱，它们将创造平衡与力量。因为你的生命之强弱，取决于你最薄弱的支柱。就像桌子的四条腿，它们支撑着你的生命；最弱的那条腿决定了桌子的强度。</p>
<p>Everyone has addictions, great or small. They all emanate from the same lack of balance and awareness in one’s self. They all are a replacement for true relationships. They all represent a life that is out of balance. They all require a serious and determined approach, one that is carried out with compassion and patience, but with great strength and fortitude.</p>
<p>每个人都有或大或小的瘾症。它们都源于自身缺乏平衡和觉知。它们都取代了真正的关系。它们都代表着失衡的生命。它们都需要一种严肃而坚定的方法，一种充满同情和耐心，同时也需要伟大力量和毅力的方法。</p>
<p>Where will you find this strength? Where will you find this determination? You will find it in Knowledge. And that is why at the center of your redemption and your development and progress is taking the Steps to Knowledge because the closer you come to Knowledge, the more difficult it will be for you to make a mistake. And the more you will lose interest and identification with your former ideas and behaviors that have proven to be harmful and self-destructive to you.</p>
<p>你将在哪里找到这种力量？你将在哪里找到这种决心？你将在内识中找到它。正因为如此，你的救赎、你的发展和进步的核心是开展内识进阶，因为你越接近内识，你就越难以犯错。你就越会对你过去那些已被证明有害且自我毁灭的想法和行为失去兴趣和认同。</p>
<p>God’s New Message has provided the Steps to Knowledge in a form that anyone can practice and understand. The Way of Knowledge is taught in many traditions, but you may have to search to find a teacher wise enough to guide you in this matter, and such teachers are rare and hard to find in the world.</p>
<p>上帝的新讯息以一种任何人都可以实践和理解的形式提供了内识进阶。内识之路在诸多传统中被传授，但你可能需要寻觅一位足够睿智的导师来指导你，而这样的老师在世界上是罕见且难以寻觅的。</p>
<p>So the New Message provides a pathway that you can begin today to study and to apply. This will strengthen your connection to Knowledge, which will empower your life and show you where your true devotion, your true love, your true happiness resides, and where it has always resided.</p>
<p>因此，新讯息提供了一条你今天就可以开始学习和应用的道路。这将强化你与内识的联接，这将赋予你生命力量，并向你展示你真正的奉献、你真正的爱、你真正的幸福驻留何处，以及它一直以来驻留何处。</p>
<p>This restores your relationship with yourself, this gives clarity and meaning to your relationships with others, this reveals your real relationship for coming into the world and your purpose for being here. And this reunites you with your Source, which is the source of your strength, your meaning and your value. It is the Great Love that you carry, even at this moment.</p>
<p>这修复了你与你自己的关系，这赋予了你与他人的关系以清晰和意义，这揭示了你来到这个世界的真正关系以及你身处此地的目的。这让你与你的本源重新合一，它是你的力量、你的意义和你的价值的源泉。即使在此刻，你也怀揣着伟大的爱。</p>
