<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on September 26, 1995 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1995 年 9 月 26 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Creator has given you authority over the affairs of your life. This authority extends to what you think and to what you do, to your decision-making and to the results of these decisions.</p>
<p>造物主赋予你掌控生命事务的权柄。这权柄涵盖你的所思所行，也涵盖你的决策以及这些决策的结果。</p>
<p>The Creator has empowered you to become the captain of your own ship. Within this sphere of responsibility, you are encouraged to exercise your authority and to learn how to manage your thinking and affairs with wisdom.</p>
<p>造物主赋予你权力，让你成为你自己这艘船的船长。在这个责任的领域里，你被鼓励运用你的权威，并学习如何用智慧管理你的思维和事务。</p>
<p>The Creator knew that you could not do this on your own without Divine guidance within you, so the Creator has given you Knowledge—the greater Mind within you, a Mind which dwells beyond the reach of your intellect, beyond your grasp, but not beyond your experience. This is the greatest of all endowments, and this is the source of your authority.</p>
<p>造物主知道，如果没有你内在的神圣指引，你无法独自做到这一点，所以造物主赋予了你内识——你内在更伟大的心灵，这个心灵超越你的智力所能及，超越你的理解，但并不超越你的经验。这是所有天赋中最伟大的，也是你权威的源泉。</p>
<p>The Creator gave you this power so that you could learn to become strong and responsible, and so that you could find the road to union within yourself and the means for uniting with others.</p>
<p>造物主赋予你这种力量，以便你能够学会变得坚强和负责任，以便你能够找到你自己内心团结的道路以及与他人团结的方法。</p>
<p>The Creator realized that you needed to demonstrate your own strength and authority in order to reclaim your identity and to realize and to fulfill your mission in the world. If you relied on the Creator for all these things, you would never claim this authority, and you would never regain your true ability or your true function in life.</p>
<p>造物主意识到，你需要展现你自己的力量和权威，才能重新获得你的身份，才能认识到并完成你在世间的使命。如果你在所有这些事情上都依赖造物主，你就永远无法获得这份权威，也永远无法重获你真正的能力或你在生命中的真正运作。</p>
<p>At the outset of learning and living The Way of Knowledge, you must begin to exercise this authority. This is usually experienced through the power of decision, which you are entrusted to make and encouraged to use. Here many people stop because they are afraid that they cannot make a wise decision. Their decisions in the past have led them into such difficulty and have given them such tribulation that they cannot trust their own decisions.</p>
<p>在学习和践行内识之路之初，你必须开始运用这种权威。这通常通过决策的力量来体验，你被赋予决策的力量，并被鼓励运用它。许多人止步于此，因为他们害怕他们无法做出明智的决定。他们过去的决定让他们陷入困境，给他们带来了巨大的磨难，以至于他们不再相信他们自己的决定。</p>
<p>But here, in spite of many past errors, in spite of self-deception and the willingness to allow others to deceive you, you must begin again; you must start anew. Here you are encouraged to take responsibility for what you must do.</p>
<p>但在这里，尽管过去犯过许多错误，尽管你自欺欺人，甚至甘愿被人欺骗，你都必须重新开始；你必须重新出发。在这里，你被鼓励去承担你必须做的事的责任。</p>
<p>When someone comes to The Way of Knowledge and begins to read about The Way of Knowledge and the books of wisdom, they are exercising this authority already. They are saying to themselves: “I will select this material to read and to understand. I will make an attempt to understand and to experience what these great books of Wisdom are providing for me.” This is an act of exercising authority to a very small degree.</p>
<p>当一个人踏上内识之路，开始阅读关于内识之路和智慧之书时，他们就已经在行使这种权威了。他们对自己说：“我要选择这些材料来阅读和理解。我要尝试去理解和体验这些伟大的智慧之书为我提供的一切。” 这是一种在很小程度上行使权威的行为。</p>
<p>And even before someone comes to The Way of Knowledge, they have had to exercise this authority in making a new commitment to truth, in making a new commitment to self-honesty, in making a new commitment to choose a way that will not harm them and will lead them away from danger, conflict and tribulation.</p>
<p>甚至在人们踏上内识之路之前，他们就必须运用这个权威，对真理做出新的承诺，对自我诚实做出新的承诺，做出新的承诺选择一条不会伤害他们、带领他们远离危险、冲突和磨难的道路。</p>
<p>Exercising this authority, then, is crucial at every stage of your development. Even before you come to The Way of Knowledge, you have exercised this authority on your own behalf. Perhaps you still continue to follow the will of your personal mind in all of its recklessness and feverish pursuits. But to come to The Way of Knowledge, you have already exercised your true authority and have chosen not to follow false authorities that you have assigned to yourself or that you have assigned to others.</p>
<p>因此，在你发展的每一个阶段，运用这个权威都至关重要。甚至在你踏上内识之路之前，你就已经为你自己运用了这个权威。或许你仍在遵循你个人心灵的意志，遵循它所有的鲁莽和狂热的追求。但为了踏上内识之路，你已经运用了你真正的权威，并且选择不去遵循你赋予你自己或他人的虚假权威。</p>
<p>Your greater purpose and mission in life can only be known. Those who sent you into the world can only be known. The nature and reality of the Creator can only be known. Your true nature and reality can only be known. That is why you must learn The Way of Knowledge, for the answers to all the great questions in life, the fulfillment of all the genuine needs in life, are provided through Knowledge, for they can only be known, and they can only be experienced.</p>
<p>你生命中更伟大的目的和使命只能被知道。那些派遣你来到这个世界的存在只能被知道。造物主的自然和现实只能被知道。你的真正自然和现实只能被知道。正因为如此，你必须学习内识之路，因为生命中所有重大问题的答案，生命中所有真正需求的满足，都通过内识来提供，因为它们只能被知道，它们只能被体验。</p>
<p>Knowledge will bring you to this experience, step by step, and Knowledge will enable you to regain your strength, your self-confidence and your self-respect by enabling you to exercise the great authority that has been given to you.</p>
<p>内识将一步步引领你走向这个体验，内识将使你能够运用被赋予的伟大权威，从而重新获得你的力量、你的自信和你的自尊。</p>
<p>You cannot return to the Creator a miserable wretch. You cannot return to the Creator in a state of spiritual welfare. You must become strong. You must become inner directed. You must regain your self-respect and your confidence in Knowledge.</p>
<p>你无法以一个可怜的可怜虫的身份回归造物主。你无法以精神福利的状态回归造物主。你必须变得强大。你必须变得由内在引导。你必须重新获得你的自尊和你对内识的信心。</p>
<p>Here you step away from the false authority that you have given to yourself in thinking that you could guide and define your life through your desires, your fears and your ambitions. Here you step away from all the false authority that you have placed in others, where you have given your authority away.</p>
<p>在这里，你远离了你赋予你自己的虚假权威，因为你认为你可以通过你的渴望、你的恐惧和你的野心来引导和定义你的生命。在这里，你远离了你赋予他人的所有虚假权威，你在那里放弃了你的权威。</p>
<p>Instead, you come to Knowledge. You come because you know you must come. You take these Steps because you know you must move forward. You step away from the past because you know that you must step away from the past. You come to The Way of Knowledge because you know that it is the answer to your needs.</p>
<p>相反，你走向内识。你来，因为你知道你必须来。你踏出这些步伐，因为你知道你必须前进。你远离过去，因为你知道你必须远离过去。你走向内识之路，因为你知道它是你所需之物的答案。</p>
<p>It is the way. The only answer is to take the way, to follow the Steps to Knowledge. What other answer could there be? To restore to you your true purpose, your true nature and identity, you must take the Steps towards their realization. That is the only answer that is an answer. And to take these Steps, you must exercise your authority.</p>
<p>这就是道路。唯一的答案就是踏上这条道路，追随内识的进阶。还能有其他答案吗？为了恢复你真正的目的、你的真正本质和身份，你必须迈向实现它们的进阶。这才是真正的答案。而要迈出这些进阶，你必须运用你的权威。</p>
<p>At the outset, people have great difficulty in trying to practice this idea of exercising their authority. They will think that exercising their authority is assuring themselves that they will have everything they want and that they will avoid any kind of disappointment. They will not want to deny any aspect of themselves. They will not want to turn away from any desire.</p>
<p>起初，人们在尝试实践行使权威这个想法时会遇到很大困难。他们会认为，行使权威就是确保他们自己拥有一切想要的东西，并避免任何失望。他们不想否定他们自己的任何方面，也不想放弃任何欲望。</p>
<p>But this is not exercising your authority. This is merely being a slave to your impulses. This is being a follower to the authority that you have given to your desires, to your fears, to your ambitions or to the desires, fears and ambitions of others.</p>
<p>但这并不是在行使你的权威。这仅仅是成为你冲动的奴隶。这只不过是追随你赋予你的欲望、你的恐惧、你的野心或他人的欲望、恐惧和野心的权威。</p>
<p>Your authority here is Knowledge and Knowledge alone. That is the only real authority that you have. That is the only real power that you have. Your Knowledge contains the memory and the means for reclaiming your true ability, for recognizing your mission in life and for finding the means for its fulfillment. Nothing else can hold this for you.</p>
<p>你在这里的权威是内识，且唯有内识。这是你拥有的唯一真正的权威。这是你拥有的唯一真正的力量。你的内识包含着记忆，以及重新唤起你真正能力的方法，认知你生命中的使命，并找到实现它的方法。没有任何其他东西能够为你阻挡它。</p>
<p>Your desires cannot hold this for you. Your fears cannot hold this. Your ambitions cannot hold this. They lead in another direction. They lead you to give your power to other authorities and to become in bondage to them, believing all the while that you will not be happy without attempting to fulfill these things for yourself.</p>
<p>你的欲望无法为你守住这一点。你的恐惧无法守住这一点。你的野心也无法守住这一点。它们引领你走向另一个方向。它们引领你把你的权力交给其他权威，并成为他们的奴隶，同时你始终相信，如果不尝试为你自己实现这些目标，你就不会快乐。</p>
<p>But once a man or woman comes to The Way of Knowledge, they have learned already that there is a greater purpose that is driving them, and they cannot take the easy way of simply being a slave or a servant to their thoughts, their emotions or their beliefs. They have seen the great damage and disasters that these have created in their life, the great waste and misappropriation of their lifetime and life energy.</p>
<p>但一旦一个男人或女人踏上内识之路，他们就已经了解到，有一个更伟大的目的在驱动着他们，他们不能轻易地成为他们思想、他们的情感或他们的信仰的奴隶或仆人。他们已经看到这些在他们的生命中造成的巨大破坏和灾难，以及对他们生命和生命能量的巨大浪费和滥用。</p>
<p>Now they realize that there is something that is greater, that is beyond these simple things to which everyone gives themselves. They have a greater destiny. And so they begin to exercise their true authority in choosing the way to truth, and the way to truth will bring them to The Way of Knowledge.</p>
<p>现在，他们意识到，存在着更伟大的事情，超越了每个人为之奉献的这些简单事物。他们拥有更伟大的天命。因此，他们开始运用真正的权威，选择通往真理的道路，而这条通往真理的道路将引领他们走向内识之路。</p>
<p>You have a great authority within you. You do not need to appeal to the Creator or to the Angelic Host. You do not need to appeal to mysterious powers in the Greater Community of worlds. You need to come home to yourself, not the self that has been conditioned and created through your experience of being in the world, but to the greater Self that you have brought with you into the world from your Ancient Home. This holds your authority. This is where your strength and meaning reside.</p>
<p>你内在拥有伟大的权威。你无需诉诸造物主或天使群体。你无需诉诸大社区世界里的神秘力量。你需要回到你自己身边，不是那个通过你身处世间的体验而被熏陶和创造的自我，而是回归你从古老家园带到这个世界的更伟大自我。这蕴含着你的权威。这才是你的力量和意义所在。</p>
<p>Now people say, “Well, how can I decide what my real authority is and what my real authority is not? I have such strong feelings. I have such strong compulsive needs. I am driven to do this and to do that. I am so preoccupied with other things.”</p>
<p>现在人们会说：“好吧，我怎么才能决定什么是我真正的权威，什么不是？我的感受很强烈。我有很强烈的强迫性需求。我被驱使着去做这做那。我被其他事情占据了太多心思。”</p>
<p>And I say your real authority will speak very quietly and consistently. It does not argue. It does not debate. It does not choose options. It does not make deals. It does not only seek for that which looks profitable or advantageous.</p>
<p>我说，你真正的权威会非常平静而始终如一地说话。它不争论，不辩论，不做选择，不做交易，不只追求那些看起来有利可图或有利可图的事情。</p>
<p>When you go against your authority, you will feel a great discomfort within yourself. You will feel that something is wrong at a really deep part of yourself. This is an indication that Knowledge is with you and that you are going against it.</p>
<p>当你违背你的权威时，你会感到内心深处的巨大不适。你会感觉到你内心深处出了问题。这表明内识与你同在，而你正在违背它。</p>
<p>This is different from fear and anxiety that preoccupy the mind at the surface of the mind. We are speaking of something very deep and pervasive. You have had this experience of going against Knowledge. You have had this experience many times. Perhaps before you were not aware of it in the moment, but now you can become aware of it in the moment.</p>
<p>这不同于那些占据心灵表面的恐惧和焦虑。我们谈论的是一种非常深刻和普遍的事情。你曾经有过这种违背内识的经历。你曾经有过很多次这样的经历。或许之前你当时并没有察觉到这一点，但现在你能够当下察觉到它了。</p>
<p>One of the ways that you find Knowledge is by going against it and experiencing what this feels like within your mind and within your body—this sense of discomfort and estrangement. Here Knowledge will not criticize you. It will only withdraw and remain silent, for it has no condemnation. If its recommendation or its influence cannot be felt and accepted, it must simply wait until you can come back again.</p>
<p>你发现内识的方法之一，就是对抗它，并体验你心灵和身体内部的感受——这种不适和疏离感。在这里，内识不会批评你。它只会撤回并保持沉默，因为它没有谴责。如果它的建议或它的影响无法被感受和接受，它就必须简单地等待，直到你能够再次回归。</p>
<p>This is why there can never be a vengeful God or an angry Creator. Because Knowledge represents the Will and Intelligence of the Creator, it demonstrates how the Creator functions within you and within life.</p>
<p>这就是为什么永远不会存在一位复仇的上帝或一位愤怒的造物主。因为内识代表着造物主的意志和智慧，它展现了造物主如何在你内在以及生命内的运作。</p>
<p>Because people have given their authority away to foreign ideas and to distant powers, they think that whatever they receive or whatever they suffer for is from the Creator or from someone else, from some other person, from some government or from some Divine force.</p>
<p>因为人们把他们的权威交给了外来的想法和遥远的权力，所以他们认为他们所得到的一切或所遭受的一切都是来自造物主或其他、来自其他人、来自某个政府或来自某种神圣的力量。</p>
<p>They do not see that they are responsible for the management of their own ship. They must get out and clean the decks. They must unfurl the sails. They must repair the rigging. They must steer the ship. They must maintain the condition of their vehicle, which is their mind and their body.</p>
<p>他们没有看到他们有责任管理好他们自己的船。他们必须下船，清理甲板。他们必须张开船帆。他们必须修理索具。他们必须掌舵。他们必须维护好这艘船——他们的身心——的状态。</p>
<p>Here their responsibility ends, for they are not responsible for the journey. They are not responsible for their destiny. They are not responsible for their origin. And they are not responsible for creating the special cargo, the real contribution that they have on board the ship.</p>
<p>他们的责任到此为止，因为他们不负责旅程。他们不负责他们的天命。他们不负责他们的起源。他们也不负责创造他们在船上拥有的特殊货物和真正的贡献。</p>
<p>Think clearly here. Realize what great responsibility there is in managing and maintaining one’s own ship with wisdom and authority. This is a challenge that few in the world have ever met sufficiently. To maintain your ship as the captain of your ship so that your journey can be fulfilled is something that very few people have accomplished.</p>
<p>在这里清晰的思考。要意识到用智慧和权威来管理和维护自己的船是多么伟大的责任。这是世界上很少有人能够充分应对的挑战。作为船长的你，维护好你的船，让你的旅程顺利完成，这是很少有人能够做到的事情。</p>
<p>But it can be accomplished. It is given to you to accomplish. You must be on that ship. You must set sail. The Creator will guide the ship through the greater forces that affect you, but you must prepare your ship to sail. You must finally leave port and head out. You must manage your ship. You must maintain yourself. Here you exercise your authority continuously, and by doing so, you honor the Source of your authority.</p>
<p>但它能够实现。它被赋予你去实现。你必须在这艘船上。你必须扬帆起航。造物主将指引这艘船穿越那些影响你的更伟大驱动力，但你必须为你的船做好准备。你最终必须离开港口，启航。你必须管理你的船。你必须维护你自己。在这里，你持续地运用你的权威，并由此尊重你权威的源泉。</p>
<p>This is worshipping the Creator, not by falling down on your knees, not by offering endless requests for supplication, not by giving your want list, but by becoming responsible for your life so that your ship can make a greater journey and deliver its special cargo, its greater contribution in the world. Here you honor your reality, the reality of the Creator and the reality of all who dwell here.</p>
<p>这就是对造物主的崇拜，并非通过跪倒在地，并非通过无休止的祈求，并非通过列出你的愿望清单，而是通过对你的生命负责，这样你的飞船才能开启更伟大的旅程，运送它特殊的货物，为世界做出更伟大的贡献。在此，你尊崇你的实相，尊崇造物主的实相，尊崇所有栖居于此的众生的实相。</p>
<p>Right now the Unseen Ones, who are the Angels of the Creator, who are your true Teachers, are seeking to prepare your ship to sail. Perhaps you think you are sailing already, but you may be wandering around the harbor. You have not yet ventured into the open sea.</p>
<p>此刻，那些不可见者，那些造物主的天使，那些你的真正老师，正在努力为你的航船做好启航的准备。或许你认为你已经启航，但你可能还在港口附近徘徊。你还没有冒险驶入大海。</p>
<p>This is a different kind of journey than simply wandering around the world hoping or believing that someone or something is guiding you. This is a different kind of journey than simply experimenting with this or with that, or getting in and out of relationships, or trying out all kinds of spiritual teachings, or reading lots of books about spirituality or psychology.</p>
<p>这是一种截然不同的旅程，它不同于仅仅在世间徘徊，期盼或相信有人或事在指引你。这是一种截然不同的旅程，它不同于仅仅尝试这做那，或者开始或结束一段感情，或者尝试各种精神教导，或者阅读大量精神性或心理学书籍。</p>
<p>That is not sailing on the open sea. To sail on the open sea, your ship must be prepared. Your crew, which represents your primary thoughts, must be in harmony and must recognize and serve your authority. Your sails, which are your abilities, must be prepared. You must have all of your provisions. You must have your crew in order.</p>
<p>它并非在公海上航行。要在公海上航行，你的船必须做好准备。你的船员，代表着你的主要思想，必须和谐相处，必须承认并服从你的权威。你的船帆，代表着你的能力，必须做好准备。你必须准备好所有的补给。你必须让你的船员井然有序。</p>
<p>Everything must be prepared, for this is not a reckless journey. This is not a journey of will, wish and impulse. This is not a journey you take thinking that nothing bad can happen to you and that everything will be taken care of for you, because you cannot take this journey if you are in a state of welfare or have a welfare mentality regarding your relationship with the Divine.</p>
<p>一切都必须做好准备，因为这不是一场鲁莽的旅程。这不是一场意志、希望和冲动的旅程。这不是一场你认为不会有坏事发生在你身上、一切都会得到妥善安排的旅程，因为如果你处于一种幸福的状态，或者对你与神性的关系抱有幸福的心态，你就无法踏上这段旅程。</p>
<p>Here instead, the Divine is entrusting you to carry out the mission, to take a greater journey in life. Instead of you thinking the Creator is going to do everything for you and provide every opportunity and rescue you from every problem or every challenge, you realize it is the other way around. And you say, “Oh, my gosh! What a responsibility! I am not sure I can do this!”</p>
<p>而在这里，神圣正托付你去完成使命，去踏上更伟大的生命旅程。你不再认为造物主会为你包办一切，提供一切机会，拯救你脱离一切困境或挑战，而是意识到事实恰恰相反。你会说：“哦，我的天哪！这责任多大啊！我不确定我能不能做到！”</p>
<p>But you can do this because Knowledge lives within you and because you have come into the world for a purpose. You have come into the world to engage with certain people to fulfill certain aspects of the Greater Plan. These are not yet known to you.</p>
<p>但你能做到这一点，因为内识生活在你的内在，因为你为了某个目的来到世界。你来到世界是为了与某些人参与，以实现更伟大计划的某些面向。这些你尚且未知。</p>
<p>Your thoughts about them cannot contain their reality, for you must make the journey to their fulfillment. You must find those special people. You must engage in those unique activities. You must venture into the open sea—beyond the harbor of your thoughts, beyond the harbor of social beliefs and conveniences. You must go while everyone else remains behind in disrepair or in an attempt to negotiate life without the real foundation of their authority.</p>
<p>你对他们的想法无法容纳他们的现实，因为你必须踏上通往他们圆满的旅程。你必须找到那些特别的人。你必须参与那些独特的活动。你必须冒险进入那片广阔的海洋——超越你思想的港湾，超越社会信仰和便利的港湾。你必须前行，而其他人则留在破败不堪的境地，或试图在没有他们权威的真正基础的情况下应对生命。</p>
<p>Here you set sail, looking back where everyone remains behind. For few can leave the port of personal security and personal belief. They are all bound there. They have ships, but they cannot sail them. They have crews, but the crews will not get on board. They have sails, but they cannot be repaired and made functional. They have provisions, but they cannot bring those provisions on to their vessel.</p>
<p>你在此扬帆起航，回首望去，所有人都留在身后。因为很少有人能离开个人安全和个人信仰的港口。他们都被送往那里。他们有船，却无法驾驶。他们有船员，却不愿登船。他们有船帆，却无法修复，无法正常使用。他们有补给，却无法将这些补给带上他们的船。</p>
<p>They are in disarray. Judge them not, for you have lived there yourself. Now you are learning how much strength and courage it takes to become the captain of your ship, to rebuild your ship, to prepare your ship and to gain the provisions and the crew that are necessary.</p>
<p>他们一片混乱。不要评判他们，因为你自己也曾在那里生活过。现在你正在体会，要成为你的船长，重建你的船，准备你的船，并获得必要的补给和船员，需要多大的力量和勇气。</p>
<p>It is by exercising authority that you will have compassion for those who cannot or will not, for you will see that it is a great challenge. But it is this great challenge that you so need. You so need this to find your strength, to become a man or a woman of Knowledge, to become a person who has a greater mission and destiny in life.</p>
<p>通过行使权威，你将对那些不能或不愿这样做的人抱有同情心，因为你将看到这是一个伟大的挑战。但正是这个伟大的挑战才是你如此需要的。你如此需要它来找到你的力量，成为一个拥有内识的男人或女人，成为一个在生命中拥有更伟大使命和天命的人。</p>
<p>You cannot take the easy way, the comfortable way. You cannot stay with popular ideas or self-comforting notions. You cannot stand around all day saying pretty things to yourself, reassuring yourself, excusing yourself from error, avoiding difficulty and unpleasantness.</p>
<p>你不能走轻松的路，走舒服的路。你不能固守流行的想法或自我安慰的观念。你不能整天站在那里，对你自己说些漂亮话，安慰你自己，为你自己的错误找借口，逃避困难和不愉快的事情。</p>
<p>The people who are left behind in the harbor are all waiting for someone else to do it for them. They want to be the crew, not the captain. They do not want to have to do so much. But they expect that they will be great and have a great deal. They want something for nothing. They want their purpose, their meaning, their direction and their destiny revealed to them, but they will not make the journey where these things become apparent and self-evident. They will not exercise their real authority.</p>
<p>那些留在港口的人们都在等待别人来替他们做事。他们想成为船员，而不是船长。他们不想做那么多。但他们期望他们会变得伟大，拥有很多。他们想要不劳而获。他们想要他们的目的、他们的意义、他们的方向和他们的天命被揭示，但他们不愿踏上旅程，让这些变得显而易见、不证自明。他们不愿行使他们真正的权威。</p>
<p>Have compassion. Do not condemn them. For when you see how difficult it is and how life giving it is to reclaim this primary, essential authority, you will understand, and you will try to help others find this authority over time. But first you must claim it for yourself, and you must exercise it sufficiently so that your ship can prepare to leave the harbor.</p>
<p>要有同情心。不要谴责他们。因为当你看到重新获得这首要的、至关重要的权威有多么困难，又有多么赋予生命时，你就会理解，并且会努力帮助他人随着时间的推移找到这权威。但首先你必须为你自己争取到它，并且你必须充分运用它，这样你的船才能准备好离开港口。</p>
<p>People here may say, “Oh, my gosh! I cannot take such a journey alone. It would be too much for me!” You will not take this journey alone. The Unseen Ones will abide with you. And your ship will join with other ships. And you will find your direction. If you stay in the harbor and try to figure it out, plan it out or assume what it might be, you will never know. You will never find it.</p>
<p>这里的人们可能会说：“哦，我的天哪！我无法独自踏上这样的旅程。这对我来说太难以承受了！”你不会独自踏上这段旅程。不可见者将与你同在。你的船将与其他船汇合。你将找到你的方向。如果你留在港口，试图弄清楚它、计划它或假设它会是什么，你永远不会知道。你永远找不到它。</p>
<p>You must make the journey. Then you will know what the journey is. Then you will know what you are seeking. Then you will know what you must accomplish.</p>
<p>你必须踏上旅程。然后你才会知道旅程是什么。然后你才会知道你在追寻什么。然后你才会知道你必须完成什么。</p>
<p>Here you must be willing to be a beginner, for you are a beginner. Everyone is a beginner in The Way of Knowledge, regardless of what they believe or think that they have done or accomplished. Everyone is a beginning student of Knowledge because you must be a beginner to start.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须愿意成为一名初学者，因为你就是一位初学者。在内识之路上，每个人都是初学者，无论他们相信什么，或认为他们做过什么或成就了什么。每个人都是内识的初级学生，因为你必须是一位初学者才能开始。</p>
<p>If you think you know already, if you think you understand already, and you place this much credence in your own ideas and assumptions, then you will never leave the harbor. You will not even get on board your own ship. You will make the journey in your mind, but not in reality.</p>
<p>如果你认为你已经知道，如果你认为你已经理解，并且如此相信你自己的想法和假设，那么你将永远无法离开港口。你甚至无法登上你自己的船。你将在心灵中踏上旅程，却无法在现实中前行。</p>
<p>In the study of The Way of Knowledge, people are encouraged to exercise their authority at every step—not the authority of their will, not the authority of their wishes, or their ambitions, but the authority of Knowledge itself.</p>
<p>在学习内识之路的过程中，鼓励人们在每一步中运用他们的权威——不是他们意志的权威，不是他们愿望的权威，也不是他们野心的权威，而是内识本身的权威。</p>
<p>To read the Wisdom books, you are exercising your authority. Even if you think that they will give you something, you will exercise this authority because you are turning in the right direction. Even if you think that they will fulfill your ambitions and give you wealth, abundance, love, relationship, happiness; even if you have a welfare mentality, you are still turning in the right direction.</p>
<p>阅读智慧书籍，你就是在运用你的权威。即使你认为它们会给你带来什么，你也会运用这份权威，因为你正朝着正确的方向前进。即使你认为它们会满足你的野心，给你财富、富足、爱、关系和幸福；即使你抱有福利心态，你仍然在朝着正确的方向前进。</p>
<p>When you make a journey, when you are out on the water, you must be heading in the right direction. Do not think that any direction you go is going to take you to your destination. People who are wandering around the harbor make this assumption. They think, “Well, everyone will find their destiny. We are all right where we need to be!” But they are going nowhere, at great expense, at great effort.</p>
<p>当你踏上旅程，当你在水上航行时，你必须朝着正确的方向前进。不要认为你选择的任何方向都能带你到达目的地。那些在港口附近徘徊的人会这样想。他们想：“好吧，每个人都会找到他们的天命。我们都在我们应该去的地方！” 但他们却一无所获，付出了巨大的代价和努力。</p>
<p>You must have the right direction. When you read the Wisdom books, you are heading in the right direction. When you decide to begin the study of Steps to Knowledge, even if you think it will give to you everything you want, even if you are still waiting for the free gift from the Divine, you are still turning in the right direction.</p>
<p>你必须拥有正确的方向。当你阅读智慧书籍时，你就在朝着正确的方向前进。当你决定开始学习内识进阶时，即使你认为它会给予你想要的一切，即使你仍在等待来自神圣的自由礼物，你仍然在朝着正确的方向前进。</p>
<p>Knowledge knows that your motives are not yet pure. Knowledge knows that you are still encumbered and burdened with the belief that you must fulfill all of your ambitions to be happy. Knowledge knows that you are so burdened, but it will unburden you. It will liberate you. It will take you from being a miserable servant to being the captain of your ship. And it will do this without instilling in you any sense of arrogance because when you are the captain of your ship, you will realize that you rely upon Knowledge and that you are a part of something that transcends your understanding. Then you will be reverent, you will be humble, but you will be strong.</p>
<p>内识知道你的动机尚不纯粹。内识知道你依然被“你必须实现你所有的野心才能获得幸福”这个信念所束缚和重负。内识知道你如此沉重，但它将卸下你的重担。它将解放你。它将带你从一个悲惨的仆人变成你这艘船的船长。而且它这样做不会在你心中灌输任何傲慢感，因为当你成为你这艘船的船长时，你将意识到你依赖内识，你是某种超越你理解的事物的一部分。那时你将虔敬，你将谦逊，但你将强大。</p>
<p>Upon this, the Creator can bestow upon you your mission in life. But this cannot be bestowed upon you until you are ready. And to prepare you, the Creator has given Steps to Knowledge and the Books of Wisdom.</p>
<p>在此基础上，造物主可以赋予你生命的使命。但这只有在你准备好之后才能被赋予。为了让你做好准备，造物主赐予了通往内识的阶梯和智慧之书。</p>
<p>Every Step that you take in Steps to Knowledge, every practice that you undertake, is an act of exercising your authority. It is through exercising this authority that you will realize your strength, that you will realize the source of your strength, that you will see that you are not simply fulfilling your wishes or your ambitions.</p>
<p>你在内识进阶中迈出的每一个步骤，你开展的每一个修行，都是在运用你的权威。正是通过运用这个权威，你将认识到你的力量，你将认识到你力量的源泉，你将看到你并非只是在满足你的愿望或你的野心。</p>
<p>You will see that you are honoring something that is great, greater even than the world—something that is free in the world, that cannot be dominated or manipulated by the wishes or the will of others, or even by the machinations of governments or even by anyone in the Greater Community of worlds.</p>
<p>你将看到你正在尊崇某种伟大的事情，甚至比世界更伟大——某种在世界上自由的事物，某种无法被他人的愿望或意志，甚至无法被政府的阴谋，甚至无法被大社区世界里的任何生命所支配或操控的事物。</p>
<p>Such an authority is within you. But you must exercise it to realize it. You cannot simply believe in it or make grand assumptions about it or hope that it will do everything for you and that you can wander through life like a helpless little child.</p>
<p>这种权威就在你内心。但你必须运用它才能真正实现它。你不能简单地相信它，或对它做出宏大的假设，或指望它能为你包办一切，让你像个无助的小孩一样漫无目的地度过一生。</p>
<p>No, you must take charge of your affairs. You must organize your thinking. You must begin to face the Four Pillars of your life—the Pillar of Relationships, the Pillar of Work, the Pillar of Health and the Pillar of Your Spiritual Development. For these are part of your responsibilities.</p>
<p>不，你必须掌控你的事务。你必须整理你的思维。你必须开始面对你生命的四大支柱——关系支柱、工作支柱、健康支柱以及你的精神发展支柱。因为这些都是你责任的一部分。</p>
<p>To set sail on the open water, you must have relationships that support you and that are in harmony with your greater mission. Your work must support your ability to be a student. And you must be able to exercise wisdom in your decisions there. You must have sufficient mental and physical health to undergo such a journey. And you must be preparing in The Way of Knowledge in order to advance your spiritual development in a real and genuine way.</p>
<p>为了扬帆远航，你必须拥有支持你并与你更伟大使命和谐相处的关系。你的工作必须支持你作为一名学生的能力。你必须能够在你的决定中运用智慧。你必须拥有充足的身心健康来经历这样的旅程。你必须在内识之路上进行准备，以便以一种真实而真诚的方式推进你的精神发展。</p>
<p>Developing these Pillars is not something that is done all at once. It is done step by step, and each step you take, you exercise this authority. And every time you exercise this, this authority becomes a little stronger, a little more revealing of its reality and nature.</p>
<p>发展这些支柱并非一蹴而就。它是一步一步进行的，你迈出的每一步，你都在运用这个权威。而每一次你运用它，这个权威都会变得更加强大，更加揭示它的现实和自然。</p>
<p>Here your ability and your deeper inclinations become revealed to you, and you learn to accept them and to utilize them effectively and appropriately. Here you recognize the risks and dangers of making false assumptions, of becoming impatient and trying to rush ahead, of trying to fill in the gaps in your understanding with your own preferred ideas.</p>
<p>在这里，你的能力和你更深层次的倾向被揭示给你，你学习接受它们，并有效且恰当地运用它们。在这里，你认出做出错误假设、变得不耐烦并试图仓促前进、试图用你自己偏好的想法填补你理解的空白的风险和危险。</p>
<p>Instead, you learn to become patient. You learn forbearance. You learn to allow your comprehension, your understanding, to be incomplete because it is incomplete.</p>
<p>相反，你要学会耐心。你要学会忍耐。你要学会允许你的理解、你的领悟不完整，因为它本来就不完整。</p>
<p>Here you make friends with the unknown and learn to live with the mystery of your life, whereas before you could not tolerate uncertainty. Everything had to be defined. Everything had to be organized. You filled in all the spaces with conventional ideas and convenient beliefs. It was upon this false understanding that you based your sense of certainty and your identity.</p>
<p>在这里，你与未知结为朋友，学会与生命的神秘共存，而在此之前，你无法忍受不确定性。一切都必须被定义。一切都必须被组织。你用传统的想法和便捷的信念填满了所有的空白。正是基于这种错误的理解，你建立了你的确定感和身份认同。</p>
<p>But these have failed you, for they could only fail you. Now you turn to the greater authority, the greater identity that lives within you and that has been awaiting your arrival for so long.</p>
<p>但这些都辜负了你，因为它们只能辜负你。现在，你转向更伟大的权威，那存在于你内在、等待你到来已久的更伟大的身份。</p>
<p>You follow the Steps to Knowledge. You utilize your practice. You learn to work in the Four Pillars of your life, bringing Knowledge into your decision making, appealing to Knowledge in others, building strong relationships that can embody Knowledge and stepping away from those that deny Knowledge or that cannot support Knowledge.</p>
<p>你遵循内识进阶。你善用你的练习。你学习在你生命的四大支柱中工作，将内识带入你的决策，呼吁他人内在的内识，构建能够体现内识的强大关系，并远离那些否认内识或无法支持内识的人。</p>
<p>Here you are preparing your ship to sail, for on this journey you can only take what is essential and necessary for the mission itself. You cannot take everyone you love, you cannot take everything you like, you cannot take all the things that you believe in, you cannot take all of your memories—for your ship will not hold them, and they cannot support your mission. You can only take with you those things—those ideas, those memories, those attitudes, those beliefs, those possessions, those activities, and those relationships—that can journey with you.</p>
<p>在这里，你正在准备你的船启航，因为在这个旅程中，你只能带上对使命本身至关重要和必要的东西。你无法带上你爱的每个人，你无法带上你喜欢的一切，你无法带上你信仰的所有事物，你无法带上你所有的记忆——因为你的船无法容纳它们，它们无法支持你的使命。你只能带上那些能够与你同行的东西——那些想法，那些记忆，那些态度，那些信仰，那些所有物，那些活动，以及那些关系。</p>
<p>As I speak, you can begin to see how much you must exercise your authority and to what degree you must recognize this authority and distinguish it from the other impulses in your mind.</p>
<p>当我说话的时候，你就可以开始看到你必须在多大程度上行使你的权威，以及你必须在多大程度上承认这种权威，并将其与你心灵中的其他冲动区分开来。</p>
<p>Here you can see that you must develop a real foundation for certainty within yourself, a commitment to life. Here you must let certain things fall away. Here you must make fundamental and consequential decisions. Here you must honor what is known instead of being a servant to what is wanted.</p>
<p>在这里你可以看到，你必须在你内在发展一个真正的确定性基础，一种对生命的承诺。在这里，你必须放下某些事物。在这里，你必须做出根本性的、重要的决定。在这里，你必须尊重已知的内识，而非成为被渴望之物的奴仆。</p>
<p>This authority will restore to you your power and your ability. It will reveal to you over time your true capabilities. It will bring to you those relationships that are essential for your development and for the fulfillment of your mission. It will clear the way for you. It will make you strong. It will give you your authority.</p>
<p>这种权威将恢复你的力量和能力。随着时间的推移，它将向你揭示你真正的能力。它将为你带来那些对你的发展和完成你的使命至关重要的关系。它将为你扫清道路。它将使你变得强大。它将赋予你权威。</p>
<p>Then your thoughts, which represent the crew on your ship, will obey you. They will follow you. They will serve you—because you are the authority to follow, because you can exercise power, because you can command that which is given you to command, which is your thoughts, your activities and your affairs.</p>
<p>那么，你的思想，代表着你船上的船员，将会服从你。它们将会追随你。它们将会服务于你——因为你是被追随的权威，因为你可以运用权力，因为你可以指挥那些被赋予你指挥的事物，也就是你的思想、你的活动和你的事务。</p>
<p>You must become a man or a woman of Knowledge. Nothing less. You will find what a greater challenge and accomplishment this is. And you will find what gifts it will enable you to give to others.</p>
<p>你必须成为一个拥有内识的男人或女人。一点儿也不例外。你会发现这是一个多么伟大的挑战和成就。你也会发现它能让你给予他人什么样的礼物。</p>
<p>And every step along the way, you will have to exercise your authority. You will have to give up a welfare mentality. You will have to give up so many assumptions, many of which are popular. You will have to open your mind and let your mind become empty. You will have to live life very cleanly, very efficiently, very consciously.</p>
<p>一路走来，你每一步都必须运用你的权威。你必须放弃福利心态。你必须放弃很多假设，其中很多都很流行。你必须打开你的心灵，让你的心灵清空。你必须过着非常干净、非常高效、非常自觉的生活。</p>
<p>But is this not what you really want? Can you settle for less than this? Can you remain in the harbor and find any sense of fulfillment there? You have been in this harbor long enough. You have wandered around the harbor. Your ship has been out of the water. You can see the disarray around you there.</p>
<p>但这难道不是你真正想要的吗？你能安于现状吗？你能留在港湾里，找到任何满足感吗？你在这个港湾里待得够久了。你在港湾里徘徊了很久。你的船已经驶离了水面。你能看到周围的一片混乱。</p>
<p>You can look out and see the open sea is awaiting you, calling to you. You can feel this calling within yourself. And you can feel your restlessness and realize that you cannot stay where you are, for you have people to meet and places to go, and you must go there.</p>
<p>你可以放眼望去，看到浩瀚的大海正在等待你，召唤你。你可以在内心感受到这召唤。你可以感受到你的躁动，并意识到你不能停留在原地，因为你要见人，要去地方，你必须去那里。</p>
<p>You cannot immerse yourself in pleasures or comforts or luxuries because that is not why you came to the world. You cannot settle for what seems to satisfy everyone else because you have a mission, and those who sent you here are calling you to remind you that you have a mission and that you must take the Steps to Knowledge to find this mission and to have the strength and the authority to fulfill it.</p>
<p>你不能沉溺于享乐、舒适或奢华，因为那不是你来到这个世界的原因。你不能满足于看似让所有人满意的事物，因为你肩负着一个使命，那些派遣你来到这里的存在正在召唤你，提醒你，你肩负着一个使命，你必须开展内识进阶来发现这个使命，并拥有成就它的力量和权威。</p>
<p>Come then to the real authority, not with trepidation but with relief and with courage and with the willingness to discover its reality and to exercise its strength.</p>
<p>那么，走向真正的权威吧，不要心存恐惧，而是要带着解脱和勇气，带着发现权威的现实和运用权威的力量的意愿。</p>
<p>Come as a beginner, realizing you must learn what this authority is and how it can be expressed with wisdom.</p>
<p>作为初学者，您必须学习这种权威是什么以及如何用智慧表达它。</p>
<p>Come understanding you must leave behind your old ideas, your old assumptions and old definitions because you will not need them now, for you have found the real authority in your life. It is this authority that you must utilize on your own behalf to find your true integrity and to remember to reclaim the gifts that you have brought with you from your Ancient Home to bestow upon the world.</p>
<p>你必须抛弃你旧的想法、旧的假设和旧的定义来理解，因为你现在不再需要它们，因为你已经找到了你生命中真正的权威。正是这个权威，你必须为了你自己去善用，去发现你真正的完整性，并记住重新唤回你从你的古老家园带来的、并给予世界的礼物。</p>
