<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on January 9, 2009 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2009 年 1 月 9 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have two fundamental aspects to your nature. You have a personal mind, which is associated with your body, a mind that has been conditioned by your cultures, your society, your families and by nature itself. This mind is driven by the need for survival. It is driven by the need for security and for resources. It is fundamentally fearful because it is so very aware of the risks and the prospect of loss in the future. It is haunted by this prospect of loss, and it is governed by the need to offset these risks.</p>
<p>你的自然有两个基本面向。你拥有一个与你的身体相连的个人心灵，这个心灵受到你的文化、你的社会、你的家庭以及自然本身的制约。这个心灵受生存需求的驱使。它受安全感和资源需求的驱使。它从根本上感到恐惧，因为它非常清楚未来的风险和损失的前景。它被这种损失的前景所困扰，并被抵消这些风险的需求所支配。</p>
<p>There is the fear of social alienation. There is the fear of political oppression. There is the fear of abject poverty. There is the fear of illness in all of its manifestations. There is the fear of being attacked by others. There is the fear of losing your loved ones, losing your home and losing your source of income. There is the fear of nature and the power of nature, and what it can do to devastate one’s life. There is the fear of other peoples and their intentions. There is the fear of war. There is the fear of pestilence. There is the fear of death. There is the fear of death for those you care about and love.</p>
<p>有对社会疏离的恐惧。有对政治压迫的恐惧。有对赤贫的恐惧。有对各种疾病表现的恐惧。有对被他人袭击的恐惧。有对失去亲人、失去家园和失去收入来源的恐惧。有对自然以及自然力量的恐惧，以及自然如何摧毁一个人生命的恐惧。有对其他民族及其意图的恐惧。有对战争的恐惧。有对瘟疫的恐惧。有对死亡的恐惧。有对你所关心和所爱之人的死亡的恐惧。</p>
<p>The list could go on and on specifically, but you can see here that if one is not falsely insulated by assurances and wealth that the risks and the hazards of life are quite considerable. And if one is being honest with oneself, one would have to face these risks and consider them, and to learn how to navigate the hazards and the uncertainties of life with as much skill and awareness as one could muster.</p>
<p>这个清单可以列得很长，但你可以看到，如果一个人没有被虚假的保障和财富所保护，那么生命中的风险和危险是相当巨大的。如果一个人对自己诚实，他就必须面对这些风险，认真考虑它们，并学习如何运用尽可能多的技能和觉知来应对生命中的危险和不确定性。</p>
<p>People seek relief, of course, from all of this concern and anxiety. They believe in groups and nations. They identify with causes and political persuasions. They identify with religions and religious prejudices. They condemn others to strengthen themselves. They belittle other races of people or nations of people to give themselves a greater sense of power and assurance. They lose themselves in fantasies.</p>
<p>当然，人们寻求从所有这些担忧和焦虑中解脱出来。他们相信群体和国家。他们认同某些事业和政治主张。他们认同宗教和宗教偏见。他们谴责他人以增强自身力量。他们贬低其他种族或国家的人，以增强他们自己的权力感和自信。他们迷失在幻想中。</p>
<p>If they live in wealthy nations, perhaps they lose themselves in hobbies or obsessions. Unwilling or unable to face the realities of life, they seek escape. And they seek various forms of reinforcement for themselves.</p>
<p>如果他们生活在富裕国家，或许会沉迷于各种爱好或痴迷。他们不愿或无力面对现实，于是寻求逃避。他们也寻求各种形式的自我强化。</p>
<p>This is the condition of your personal mind, a mind that is concerned with survival, security and gratification. This is not evil in any sense. It is simply the [province] of the personal mind. Because the personal mind is so very insecure, it seeks for escape in its indulgences, its pleasures, its ideas or its activities.</p>
<p>这就是你个人心灵的状态，一个关心生存、安全和满足的心灵。这绝不是邪恶。这仅仅是个人心灵的范畴。因为个人心灵如此缺乏安全感，它才会在它的放纵、它的快乐、它的想法或它的活动中寻求逃避。</p>
<p>These of course become quite aberrant, even self-destructive to the individual. So it would be accurate to say that fundamentally your personal mind is fear based because it is given the challenge and the difficult task of navigating a hazardous and uncertain world.</p>
<p>这些当然会变得相当异常，甚至对个人而言具有自我毁灭性。因此，准确地说，从根本上来说，你的个人心灵是基于恐惧的，因为它面临着挑战，面临着在一个充满危险和不确定性的世界中航行的艰巨任务。</p>
<p>But there is a greater Intelligence within you that is not the product of your biological or social nature. This Intelligence was created by God, and God has given you this Intelligence to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to your greater work and service in the world.</p>
<p>可是你内在有一个更伟大的智能，它并非你生物性或社会性自然的产物。这个智能是由上帝创造的，上帝赋予你这个智能来指引你、保护你并引领你走向你在世界上更伟大的工作和服务。</p>
<p>It is a very different kind of Intelligence than your personal mind. It has not been conditioned by your family, your culture or your friends. It is not subject to political beliefs or persuasions or religious ideology. It is not threatened by the world. It is only limited in its expression by the world.</p>
<p>它是一种与你的个人心灵截然不同的智能。它不受你的家庭、你的文化或你的朋友的制约。它不受政治信仰、说服或宗教意识形态的支配。它不受世界的威胁。它只是在表达上受到世界的限制。</p>
<p>Its purpose here is a higher purpose, a purpose aimed at service and contribution in the world. This greater Intelligence is called Knowledge because it is related to your ability to inexplicably know things that are beyond the abilities and the capacity of the intellect.</p>
<p>它在这里的目的是为了一个更高宗旨，一个旨在服务和贡献于世界的目的。这个更伟大的智能被称为内识，因为它与你以难以言喻的方式知道超越智力能力和容量的事物的能力相关。</p>
<p>The fact that humanity has not developed its connection to this greater Intelligence to any significant degree is a measure of humanity’s evolution overall and the kind of skills, wisdom and ability that humanity has yet to garner for itself, for its own survival and protection.</p>
<p>人类尚未与这种更伟大智能建立起任何显著的联系，这个事实是人类整体进化的一个衡量标准，也是人类尚未为它自己、为它自身的生存和保护而积累的技能、智慧和能力的一个衡量标准。</p>
<p>Knowledge is here to guide the intellect. It is not merely a resource for the intellect. It is a far wiser guide, regarding your survival and well-being, than your ideas or the ideas of others. Knowledge is guided by love, but it is a love focused on service and on responsibilities.</p>
<p>内识在此指引着智力。它不仅仅是智力的资源。对于你的生存和福祉，它远比你的想法或他人的想法更睿智。内识由爱引导，但这种爱专注于服务和责任。</p>
<p>It is essentially fearless. Yet even being fearless, it has concerns. It has concerns for your well-being, your survival, your state of mind and your circumstances.</p>
<p>它本质上是无所畏惧的。然而，即使无所畏惧，它也有顾虑。它关心你的福祉、你的生存、你的心灵状态以及你的处境。</p>
<p>For your greater purpose in life will not emerge under any circumstances [but] must have the proper attitude and motivation within you for this emergence to take place. Giving you the right motivation, the right approach, the right attitude and the right circumstances is the concern of Knowledge.</p>
<p>因为你生命中更伟大的目的不会在任何情况下出现，而是必须拥有你内在的正确态度和动机，才能让这种出现发生。赋予你正确的动机、正确的途径、正确的态度和正确的境遇，是内识所关注的。</p>
<p>Knowledge must guide you and put you in a position with a clarity of mind where you can see clearly and experience directly the greater life you are here to live and give you clues as to the greater service you are here to perform.</p>
<p>内识必须引导你，让你处于心灵清晰的位置，让你能够清楚地看到并直接体验你在此生活的更伟大生命，并为你提供线索，告诉你你在此要履行的更伟大服务。</p>
<p>Clearly, it would be wise for that which is fearful to follow that which is fearless. But your personal mind has its own domain of responsibilities. It must feed and care for the needs of the body. It must establish you as a functioning member of society. It must cultivate communication skills and survival abilities. It must give you healthy and responsible tasks to fulfill. It must give you a vocation of some kind in the world so that you can support yourself and other people.</p>
<p>显然，让恐惧的心灵追随无畏的内识是明智的。但你的个人心灵有它自己的责任领域。它必须滋养和照顾身体的需要。它必须将你确立为社会中一个正常运转的成员。它必须培养沟通技巧和生存能力。它必须赋予你健康而负责任的任务去完成。它必须赋予你在世间某种职业，这样你才能养活你自己和他人。</p>
<p>Here you do not abandon your personal mind because you cannot communicate in the world effectively without it. It is a vehicle of communication, as is your body. Yet it must be focused and oriented correctly, and its responsibilities must be recognized and attended to.</p>
<p>在这里，你不会放弃你的个人心灵，因为没有它你无法在世界上有效地沟通。它是一个沟通的载体，就像你的身体一样。然而它必须被正确聚焦和引导，它的责任必须被认知和关注。</p>
<p>Here you cannot neglect your responsibilities as a member of society, or if you are a parent, your responsibility to your children, because you are seeking a spiritual path. Some people try to use spirituality as a kind of escape from all things that are weighing upon them. They seek bliss, happiness and peace. They try to run away from their life. And of course this cannot be successful, for even if you were to attain these things, Knowledge would bring you back into the world with all of its hazards and difficulties.</p>
<p>在这里，你不能忽视你作为社会成员的责任，或者如果你是一位父母，你对孩子的责任，因为你正在寻求一条精神之路。有些人试图利用精神性来逃避所有压在他们身上的事物。他们寻求喜乐、幸福与和平。他们试图逃离他们的生命。当然，这不可能成功，因为即使你获得了这些，内识也会把你带回这个世界，带着它所有的危险和困难。</p>
<p>You are not here to find an escape from the world. You are here to serve the world in a specific way, in specific places, with certain people.</p>
<p>你来到这个世界不是为了逃避这个世界。你来到这个世界是为了以一种特定的方式，在特定的地方，与特定的人一起服务这个世界。</p>
<p>You can try to run away from yourself, but you really cannot divorce yourself from Knowledge, for it goes everywhere with you, being the greater part of you. Here you cannot say, “Well, I will just live in a state of Knowledge all the time,” because you still have responsibilities. You still have to provide for yourself and others. Ultimately, you have a greater service to others, which may bring to you even more worldly responsibilities.</p>
<p>你可以试图逃离你自己，但你真的无法让你自己脱离内识，因为它无处不在，它是你更伟大的部分。在这里，你不能说：“好吧，我将一直生活在内识状态中”，因为你仍然有责任。你仍然必须为你自己和他人提供。最终，你对他人有一个更伟大的服务，这可能会给你带来更多的世俗责任。</p>
<p>So that which is fearful cannot be abandoned, but it must be wisely guided. That is why God has given you the power of Knowledge. God is not going to guide you. The Lord of all the universes is not going to become preoccupied with your affairs and daily experiences. That is why God has put Knowledge within you, to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to your greater accomplishments.</p>
<p>因此，那令人恐惧的事物无法被抛弃，而必须被明智地引导。正因如此，上帝赋予了你内识的力量。上帝不会引导你。所有宇宙的主宰不会沉迷于你的事务和日常体验。正因如此，上帝将内识置于你的内在，来指引你，保护你，并引领你走向更伟大的成就。</p>
<p>That which is fearless must guide that which is fearful. That which is great must guide that which is small. That which is strong and wise must guide that which is weak and fallible.</p>
<p>无畏者必引导畏惧者。伟大必须引导渺小。强大而睿智的心灵必引导软弱而易犯错的心灵。</p>
<p>This is what brings together all aspects of yourself into a working and harmonious whole. This is what establishes your fundamental integrity and your deeper experience of yourself. This is what restores to you self-confidence, self-love and the ability to experience affinity with others. This is the antidote to hatred, to malice, to greed, to obsession, to addiction and the need for revenge.</p>
<p>正是它，将你自己的所有面向整合成一个有效和谐的整体。正是它，确立了你根本的完整性，以及你对你自己的更深层次体验。正是它，让你重拾自信、自爱，以及体验与他人亲和力的能力。正是它，是仇恨、恶意、贪婪、执念、成瘾和复仇欲望的解药。</p>
<p>In this way, God has placed a perfect guiding Intelligence within you. But for you to find this guidance and to receive its redemption, you must learn to gain access to Knowledge, to take the Steps to Knowledge and to learn how to follow Knowledge within the real circumstances of your life.</p>
<p>在这种方式中，上帝将一个完美的指引智能置于你的内在。但为了让你找到这个指引并接收它的救赎，你必须学习走向内识，开展内识进阶，并学习如何在你生命的真实境况里遵循内识。</p>
<p>Here instead of abdicating your responsibility, you find yourself having to take on greater responsibilities. Now you must manage not only your affairs, but your emotions, your relationships with others, your attitudes, your perception—everything. Here there is no giving over your responsibilities so you can be happy, careless and irresponsible.</p>
<p>在这里，你发现你非但不能放弃责任，反而必须承担一种更伟大的责任。现在你不仅要管理好你的事务，还要管理好你的情绪、你与他人的关系、你的态度、你的感知——一切。在这里，你不会为了快乐、漫不经心和不负责任而放弃你的责任。</p>
<p>Indeed, Knowledge requires you to be captain of your ship. For Knowledge will not govern your daily affairs. Knowledge is not here to manage you every moment of the day. Knowledge is not there to help you choose from the menu of life what you will consume, unless these decisions have great consequence.</p>
<p>事实上，内识要求你成为你这艘船的船长。因为内识不会掌管你的日常事务。内识并非时刻掌控你。内识并非帮助你从生命菜单中选择你要消费什么，除非这些决定具有伟大影响。</p>
<p>Knowledge sets the direction, the goal and gives you the strength to follow this direction and to recognize and experience the goal. It is like Knowledge is the monarch and your mind is the civil servant. The monarch is not going to give up its greater responsibilities to come down and take care of fundamental matters on the ground. That is the role of the civil servant, you see.</p>
<p>内识设定方向、目标，并赋予你力量去追随这个方向，去认知和体验这个目标。就好像内识是君主，而你的心灵是公务员。君主不会放弃它更伟大的责任，亲自下凡处理基层事务。你看，这就是公务员的职责。</p>
<p>So this approach requires a clear understanding of what your body needs, what your mind needs, and what your soul needs—the hierarchy of needs within you and within other people. This of course takes time to develop because when you begin this great journey towards Knowledge, your whole sense of proportion is incorrect.</p>
<p>因此，这种方法需要清晰地理解你的身体需要什么，你的心灵需要什么，你的灵魂需要什么——你内在以及他人内在的需求层级。这当然需要时间来培养，因为当你开始这段通往内识的伟大旅程时，你的整个比例感都是错误的。</p>
<p>Most people begin thinking Spirit is a kind of resource for the mind and the mind is a slave to the body. They have the whole relationship confused and out of order. So it takes time to bring things into a correct and functioning understanding.</p>
<p>大多数人一开始就认为精神是心灵的一种资源，而心灵是身体的奴隶。他们把精神与身体的关系弄得混乱不堪，毫无秩序。因此，需要时间才能让这些概念得到正确且有效的理解。</p>
<p>Of course, along the way people make wild and ridiculous assumptions and conclusions. That is because the personal mind is trying to understand the universe, trying to understand God, trying to understand destiny, purpose and meaning—all things that only can be realized at the level of Knowledge, which exists beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect. The intellect can be a major participant in the discovery of these greater things, but the realization happens beyond the realm of your ideas.</p>
<p>当然，一路上人们会做出疯狂而荒谬的假设和结论。那是因为个人心灵正在试图理解宇宙，试图理解上帝，试图理解天命、目的和意义——所有这些只有在内识的层面才能被领悟，而内识存在于智力的领域和范围之外。智力可以成为发现这些更伟大事物的主要参与者，但这种领悟发生在你的想法之外。</p>
<p>So day to day, you have a great responsibility to manage your awareness, your emotions, your attitudes, your affairs, your engagement with other people, your financial responsibilities, your health responsibilities, your relationship responsibilities and your responsibility to develop your spiritual awareness—which means fundamentally your connection with Knowledge.</p>
<p>因此日复一日，你肩负着伟大责任去管理你的觉知、你的情绪、你的态度、你的事务、你与他人的交往、你的财务责任、你的健康责任、你的关系责任以及你发展你的精神觉知的责任——这从根本上意味着你与内识的联接。</p>
<p>Here you have Four Pillars to your life: the Pillar of Health; the Pillar of Work and Providership; you have the Pillar of Relationships; and you have the Pillar of your Spiritual Development. Like the four legs of a table, they uphold your life, and your life is only as strong and stable as the weakest of your Pillars. So building your Pillars is a fundamental and necessary development. It represents the foundation of your life.</p>
<p>这里有你生命的四大支柱：健康支柱；工作与供养支柱；关系支柱；以及精神发展支柱。它们如同桌子的四条腿，支撑着你的生命，而你的生命之强弱，取决于你最薄弱的支柱。因此，构建你的支柱是一项根本且必要的发展。它代表着你生命的根基。</p>
<p>If your mind is really being guided by Knowledge, and you understand what your responsibilities are and the boundaries to your own personal awareness, then you will see the essential importance of developing these Pillars and maintaining them, not forfeiting the others to support one alone.</p>
<p>如果你的心灵真正受到内识的引导，并且你理解你的责任是什么以及你个人觉知的界限是什么，那么你就会看到发展这些支柱并维护它们的重要性，而不是为了单独支持一个而放弃其他支柱。</p>
<p>Many people become obsessed in one area of their life because they have neglected their other Pillars. Perhaps they are obsessed with relationships, with love and companionship. Perhaps they are obsessed with their health and the needs of the body. Perhaps they are obsessed with their work and their desire for wealth and financial power. Perhaps they are obsessed with their spiritual study or spiritual practice. Whatever the case, it is still the same problem.</p>
<p>许多人沉迷于生命的某个领域，是因为他们忽视了其他支柱。或许他们沉迷于人际关系、爱和陪伴。或许他们沉迷于健康和身体的需求。或许他们沉迷于工作以及对财富和金融权力的渴望。或许他们沉迷于精神学习或精神修行。无论如何，问题依然相同。</p>
<p>Obsession means that your life is out of balance and you are neglecting the Pillars of your life. Because if you were attending to all Four Pillars of your life, you would not have time to become obsessed. While it is true that at any given moment one Pillar may require more attention than the others, you will, in essence, have to maintain them all.</p>
<p>执着意味着你的生命失去了平衡，你忽视了你生命的四大支柱。因为如果你关注生命的四大支柱，你就没有时间沉迷其中了。虽然在任何时候，某个支柱可能比其他支柱更需要关注，但本质上，你必须同时维护所有支柱。</p>
<p>This is the perfect antidote to obsession and addiction because it takes a lot of time to develop and maintain the Pillars of your life and your worldly responsibilities. You do not have the luxury of falling into fantasy or obsession, or obsessive relationships, or obsessive work, or obsessive emphasis on your health and beauty, or dealing with illness itself. You do not have time.</p>
<p>这是对付痴迷和上瘾的完美解药，因为培养和维持你生命的支柱和世俗的责任需要花费大量时间。你没有时间沉溺于幻想或痴迷，沉溺于关系，沉溺于工作，沉溺于对健康和美貌的执着，或者沉溺于应对疾病本身。你没有时间。</p>
<p>Here time becomes precious, not to be wasted for anyone or anything. Here you see that your time is precious and you do not want to waste it. This makes you strong and responsible and builds character. Here you must dig deep within yourself to find the strength and the discipline to maintain the Four Pillars of your life. Here you understand that if you fail to do this, then any one of your Pillars can undermine your entire life.</p>
<p>在这里，时间变得宝贵，不该被浪费在任何人或任何事上。在这里，你看到你的时间是宝贵的，你不想浪费它。这让你变得强大、负责，并塑造你的品格。在这里，你必须深入内心，找到维系你生命四大支柱的力量和自律。在这里，你理解，如果你做不到这一点，那么你的任何一个支柱都可能毁掉你的整个生命。</p>
<p>You see the evidence of this all around you. People’s health collapses, and everything collapses with it. People have a history of failed relationships with a spouse or their children, and their whole life is spoiled by this lack of love, companionship and affinity. People never establish their Work Pillar, and so they are always facing financial hardship and immense stress. People lose themselves in their spiritual practice, and do not understand why they are suffering all the time, suffering because their other Pillars have not been established.</p>
<p>你周围随处可见这种现象的证据。人们的健康崩溃，一切都随之崩溃。人们与配偶或子女的关系往往失败，他们的一生都被这种爱、陪伴和亲和力的缺失所毁掉。人们从未建立起他们的工作支柱，因此他们总是面临经济困境和巨大的压力。人们沉迷于精神练习，不理解为什么他们总是受苦，因为他们的其他支柱尚未建立。</p>
<p>The evidence of this is everywhere. If you look at people without condemnation, they will teach you through demonstration the importance of Knowledge and the importance of building the Four Pillars of your life. With strong Pillars you become more secure in a changing world.</p>
<p>证据无处不在。如果你不带谴责地看待他人，他们就会通过示范教会你内识的重要性，以及构建你生命四大支柱的重要性。拥有强大的支柱，你就能在这个不断变化的世界中更加安全。</p>
<p>You have to spend less time shoring yourself up or fighting fires within your circumstances. You can weather storms and difficulties. You have the emotional strength to face and endure loss or misfortune. You have a solid anchor being in the world and cannot easily be swept away by the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>你不必再花时间去支撑你自己或应对困境。你可以安然度过风暴和困境。你拥有面对和承受损失或不幸的情感力量。你在这个世界上拥有坚实的支柱，不会轻易被变革的巨浪卷走。</p>
<p>While people are idling away their time in casual pursuits or personal hobbies, they are missing this opportunity to build a real foundation for themselves. They will need this foundation because you are facing a future where the Great Waves of change will alter the landscape of the world and where great upheaval and uncertainty will prevail.</p>
<p>当人们把时间浪费在休闲活动或个人爱好上时，他们就错过了为他们自己构建真正基础的机会。他们需要这个基础，因为你们正面临一个未来，在那里，变革的巨浪将改变世界的格局，在那里，巨大的动荡和不确定性将盛行。</p>
<p>Those who are reckless with their time, those who do not see the importance and the value of their life, will not fare well under these circumstances and there will be nothing there to rescue them. For they failed to prepare. They failed to build a real foundation for their lives.</p>
<p>那些不顾时间、不懂得生命重要性和价值的人，在这种情况下不会有好结果，也无力挽救他们。因为他们没有做好准备，没有为他们的生命打下真正的基础。</p>
<p>They never built the strength to do this. They never developed the discipline to do this. They never developed the courage to do this. And now they are lacking in strength and discipline and courage. They may pray to God for deliverance, but God has already given them the answer, an answer they have not heeded, an answer they have not followed.</p>
<p>他们从未拥有这样做的力量。他们从未培养这样做的纪律。他们从未培养这样做的勇气。如今，他们缺乏力量、纪律和勇气。他们或许会向上帝祈求拯救，但上帝早已给了他们答案，而这个答案他们却没有留意，也没有遵循。</p>
<p>This will be the plight of many people. This is the result of not responding to Knowledge and not building a real foundation for oneself. It is not enough to simply follow Knowledge at the level of inspiration alone. You must follow Knowledge in what it guides you to do and to establish and to build for yourself and for others.</p>
<p>这将是很多人的困境。这是没有回应内识、没有为自己构建真正基础的结果。仅仅在灵感层面遵循内识是不够的。你必须遵循内识，遵循它指引你去做什么、去确立什么、去构建什么，为了你自己和他人。</p>
<p>This, of course, requires a tremendous amount of work. While many people in the wealthy nations are trying to have ever greater leisure time, there is so much work to be done. To face the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world, you must build your ark. And it must be built strongly and wisely.</p>
<p>当然，这需要大量的工作。尽管富裕国家的许多人正在努力拥有越来越多的闲暇时间，但仍有太多的工作要做。为了面对即将降临世界的变革巨浪，你必须建造你的方舟。而且它必须建造得坚固而明智。</p>
<p>Otherwise, you will be overtaken by the changing circumstances of the world, and your life will be indeed very fearful, and that which is fearless will not be strong enough or evident enough in your awareness to counteract the immense fear and aggravation that your circumstances will produce.</p>
<p>否则，你将会被世界不断变化的环境所淹没，你的生命将会非常恐惧，而无所畏惧的内识在你的觉知中将不够强大或不够明显，无法抵消你所处的环境将产生的巨大恐惧和烦恼。</p>
<p>All living creatures in the world live for the moment, but also prepare for the future. That is why people build houses. That is why creatures build shelters and prepare for the seasons of life. To neglect this is to neglect such a fundamental responsibility, and spiritual practice and study cannot replace this responsibility. That is because you have Four Pillars to your life, and not just one.</p>
<p>世间万物生于当下，却又为未来做准备。正因如此，人们建造房屋。正因如此，万物建造庇护所，为生命的四季做好准备。忽视这一点，就等于忽视了如此根本的责任，而精神修行和学习无法取代这个责任。因为你的生命有四大支柱，而非仅仅一个。</p>
<p>Knowledge will lead you to develop a greater inner security and a greater outer security. It will lead you away from divisive relationships. It will lead you away from an unhealthy lifestyle. It will lead you away from people who are not responding to Knowledge and who are not building a real foundation for their life. It will bring into your life greater relationships, people who are strong and inspiring. And it will bring into your life circumstances that will demand of you a greater responsibility and self-discipline. It will strengthen you by requiring things of you and from you. It will engage your personal mind and all of its strengths and capabilities for a greater purpose—to establish a greater security and stability.</p>
<p>内识将引领你发展一种更伟大的内在安全感和一种更伟大的外在安全感。它将引领你远离分裂的关系。它将引领你远离一种不健康的生活方式。它将引领你远离那些没有回应内识、没有为他们的生命构建真正基础的人们。它将为你的生命带来更伟大的关系，那些强大且鼓舞人心的人们。它将为你的生命带来要求你承担更伟大责任和自律的境况。它将通过对你有所要求和从你身上获得一些东西来增强你。它将让你的个人心灵及其所有的力量和能力为了一个更伟大的目的而投入——去建立一个更伟大的安全和稳定。</p>
<p>Without this, so many people will fall into idleness and give themselves to things that have little or no meaning or value. They will commit themselves to the pursuit of beauty and wealth and leisure at the great expense of their own integrity, stability and security in life.</p>
<p>如果没有这一点，许多人就会陷入懒惰，把他们自己投入到那些毫无意义或价值的事情中。他们会一心追求美丽、财富和闲暇，而牺牲他们自身的完整性、稳定性和安全的生命。</p>
<p>They will follow fear and its endless desire for possessions and for assurances and for recognition. Their life will be built upon weakness and avoidance and false assumptions.</p>
<p>他们会追随恐惧，以及对财产、保证和认可的无尽渴望。他们的生命将建立在软弱、逃避和错误的假设之上。</p>
<p>It is not your responsibility to judge or condemn people, but to learn from their experiences, from the demonstration of both their strengths and their weaknesses. This will convince you beyond a shadow of a doubt of the central importance of Knowledge, and the necessity of building a real foundation for your life.</p>
<p>你的责任并非评判或谴责他人，而是从他们的经验中学习，从他们展现的优势和劣势中学习。这将使你毫无疑问地确信内识的核心重要性，以及为你的生命构建真正基础的必要性。</p>
<p>This will show you that judgment and condemnation are a waste of your time and energy and are harmful to others. This will show you that you came to the world to work, and that you must build a real foundation to provide a greater service in the world.</p>
<p>这将向你表明，评判和谴责是对你的时间和精力的浪费，并且有害于他人。这将向你表明，你来到这个世界是为了工作，你必须构建一个真正的基础，才能在世界上提供更伟大的服务。</p>
<p>Here you cannot be a victim of the world or a victim of change, for you were designed and meant to be a contributor—a person who gives into life situations and who is not overtaken or destroyed by them.</p>
<p>在这里，你无法成为世界的受害者或变革的受害者，因为你被设计并注定要成为一个贡献者——一个能融入生命环境的人，一个不被生命环境超越或摧毁的人。</p>
<p>In your heart, you want this strength. You want this integrity. You want this stability. You want a strong foundation. But you will have to overcome your beliefs, your low self-esteem and many of your tendencies that prevent you from building this foundation and from being able to follow the directions that Knowledge will give you.</p>
<p>在你的内心，你渴望这种力量。你渴望这种完整性。你渴望这种稳定性。你渴望一个坚实的基础。但你必须克服你的信仰、你的低自尊以及你的许多倾向，它们阻碍你构建这个基础，阻碍你遵循内识将赋予你的指引。</p>
<p>It is like you are redoing your whole life. You are tearing it down to its essential elements and rebuilding it based upon real strength and the real wisdom that lives within you that are provided by Knowledge.</p>
<p>它就像你在重塑你的整个生命。你把它拆解成最基本的元素，并基于内识赋予你内在的真正力量和真正智慧来重建它。</p>
<p>Here your personal mind will exert its real responsibilities and exercise its greater Intelligence and capabilities, to serve you and to be of service to others. It will not be self-destructive. It will not be self-hating. It will not be a tool of governments or religious institutions. It will not be used as a weapon of war or as a tool of the state.</p>
<p>在这里，你的个人心灵将发挥它真正的责任，运用它更伟大的智能和能力，来服务你并服务他人。它不会自我毁灭。它不会自我憎恨。它不会成为政府或宗教机构的一个工具。它不会被用作战争武器或国家工具。</p>
<p>But for you this means a tremendous amount of work. For you have to reclaim what has been lost. You have to build what has not been built. You have to re-establish your integrity through experience, through practice and through demonstration. You have to reconsider your commitments, your obligations to others, the value of your relationships and where you stand currently regarding the Four Pillars of your life.</p>
<p>但对你来说，这意味着极大的工作量。因为你必须找回那些已经失去的东西。你必须构建那些尚未被构建的支柱。你必须通过体验、通过实践、通过示范来重建你的完整性。你必须重新思考你的承诺、你对他人的义务、你的关系的价值，以及你目前在你生命四大支柱方面的处境。</p>
<p>Here you must face your life squarely and courageously. For many people that will be very difficult because they will see the deficits and the weakness of their foundation. But it is better to start now than to sink back into denial and avoidance for any reason.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须勇敢而坦然地面对生命。对很多人来说，这会非常困难，因为他们会发现他们的缺陷和根基的薄弱。但与其因为任何原因再次陷入否认和逃避，不如现在就开始。</p>
<p>You start from where you are, not from where you want to be. You are not where you need to be in life, and that is why you are suffering. People around you are not where they need to be in life, and that is why they are suffering. Many people are in the wrong place, with the wrong people, doing the wrong things, and they cannot find peace in that.</p>
<p>你从现状出发，而非从你想要达到的目标出发。你未能达到生命所需的境界，因此你痛苦不堪。你周围的人也未能达到生命所需的境界，因此他们痛苦不堪。许多人身处错误的地方，与错误的人相处，做着错误的事情，却无法从中找到和平。</p>
<p>So this deep evaluation must occur, and it requires great courage. This is where you find your courage and exercise it. If you do not exercise it, you will not have it. It will not be there for you in the future when you will really need it. The same holds true with self-discipline, self-determination and the ability to change your circumstances and your priorities.</p>
<p>所以，这种深度的评估必须进行，这需要伟大的勇气。这正是你找到勇气并运用它的地方。如果你不运用它，你就无法拥有它。当你真正需要它的时候，它也不会在你身边。自律、自决以及改变处境和优先事项的能力也是如此。</p>
<p>Here you are not governed by expectations as much as by a deeper inner certainty. Here you will feel inner restraint regarding those things that you are currently doing that are wasting your time, your energy and your life. If you are ambivalent about being in a relationship, then that ambivalence has to be examined. It may be a sign telling you that this is not the place to commit yourself.</p>
<p>在这里，你不再受期望的支配，而是被一种更深层次的内在确定性所支配。在这里，你会感受到内在的克制，因为你正在做的那些事情正在浪费你的时间、能量和生命。如果你对一段关系感到矛盾，那么这种矛盾就需要被审视。这或许是一个信号，告诉你这里不适合你做出承诺。</p>
<p>Everything you do is important. Even your leisure time, your time of rest, is important, for that is building your Health Pillar. It is supporting good mental and physical health. Nothing you do exists outside these Pillars, and everything you do is either strengthening them or weakening them. Every relationship you have with other people is either strengthening or weakening your connection to Knowledge.</p>
<p>你所做的每件事都很重要。甚至你的闲暇时间，你的休息时间，都很重要，因为那正在构建你的健康支柱。它支持着良好的身心健康。你所做的一切都不存在于这些支柱之外，你所做的每件事要么在强化它们，要么在削弱它们。你与他人的每一种关系要么在强化你与内识的联接，要么在削弱你与内识的联接。</p>
<p>Here that which seems confusing and subjective becomes very clear. Here you can discern what is correct for you to do without endless speculation or inner debate. That which is fearful must follow that which is fearless.</p>
<p>在这里，那些看似令人困惑和主观的事情变得非常清晰。在这里，你可以辨别什么对你来说是正确的，而无需无休止的猜测或内心的争论。恐惧的心灵必然追随无畏的心灵。</p>
<p>Knowledge is fearless. Your personal mind is fearful. It is okay that it is fearful because that is its condition, but it must be employed for a greater purpose and be given a greater incentive and greater wisdom to function constructively and to be the great asset and vehicle of communication that it really is.</p>
<p>内识无所畏惧。你的个人心灵充满恐惧。它感到恐惧没关系，因为那是它的状况，但它必须被用于一个更伟大的目的，被赋予更伟大的激励和更伟大的智慧，才能建设性地运作，并成为它真正作为的伟大资产和沟通载体。</p>
<p>How do you begin? You begin by taking the Steps to Knowledge, by learning what Knowledge is in your experience and how to distinguish it from your own compulsions, your own beliefs and your own fantasies.</p>
<p>你该如何开始？你首先要踏上内识进阶，学习你的经验中蕴含的内识，以及如何将它与你的冲动、你的信仰和你的幻想区分开来。</p>
<p>Here when you see the evidence of Knowledge and follow Knowledge, you learn how to discern it, and you see how utterly distinct it is from your personal mind. Here you see that who you are is not your personal mind and that your personal mind is just a vehicle.</p>
<p>在这里，当你看到内识的证据并遵循内识时，你就会学习如何辨别它，你会看到它与你的个人心灵有多么截然不同。在这里，你会看到，你是谁并非你的个人心灵，你的个人心灵只是一个载体。</p>
<p>It is as if you were flying a craft in space, and your Being is the pilot, the instrument panel is your mind and the ship is your body. If the pilot ceases to function as the pilot, you cannot expect the ship to guide itself, not for very long. You cannot expect the ship to make all the decisions that it must make facing changing circumstances and unforeseen events. The pilot has to be there, guiding the ship, working the control panel.</p>
<p>它就像你在太空中驾驶一艘飞船，你的存在是飞行员，仪表盘是你的心灵，飞船是你的身体。如果飞行员不再发挥飞行员的作用，你就无法指望飞船自行导航，至少不能维持很长时间。你无法指望飞船在面对不断变化的环境和不可预见的事件时做出所有必须做出的决定。飞行员必须在那里，引导飞船，操作控制面板。</p>
<p>It is like this in your life. If Knowledge is not there guiding you, then you are helplessly and hopelessly trying to guide yourself—appealing to other people, appealing to fantastic beliefs, appealing to mythology, appealing to the worst kind of authorities to guide you and to give you a sense of security and direction.</p>
<p>你的生命也是如此。如果内识不在那里指引你，那么你就无助地、绝望地试图指导你自己——诉诸他人，诉诸荒诞的信仰，诉诸神话，诉诸最糟糕的权威来指引你，给你一种安全感和方向感。</p>
<p>Here you become obsessed. Here you fall into obsessive behavior. Here you become disappointed and disillusioned, and your sense of certainty and strength diminishes because you are following things that have no power and no real wisdom.</p>
<p>在这里，你变得痴迷。在这里，你陷入强迫行为。在这里，你变得失望和幻灭，你的确定性和力量感逐渐消退，因为你追随的是没有力量、没有真正智慧的事物。</p>
<p>At every moment you are either becoming stronger or weaker. You are building a foundation or losing a foundation. You are finding your purpose or you are not finding your purpose.</p>
<p>每时每刻，你要么变得更强大，要么变得更弱小。你要么在建立根基，要么在丧失根基。你要么在寻找你的目的，要么还没有找到你的目的。</p>
<p>At this level, things become much more clear, and you become much more certain about what you are doing and how to make the right decisions in accordance with your deeper nature.</p>
<p>在这个层面上，事情变得更加清晰，你也更加确定你正在做什么，以及如何根据你更深层次的自然做出正确的决定。</p>
<p>Here self-confidence grows. Here your sense of well-being grows. Here you are able to stand away from fearful imagination and to look at things objectively and clearly, even in the face of danger, even in the face of great uncertainty.</p>
<p>在这里，自信会增长。在这里，你的幸福感会增长。在这里，你能够远离恐惧的想象，客观而清晰地看待事物，即使面对危险，即使面对巨大的不确定性。</p>
<p>Here you must find the power of Knowledge. Learn how it expresses itself in your life. Learn how it feels. Feel when it is restraining you. Feel when it is guiding you or motivating you. Learn to penetrate the surface of your mind, to see the great well of silence that exists beneath this surface, the great well of silence where Knowledge exists.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须找到内识的力量。学习它如何在你的生命中表达它自己。学习它有何感受。感受它何时在限制你。感受它何时在引导你或激励你。学习穿透你心灵的表面，去看见存在于这表面之下的伟大寂静之井，内识存在的伟大寂静之井。</p>
<p>You will need a study to do this. You will need a preparation not of your own making. You cannot follow an eclectic approach that is based on personal preference, for this will take you nowhere. You must follow a pathway that was not created by you or manipulated by you.</p>
<p>你需要进行研究才能做到这一点。你需要一种并非由你自身做的准备。你不能遵循一种基于个人偏好的折衷方法，因为这将毫无意义。你必须遵循一条并非由你创造或操控的道路。</p>
<p>God has sent a New Message into the world to teach about spirituality at the level of Knowledge, to teach about the reality of the Four Pillars of life. You have a pathway. You can find this pathway even through your existing religious traditions if you have someone wise enough to guide you and to help you to understand how to proceed. Yet most people do not have a guide of this nature, and that is why the New Message will be very essential for many people.</p>
<p>上帝向世界发送了一条新讯息，在内识层面教导精神性，教导生命四大支柱的现实。你拥有一条道路。即使通过你现有的宗教传统，只要你拥有足够明智的人来指引你，帮助你理解如何前行，你也能找到这条道路。然而大多数人并没有这样的指引，正因如此，新讯息对很多人来说至关重要。</p>
<p>If you think the world is difficult now, you do not yet realize how difficult the times to come will be, and how strong you must be to weather these storms and to navigate the uncertain and difficult times ahead.</p>
<p>如果你认为现在的世界很艰难，那么你还没有意识到未来的岁月将会有多么艰难，以及你必须有多么强大才能抵御这些风暴并度过未来不确定和困难的时期。</p>
<p>This is part of the warning that God’s New Message presents. And that is why building your foundation in Knowledge, and learning how to see yourself and to discern your needs at the level of the body, the mind and the soul is so fundamental to your success and your ability not only to survive in a difficult future, but to be of great service to the world. It is this service that will give you satisfaction and fulfillment in this life as nothing else can.</p>
<p>这是上帝新讯息所呈现的警示的一部分。正因如此，构建你的内识基础，学习如何看待你自己，并在身体、心灵和灵魂的层面辨识你的需求，对于你的成功，以及你不仅能够在艰难的未来生存，而且能够为世界提供伟大服务的能力，是如此根本。正是这种服务，将赋予你此生无与伦比的满足感和充实感。</p>
<p>It is this where you must place your faith, but not your faith alone—your committed activity. For you cannot merely hope that God will preserve you. You must diligently follow what God has placed within you to guide you, to protect you, and to lead you forward.</p>
<p>你必须将信仰寄托于此，但不能仅仅寄托于信仰——你的承诺活动。因为你不能仅仅希望上帝会保护你。你必须孜孜不倦地追随上帝放置在你内在指引你、保护你、引领你前行的内识。</p>
<p>This is the blessing, and this is your responsibility. Do not neglect it. For everything you value and want for yourself that is true and authentic will be found by following what God has given you to follow, to do what God has given you to do, and to be what God has given you to be.</p>
<p>这就是祝福，也是你的责任。不要忽视它。因为你珍视的一切，以及你渴望的一切真实之物，都将在遵循上帝赐予你的道路、做上帝赋予你的事情、成为上帝赋予你的那个人的过程中找到。</p>
