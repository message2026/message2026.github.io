<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on March 21, 2000 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2000 年 3 月 21 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many people today are very ambitious regarding spirituality and spiritual direction. They think really that they are messengers for God and that their beliefs and associations and ideals are really something bigger than they are. They insist upon this position, not understanding that God’s Messages are rarely given. They have assigned themselves to be God’s representatives, but they are not, not really, not in this way.</p>
<p>当今许多人对精神性和精神指引抱有极大的野心。他们自认为是上帝的信使，他们的信仰、协会和理想实际上比他们更大。他们坚持这样的立场，却不理解上帝的讯息很少被给予。他们自诩为上帝的代表，但他们不是，真的不是，不是以这种方式。</p>
<p>It is their ambition and their ideology that drives them on, that makes them make these assumptions and that makes them think and believe, even fervently, that they are so endowed with the Divine. They claim that their messages are profound and come from a greater source. But this is not true because God’s Messages are rare, as We have said. They are not given frequently. They are never given to the ambitious. They are never given to those who would assign themselves splendid roles.</p>
<p>正是他们的野心和意识形态驱使他们前行，使他们做出这些假设，使他们认为并甚至狂热地相信，他们拥有如此神圣的天赋。他们声称他们的讯息深奥难懂，来自更伟大的来源。但这并非事实，因为正如我们所说，上帝的讯息是罕见的。它们并不经常被赐予。它们从不赐予雄心勃勃的人。它们从不赐予那些自命不凡之人。</p>
<p>Indeed, those chosen to be the true Messengers are reluctant, even to the point of self-denial. They do not really want the job. But they will accept it because of who asks it of them. They do not really want to shine in the world as an Emissary or as a Messenger. This is almost painful to them. They are more retiring, more private, more discreet. And yet these are the ones who are chosen to be the real Messengers, and there are not many of them. Everyone else is chosen or appointed to support the Message.</p>
<p>事实上，那些被选中成为真正信使的人并不情愿，甚至到了自我否定的地步。他们并不真正想要这份工作。但他们会接受这份工作，因为是谁要求他们这样做的。他们并非真正想作为一名使者或信使在世上闪耀。这对他们来说几乎是痛苦的。他们更想隐居，更想私密，更想谨慎。然而，就是这些人被选中成为真正的信使，而且这样的人并不多。其他所有人都是被选中或任命来支持这个讯息的。</p>
<p>It is not necessary for God to communicate profound Messages to humanity very often. This is a very serious thing. It does not happen that often. Yet the ambitious will assign themselves the role and the privilege of delivering messages from a higher source.</p>
<p>上帝无需频繁地向人类传达深奥的讯息。这是一件非常严肃的事情，并不经常发生。然而，雄心勃勃的人会赋予他们自己传递更高源头讯息的角色和特权。</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these people often become representatives of the Intervention and proponents of the whole Pacification Program. They have very strong views about what is spiritual, and then they appeal to higher powers to substantiate what they believe and to anoint them as the representatives of a greater truth. How perfect this is for the Intervention.</p>
<p>不幸的是，这些人常常成为干预的代表和整个安抚计划的支持者。他们对精神有着非常强烈的看法，然后他们诉诸更高的力量来证实他们的信仰，并任命他们为更伟大真理的代表。这对干预来说是多么完美啊。</p>
<p>People who assign themselves these roles and responsibilities are not the Emissaries of the Creator. At best, they are the emissaries of their own ambition and their own failed ideologies. At worst, they fall into service to powers that they cannot even recognize and begin to endorse, represent and propose things, the source of which is unknown to them. They have claimed they are not the authors of their own demonstration. And because they do not want to even think that they are the authors of their own demonstration, they will naturally appeal to any other source that to them represents a kind of spiritual power. It is this kind of self-deception, it is this kind of self-glorification that would make one extremely vulnerable to manipulation from beyond.</p>
<p>那些给他们自己分配这些角色和责任的人并非造物主的信使。往好了说，他们不过是他们自身野心和他们自身失败意识形态的使者。往坏了说，他们沦为自身甚至无法认出的力量的使者，开始认可、代表和提议那些他们根本不知道来源的东西。他们声称他们并非他们自身演示的发起者。正因为他们甚至不愿认为他们是他们自身演示的发起者，他们自然会诉诸于任何其他对他们而言代表着某种精神力量的来源。正是这种自欺欺人、这种自我吹捧，才会让人极易受到来自外界的操控。</p>
<p>These are the ones who will renounce the true Messengers when they arrive, for they are affronted by the true Messengers. They are not impressed by the true Messengers because they think true Messengers must be dynamic, magnificent and very self-assertive, like they are, or like they think they should be. Yet the Messengers are rarely like this.</p>
<p>这些人会在真正的信使到来时抛弃他们，因为他们被真正的信使冒犯了。他们对真正的信使不以为然，因为他们认为真正的信使必须充满活力、宏伟壮丽、非常自信，就像他们那样，或者像他们认为他们应该的那样。然而，信使们却很少如此。</p>
<p>And so these people, those who are self-appointed, become the harshest critics of the true Messengers when they arrive, for their own position is threatened. Their ideology is endangered. Their appointment by a divine power is thrown into question. They will say, “Well, we are all messengers for the divine.” And they will try to spread the whole idea of self-appointment to so many other people, some of whom will respond eagerly, seeing this as a means to offset their low self-esteem and to give them a sense of identity and direction that they are lacking.</p>
<p>因此，这些自封的人，在真正的信使到来时，会成为最严厉的批评者，因为他们自身的地位受到了威胁。他们的意识形态受到了威胁。他们被一种神圣力量任命的事实受到了质疑。他们会说：“好吧，我们都是神圣信使。”他们会试图把整个自封的想法传播给许多其他人，其中一些人会热切地回应，把这看作是弥补他们低落的自尊，并赋予他们一种他们所缺乏的身份认同和方向感的一种手段。</p>
<p>None of this, of course, comes from Knowledge. It is all a creation of the personal mind for self-glorification and for self-acknowledgement. They look at the greater spiritual powers in the world as a stamp of approval, and they will grant themselves this approval. The voices that they hear that they select and that they even want will only be those voices that substantiate their views, their beliefs and their ideas about themselves.</p>
<p>当然，这一切都不源自内识。这一切都是个人心灵为了自我荣耀和自我认知而创造的。他们把世界上更伟大的精神力量视为一种认可的标志，并且他们将给予他们自己这种认可。他们听到的、他们选择的、甚至他们想要的声音，只会是那些证实他们的观点、他们的信仰和他们关于他们自身的想法的声音。</p>
<p>There are many of these people right now, in all faith traditions. Every faith tradition has people like this, who believe that they are messengers, that they have a greater truth to present and to demonstrate. They are the ones who can become zealous and destructive, who take matters into their own hands and who decide, believing that they are divinely guided, of course, that they can determine what is just and unjust, what is spiritually correct and spiritually incorrect.</p>
<p>现在，在所有信仰传统中，都有很多这样的人。每个信仰传统都有这样的人，他们相信他们是信使，相信他们拥有一种更伟大的真理要呈现和展现。他们可能变得狂热和具有破坏性，他们擅自决定事情，他们相信他们受到神的指引，当然，他们相信他们可以决定什么是正义，什么是非正义，什么是精神上的正确，什么是精神上的错误。</p>
<p>All students of Knowledge must be aware of these individuals. All students of Knowledge must ask themselves, “Am I trying to fulfill myself here?” If you come to serve, then you must have great humility. If you come to be a real student, then you must follow a greater way and not invent the journey for yourself. If you sincerely seek the truth of Knowledge and the reality of Knowledge in your life, then you must come with humility, without assumptions about yourself. And you must not base your approach upon an ideology that may in fact not be based upon Knowledge at all.</p>
<p>所有内识的学生都必须察觉这些人。所有内识的学生都必须问他们自己：“我是否试图在这里成就我自己？”如果你来此服务，那么你必须拥有伟大的谦逊。如果你来此成为一名真正的学生，那么你必须遵循一条更伟大的道路，而非为你自己发明旅程。如果你真诚地寻求内识的真理以及内识在你生命中的现实，那么你必须带着谦逊而来，不对你自己抱有任何假设。 你绝不能将你的途径建立在一种实际上可能根本不基于内识的意识形态之上。</p>
<p>Humility, patience, perseverance, honesty, discretion, discernment—all essential qualities for true accomplishment. And yet you do not see these qualities demonstrated by many people, especially by many people who claim to be spiritual authorities.</p>
<p>谦逊、耐心、毅力、诚实、谨慎、辨别力——这些都是真正成就的必备品质。然而，在很多人身上，尤其是在很多自称是精神权威的人身上，你却看不到这些品质。</p>
<p>People who claim to be psychic, to be clairvoyant, to have unique and special powers—these people are especially vulnerable to manipulation from beyond. Because they give themselves such high rank in the spiritual hierarchy, because they consider themselves to be so unique among human beings, and because they seek recognition and approval for their ideas, these people will be very, very good candidates for manipulation and can well fall in with the Intervention, in all of its manifestations. Willing now to serve a greater power and believing that they are endowed to do so, they assign themselves the role of emissaries.</p>
<p>那些自称拥有通灵能力、千里眼、拥有独特特殊力量的人——这些人尤其容易受到来自外来势力的操控。因为他们认为他们自己在精神层次中的地位很高，因为他们认为他们自己在人类中是独一无二的，因为他们为他们的想法寻求认可和赞许，所以这些人将是非常非常好的操纵对象，他们很可能会落入各种表现形式的干预之中。现在，他们愿意为一种更强大的力量服务，并相信他们有能力做到这一点，他们赋予他们自己使者的角色。</p>
<p>Be very careful with these people. Remain silent around them. But see clearly. The true Messengers are never adamant about themselves. They never claim special gifts and powers for themselves. Even their own genuine appointment, if they have to talk about it, they will do so rather reluctantly. They are not dynamic and strong. They do not project their personality in this way. They are not indiscreet. They are not loud and brash.</p>
<p>对待这些人要非常小心。在他们身边保持沉默。但要看清楚。真正的信使从不固执己见。他们从不宣称他们自己拥有特殊的天赋和力量。即使是他们自身真正的任命，如果他们不得不谈论它，他们也会相当不情愿。他们并非充满活力和强势。他们不会以这种方式展现他们的人性。他们并非轻率。他们并非喧嚣而傲慢。</p>
<p>There are so many people claiming to be spiritual emissaries that when the real one appears, they go unnoticed because they are quiet, because they are not loud and brash and indiscreet. They may not gain much attention, for the attention is all being gathered by those who beat their own drum and who proclaim themselves proudly, with great conviction.</p>
<p>自称是精神使者的人太多了，以至于当真正的使者出现时，他们往往因为低调、不喧嚣、不傲慢、不轻率而无人注意。他们或许不会获得太多关注，因为所有的注意力都被那些自吹自擂、骄傲自大、充满自信的人所吸引。</p>
<p>Who can tell who is the real Emissary? And how can you tell? We have already begun to answer this question. You can tell because of the content of their message. You can tell because of the humility of their approach. And you can tell if this is a false humility or if it is really genuine. For as We have said, those who are selected are rather reluctant. They do not want to proclaim themselves really. And if they do so, it is because they are asked to do so, not because they want it for themselves.</p>
<p>谁能分辨谁是真正的使者？又如何分辨？我们已经开始回答这个问题。你可以通过他们讯息的内容来判断。你可以通过他们行事方式的谦逊来判断。你还可以分辨出这究竟是虚假的谦逊，还是真正的谦逊。因为正如我们所说，那些被选中的人相当不情愿。他们并不想真正地宣示他们自己。如果他们这样做，那是因为他们被要求这样做，而不是因为他们自己想要这样做。</p>
<p>This is a very serious matter here. The true Emissaries bring something unique and remarkable into the world. They do not simply restate the popular ideas. They do not claim their own spiritual or intuitive powers. They do not call upon their uniqueness. Look at the content of their message. Is it about them and their abilities? Or is it about something really greater than them? Does their message emphasize their uniqueness, or does it speak about greater things? Is their message really new and revolutionary, or is it simply a restatement of what so many others have claimed? Again We must say, those who proclaim themselves are not the true Emissaries because they are not chosen. And they are not chosen because of these tendencies that We are describing.</p>
<p>这是一个非常严肃的问题。真正的使者为世界带来了一种独特而非凡的讯息。他们并非简单地重申流行的观点。他们并非宣称拥有他们自身的精神或直觉力量。他们并非呼唤他们的独特性。审视他们讯息的内容。是关于他们自己和他们的能力吗？还是关于某种真正比他们更伟大的内识？他们的讯息是否强调了他们的独特性，还是在讲述更伟大的事物？他们的讯息是否真的新颖且具有革命性，还是仅仅是对许多其他人所宣称的事情的重申？我们必须再次强调，那些自称是真正使者的人并非真正的使者，因为他们并非被选中。而他们并非因为我们所描述的这些倾向而被选中。</p>
<p>So you look for that which is true and for that which is unique. If they are real Messengers, they are presenting something really new. Ask yourself, “Are these emissaries really presenting something new, or are they just presenting themselves and using what seems popular or conventional or even radical in the moment, yet well documented from before? Is there real substance and merit to their presentation?” Some people say, “Well, there is teaching at all levels. All spiritual teaching is valid.” But this is really just an excuse, just an excuse.</p>
<p>因此，你寻找真实之物，寻找独特之物。如果他们是真正的信使，他们就呈现某种真正新颖的东西。问问你自己：“这些使者真的在呈现某种新的东西吗？还是他们只是在自我呈现，使用当下看似流行、传统甚至激进，但过去却有充分记载的事情？他们的呈现有真正的实质和价值吗？”有些人说：“嗯，各个层面都有教导。所有精神教导都是有效的。”但这实际上只是一个借口，只是一个借口。</p>
<p>There are very few true emissaries. There are many people who are called to serve and many people who can serve in a real way. And there are many people who do serve in a real way. But to be an Emissary, to be a representative, to be a Messenger, well, that is really something else. That is reserved for a very few people.</p>
<p>真正的使者寥寥无几。许多人被召唤去服务，许多人能够以真正的方式服务。许多人确实以真正的方式服务。但成为一名使者，成为一名代表，成为一名信使，嗯，那真的是另一回事。那是为极少数人保留的。</p>
<p>And one of the reasons that this role is not chosen by those who are selected is because the role itself is quite difficult. You are asked to express something new and challenging. You are asked to go beyond your whole idea of self to take a position in life, presenting something that even you yourself can barely understand. You put yourself in a position to take condemnation and ridicule, to put yourself in the middle of a great struggle for the conscience of humanity. You lose your friends, your family, your position in life, and you embark on a new journey, the outcome of which is uncertain and unknown.</p>
<p>而这个角色之所以没有被选中，原因之一在于它本身就相当困难。你被要求表达一些新的、具有挑战性的事情。你被要求超越你对自我的整体认知，在生命中站稳脚跟，展现一些连你自己都难以理解的东西。你把你自己置于一个承受谴责和嘲笑的位置，置身于一场为人类良知而展开的伟大斗争之中。你失去了朋友、家人和人生地位，踏上了一段新的旅程，而这段旅程的结果充满不确定性和未知。</p>
<p>These are not the tribulations of the person who serves in a genuine way. These are the tribulations of the person who is the real Emissary. Is this something people really would want for themselves? Is this the goal of the ambitious, the self-seeking and the self-serving—to travel this difficult journey, to carry such a great burden with so little seeming recognition and support?</p>
<p>这些并非以真诚方式服务的人的苦难。这些是作为真正使者的人的苦难。这真的是人们真正想要的事情吗？难道这就是野心家、自我追求者和自我服务者的目标——踏上这段艰难的旅程，背负如此沉重的负担，却得不到看似如此之少的承认和支持？</p>
<p>This is why those who are ambitious are never chosen. They are never chosen because of their tendencies, but they are also never chosen because they would not yield themselves to this greater responsibility. They seek recognition and self-glorification, but that is not what the role of a real Messenger and Emissary provides.</p>
<p>正因如此，那些雄心勃勃的人永远不会被选中。他们永远不会因为他们的倾向而被选中，但他们也永远不会因为他们不愿臣服于这个更伟大责任而被选中。他们寻求认可和自我荣耀，但这并非一名真正的信使和使者角色所提供的。</p>
<p>Consider the story of Jesus. Yes, he gained great attention, but who were his true allies? Who remained true to him throughout his career? Who put themselves at risk to be his representatives and his witnesses? The ambitious? The self-seeking? Those who were immersed in their spiritual pride, who claimed unique and special powers and gifts for themselves? No, they were nowhere to be found. But they arose after Jesus’s death to claim that they were his representatives.</p>
<p>想想耶稣的故事。没错，他的确备受瞩目，但谁是他真正的盟友？谁在他的一生中始终忠于他？谁甘愿冒着风险成为他的代表和见证人？是那些野心勃勃的人吗？是那些自私自利的人吗？是那些沉溺于属灵骄傲、自称拥有独特能力和恩赐的人吗？不，他们根本不存在。但他们在耶稣死后兴起，声称自己是他的代表。</p>
<p>In all faith traditions, this occurs and is occurring. It is really a very sad tendency, but it is inherent in the condition of humanity today. Some people will never wait to be chosen, so they choose themselves because they need something to believe in, to give themselves to. They need a sense of identity and purpose and meaning. And though they are not really chosen by the Divine, they choose themselves in the name of the Divine and claim to be the representatives and emissaries of the Divine. But their message has no substance and no originality. Their emphasis is upon themselves rather than upon the teaching. Whenever the teacher becomes more important than the teaching, or when the teacher is the teaching itself, watch out. Be careful.</p>
<p>在所有的信仰传统中，这种情况都曾发生过，而且正在发生。这确实是一种令人悲伤的倾向，但它却是当今人类境况的固有特征。有些人永远不会等待被选择，所以他们选择他们自己，因为他们需要某种信仰，需要为之献身。他们需要一种身份认同、目的和意义。尽管他们并非真正被神选中，但他们以神的名义选择自己，并自称是神的代表和使者。但他们的讯息缺乏实质内容，也缺乏原创性。他们强调的是自身，而不是教导。每当老师变得比教导更重要，或者老师就是教导本身时，就要小心了。要小心。</p>
<p>When these emissaries pass away, what is left? What is their legacy? Now that they are no longer there to proclaim themselves, is there anything left behind of real substance and value? Or were they only a billboard for themselves and their professed powers and abilities?</p>
<p>当这些使者逝去，留下了什么？他们的遗产又是什么？如今他们不再在那里宣扬他们自己，留下了什么真正有实质内容和价值的东西吗？还是他们只是一块用来炫耀他们自己和他们所宣称的权力和能力的招牌？</p>
<p>For the student of Knowledge, real discernment must prevail here. We have chosen the Emissary for this Teaching. There are no others who can claim the role as the Messenger for The Greater Community Way. Even after Marshall leaves this world, there will not be an emissary. There will only be those who are appointed to carry on what he has begun. And they will be chosen not because of their aggressiveness or their charm or their ambitions. The ones who will be chosen will be simple and humble and self-effacing. For these ones will be reliable and will not corrupt the Message for their own advantage.</p>
<p>对于内识的学生来说，真正的辨别力在此至关重要。我们已经为这个教程选择了使者。没有其他人可以自称是大社区之路的信使。即使在马歇尔离开这个世界之后，也不会再有使者。只有那些被任命来继承他所开创事业的人。他们被选中，并非因为他们的进取心、魅力或野心。被选中的人将是朴素、谦逊和低调的。因为这些人将是可靠的，不会为了一己私利而歪曲讯息。</p>
<p>But every student of Knowledge must recognize the falsity of those who proclaim themselves in the name of the Creator or in the name of the spiritual agents. Use discernment. Use the criteria that we have given. Pay special attention to those who claim that all they want is to become servants of God. Because before you know it, if it has not happened already, they are servants and now they are delivering messages. And they think that they are really high and advanced and very endowed. Look at these people and look at their communication. Knowledge will only respond to Knowledge. So if Knowledge in you does not respond, you had better move on.</p>
<p>但每一位内识的学生都必须认识到那些以造物主或精神媒介之名自称之人的虚伪。运用辨识力。运用我们给出的标准。特别留意那些声称他们只想成为上帝仆人的人。因为在你不知不觉中，如果这还没有发生，他们就是仆人，现在他们正在传递讯息。他们认为他们真的很高尚、先进、天赋异禀。看看这些人，看看他们的交流。内识只会回应内识。所以，如果你内在的内识没有回应，你最好继续前行。</p>
<p>Already, there have been those who have proclaimed themselves to Marshall as his partners in the Revelation, saying that they have part of the Message and that he has another part. And he has had to deny them. For they were all mistaken.</p>
<p>已经有人向马歇尔宣称他们自己是他的启示伙伴，声称他们掌握了一部分讯息，而他掌握了另一部分。但他不得不否认他们。因为他们都是错误的。</p>
<p>You will hear these individuals and they will arise in your midst, proclaiming even that they are emissaries for The Greater Community Way, saying that one person is not enough, that there must be many messengers. But we have made it very clear that this is not how the Revelation is brought into the world. This is not how true initiation takes place.</p>
<p>你会听到这些人，他们会出现在你们中间，甚至宣称他们是大社区之路的使者，说一个人不够，必须有很多信使。但我们已经非常明确地表明，这并非启示被带入世界的方式。这并非真正入门发生的方式。</p>
<p>Some people will say, “Well, this is all about Marshall. He is claiming that he is the one and denying anyone else who claims that they have spiritual gifts as well.” But this is not true. For Marshall has been chosen. He did not choose himself. He has only denied those who claimed to share this authority with him because he was required to do this. We know everyone wants to be special, and some people want to be spiritually special to the point even where they believe that they are spiritually special and that their “specialness” has been confirmed and anointed by greater spiritual powers. They will look at Marshall and they will say, “Yes, yes, he is one of us, one of many, many emissaries.” And they may even say to those who follow them, “Oh, yes, you can be an emissary too. Just open yourself up and give yourself over.”</p>
<p>有人会说：“好吧，这全都是马歇尔的事。他声称自己就是那位，并否认任何声称他们也拥有精神礼物的人。”但事实并非如此。因为马歇尔是被拣选的。他并没有选择他自己。他只是拒绝了那些声称与他共享这权柄的人，因为他被要求这样做。我们知道每个人都想成为特别的人，有些人甚至渴望在精神上变得特别，甚至相信他们在精神上是特别的，并且他们的“特别”已经得到了更伟大的精神力量的确认和恩赐。他们会看着马歇尔说：“是的，是的，他是我们中的一员，是众多使者之一。” 他们甚至会对跟随他们的人说：“哦，是的，你也可以成为使者。只要打开你自己，放弃你自己。”</p>
<p>This is not about Marshall. Though he has been given a special task, and a unique one at that, it is not about him. For when Marshall passes away, what he leaves will be great and deep and long lasting. That is a true sign that he is a real Emissary and a true Messenger, for the Message is not about him and is greater than he is. He may be the best authority in the world regarding the Message. He may be the teacher of the Message. But the Message is bigger. It is not about him.</p>
<p>这与马歇尔无关。尽管他被赋予了一项特殊的任务，而且是一项独一无二的任务，但这与他无关。因为当马歇尔去世时，他留下的将是伟大、深刻而持久的。这才是他是一位真正的使者和信使的真实标志，因为讯息并非关于他，而是比他更伟大。他或许是世界上关于讯息的最佳权威。他或许是讯息的老师。但讯息更伟大。它不是关于他的。</p>
<p>Marshall has special powers, but he will not proclaim them. No one will ever know really who and what he is except those who are very close to him and those few and rare people who can recognize this through the Sacred Writings.</p>
<p>马歇尔拥有特殊力量，但他不愿公开宣扬。除了那些与他关系密切的人，以及那些能够通过圣典辨认出这一点的少数人之外，没有人会真正知道他是谁，是什么。</p>
<p>Be careful then about anyone coming to claim that they too are emissaries of The Greater Community Way. For they are self-deceived, and in some cases, they may be deceived by those who lead them.</p>
<p>所以，要小心那些声称他们也是大社区之路使者的人。因为他们是自欺欺人的，而且在某些情况下，他们也可能被他们的领导者欺骗。</p>
<p>It only takes one person to deliver a New Message from God, and this person will carry a great burden and face grave difficulties in life and will make many sacrifices. They will not be ambitious. They will not be self-proclaiming. For those who are chosen never have these qualities.</p>
<p>传递来自上帝的新讯息只需要一个人，这个人将肩负重担，面对人生的严峻挑战，并做出诸多牺牲。他们不会雄心勃勃，不会自吹自擂。因为那些被选中的人永远不会具备这些品质。</p>
<p>It takes one person to bring the Message. It takes many to implement the Message, to substantiate the Message, to demonstrate the Message. This is for everyone else. They have in many ways an easier task, a happier task, though this task has its great challenges as well.</p>
<p>传递讯息只需一个人。践行讯息、证实讯息、展现讯息则需要许多人。这是为了其他所有人。从很多方面来说，他们的任务更轻松，更快乐，尽管这项任务也面临着它伟大的挑战。</p>
<p>One must use great discernment and discretion in finding one’s true path in life, for there are many options presented. There are many allurements. Some self-appointed spiritual teachers claim that they can make you a spiritual teacher, that they can make anyone a spiritual teacher, as if they have the power to appoint and anoint an emissary for God. They will say, “Yes, you too have a message from God. Everyone has a message from God. Come to my seminar, and I will teach you how.” They think that they can provide this direction and bestow upon their followers these special gifts. They will say, “Yes, everyone has a unique gift from God.” Which is actually true, everyone does. But it is not to be an emissary.</p>
<p>一个人必须运用伟大的辨别力和判断力，才能找到自己真正的人生道路，因为面前摆着诸多选择，也充斥着诸多诱惑。有些自封的精神导师声称，他们可以让你成为精神导师，他们可以把任何人都变成精神导师，仿佛他们有能力为上帝任命和受膏一位使者。他们会说：“是的，你也有来自上帝的讯息。每个人都有来自上帝的讯息。来参加我的研讨会，我会教你如何去做。”他们认为他们可以提供这种指引，并赋予追随者这些特殊的礼物。他们会说：“是的，每个人都拥有来自上帝的独特礼物。”这确实是真的，每个人都有。但这并不意味着他们就是一位使者。</p>
<p>Be very careful then. The true teacher and the true student can often go unnoticed because there is so much noise being made by those who are proclaiming themselves only. And because of the nature of the Intervention and the Pacification Program, you must take special care regarding these matters. For the proponents of the Intervention will more than likely be those who are self-serving and seek substantiation for themselves.</p>
<p>那么要非常小心。真正的老师和真正的学生常常会被忽视，因为那些只标榜他们自己的人制造了太多噪音。而且由于干预和安抚计划的性质，你必须特别注意这些事情。因为干预的支持者很可能是那些自私自利、为他们自己寻求证实的人。</p>
<p>They all make the way harder for the true Emissary because now there is disappointment and suspicion. People have recognized falsehood in many teachers and now they suspect all teachers, and so when the true emissary comes, well, he will bear the brunt of this. He will be doubted and maligned and blamed for the failures of so many others who really could not substantiate themselves.</p>
<p>所有这些都让真正的使者之路更加艰难，因为现在充满了失望和怀疑。人们已经认出许多老师的虚伪，现在他们怀疑所有的老师，所以当真正的使者到来时，嗯，他将首当其冲。他将受到怀疑、诽谤，并将许多其他无法证实他们自己观点的人的失败归咎于他。</p>
<p>It is necessary that We give this perspective because people do not understand the nature of spiritual appointment. They do not understand that you are chosen and that you cannot choose yourself. They do not understand who is chosen and why they are chosen and what being an Emissary really means and requires.</p>
<p>我们有必要给出这个视角，因为人们不理解精神任命的自然。他们不理解你被选中，而你无法选择你自己。他们不理解谁被选中，为什么他们被选中，以及成为一名使者真正意味着什么和要求什么。</p>
<p>There are many things that can be taught at many levels, and you can teach things as long as you do not appoint yourself special powers or gifts. Do not call yourself an emissary or a messenger from God. For whenever you think you are an emissary or a messenger, you can be sure that you are appointing yourself and have not been appointed.</p>
<p>很多事情可以在很多层面上被传授，只要你不给你自己赋予特殊的力量或礼物，你就能传授。不要自称是上帝的使者或信使。因为无论何时，只要你认为你自己是使者或信使，你就可以肯定，你是在自封，而不是被封。</p>
<p>The Creator is extremely careful about who is selected. And they [those selected] will be very reluctant to make a proclamation of who and what they really are. They will go unnoticed amidst all of the noise, all of the wild statements that people make about themselves and their teachings and their messages. And the real student will have to be very, very patient in finding the real teacher because the real teachers are rare. They are in the recesses of the world and are not out there proclaiming themselves and their special gifts and dispensations.</p>
<p>造物主对于谁被选中极其谨慎。他们（那些被选中的人）将非常不情愿宣告他们的真实身份。他们将在人们关于他们自己、他们的教导和他们的讯息的喧嚣、所有狂妄言论中被忽视。真正的学生必须非常非常耐心才能找到真正的老师，因为真正的老师很少见。他们隐藏在世界的角落里，不会在那里宣扬他们自己以及他们特殊的礼物和启示。</p>
