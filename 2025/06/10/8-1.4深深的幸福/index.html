<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on September 13, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 9 月 13 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a greater happiness and fulfillment awaiting you. It is a greater happiness and fulfillment that will be the result of being deeply connected to the greater purpose and meaning of your life.</p>
<p>一种更伟大的幸福和满足正在等待着你。这种更伟大的幸福和满足，将源于你与生命更伟大的目的和意义的深刻联结。</p>
<p>It will not be a happiness that is momentary, such as the happiness you derive from pleasurable stimulation. It is not a happiness that you must go to great lengths to achieve through outward activities or recreation.</p>
<p>它不是那种短暂的幸福，比如你从愉悦的刺激中获得的幸福，也不是那种你必须竭尽全力通过外部活动或娱乐才能获得的幸福。</p>
<p>It is more of an abiding sense of being connected within yourself, of being a complete person, of being whole. It is a happiness born of realizing you are here for a greater purpose, and that even though that purpose remains as yet undefined and unfulfilled, you feel connected to it. And you have the freedom to follow it.</p>
<p>它更像是一种持久的感觉，即与你自己内心的相连感，一种成为一个完整个体、一个整体的感觉。它是一种幸福，源于你意识到你身处此地是为了一个更伟大的目的，即使这个目的尚未明确和实现，你仍能感受到与它相连。你拥有追随它的自由。</p>
<p>Trying to be happily stimulated all day long, trying to escape from your own deeper feelings and greater responsibilities in life, is very attractive for many people, of course. There are things within themselves they do not want to face. There are things in the world they do not want to face. There are Great Waves of change coming to the world that they do not want to face. And the happiness they are trying to secure and to protect is very fleeting and is fraught with much anxiety and much concern.</p>
<p>试图整天快乐地被刺激，试图逃避你自身更深层次的感受和生命中更伟大的责任，当然对许多人来说非常有吸引力。他们内心有些事情他们自己不想面对。世界上有些事情他们不想面对。世界正在经历巨浪般的变革，他们也不想面对。他们试图维系和守护的幸福转瞬即逝，充满了巨大的焦虑和担忧。</p>
<p>For when you are not really connected to the deeper current of your life, you are ill at ease, you are restless, you are agitated, you are uncomfortable. To be out of sync with yourself, out of relationship with your deeper nature, cannot produce any kind of real comfort or consolation. Trying to escape yourself, trying not to see what is coming over the horizon of your life, only adds to this discomfort.</p>
<p>因为当你无法真正连接到你生命更深层的潮流时，你会感到不安、焦躁、烦躁、不适。与你自己失去同步，与你更深层次的自然失去联系，无法带来任何真正的慰藉或安慰。试图逃避你自己，试图对即将出现在你生命地平线上的一切视而不见，只会加剧这种不适。</p>
<p>Now happiness becomes a kind of drug. You want to take a drug or an escape that will relieve you of your constant anxiety and nervousness. You want to be frivolous, you want to be carefree, you want to be lighthearted. But you are living under a dark cloud of uncertainty.</p>
<p>如今，幸福变成了一种毒品。你想嗑药，想逃避，好让你摆脱持续不断的焦虑和紧张。你想轻佻，想无忧无虑，想轻松愉快。但你却生活在一片充满不确定性的阴云之下。</p>
<p>Being out of relationship with your deeper nature makes it very difficult to have any kind of meaningful relationship with any other person, for you will want to avoid in them what you are avoiding in yourself. And you hope that your being together does not stimulate unpleasant feelings or painful memories. You try to behave well—not to be angry, irritable or critical. You have to restrain yourself. You cannot be at ease.</p>
<p>与你更深层次的自然关系的断裂，让你很难与他人建立任何有意义的关系，因为你会想在他们身上避免你在你自己身上所避免的一切。你希望你们在一起不会激发不愉快的感受或痛苦的回忆。你努力表现得体——不愤怒、不烦躁、不批评。你必须克制你自己。你无法安心。</p>
<p>These afflictions are so common that people consider this to be a normal way of life, a normal state of awareness. People lose themselves in work, feeling that their overactivity is always justified. People lose themselves in their romances, in the difficulties of others. They lose themselves in their hobbies, or their overemphasis on trivial things, trying to be happy.</p>
<p>这些痛苦如此普遍，以至于人们认为这是一种正常的生活方式，一种正常的觉知状态。人们沉迷于工作，觉得他们的过度活跃总是合情合理的。人们沉迷于爱情，沉迷于他人的困境。他们沉迷于他们自身的爱好，或者过度关注琐碎的事情，试图追求快乐。</p>
<p>Trying to be happy leads to self-deception, for you will find yourself denying your own experience and much of reality around yourself in order to try to preserve this sense of being happy and carefree. People say they live for the moment, but what they are really saying is they cannot face the future, and they have not resolved the past.</p>
<p>努力追求幸福只会自欺欺人，因为你会发现你自己为了维护这种快乐无忧的感觉，会否定你自己的体验以及周围的许多现实。人们说他们活在当下，但实际上他们无法面对未来，也无法放下过去。</p>
<p>For you have a relationship with the future and you have a relationship with the past, and to be able to be fully present in the moment, you must be present to whatever is really there. You cannot think: “I will only be present to those things that are pleasing to me, only those things that reassure me, only those things that meet my expectations.”</p>
<p>因为你与未来有关系，你与过去也有关系，为了能够完全活在当下，你必须活在真实存在的一切之中。你不能想：“我只会活在那些令我愉悦的事物之中，只会活在那些令我安心的事物之中，只会活在那些符合我期望的事物之中。”</p>
<p>That is not being present. And being present is the foundation of being able to experience love and affinity and compassion. If you cannot be present with your own experience, you really cannot be present with another’s experience.</p>
<p>那不是活在当下。而活在当下是体验爱、亲和力和同情心的基础。如果你无法活在你自身的体验中，你也无法活在他人的体验中。</p>
<p>If you say to life: “I only want to see the good. I only want to see the happiness. I only want to see the pleasant,” then you are not in relationship with life, for life includes a vast array of experiences.</p>
<p>如果你对生命说：“我只想看到美好的事物。我只想看到幸福。我只想看到愉快的事物”，那么你就没有与生命建立起关系，因为生命包含了丰富多彩的经历。</p>
<p>Being out of relationship with yourself, you will feel disconnected, you will not have any real confidence, you will not really know what you are capable of. You will not know your strengths and weaknesses clearly enough to discern them. It is a constant state of frustration, nervousness and anxiety.</p>
<p>失去与你自己的关系，你会感到与世隔绝，失去真正的自信，无法真正知道你的能力。你无法清晰地知道你的优势和劣势，也无法辨别它们。你会陷入持续的沮丧、紧张和焦虑之中。</p>
<p>Now happiness becomes a drug, and in many cases it is a drug. You take a drug to feel lighthearted, to feel creative, to feel energetic. You have lost your connection to the deeper Knowledge and awareness within yourself. And now the drug is there to relieve your pain and your anxiety. You have deep feelings, and they keep emerging, but you keep running from them.</p>
<p>如今，幸福变成了毒品，很多时候它本身就是一种毒品。你吸食毒品是为了感到轻松愉悦，感到富有创造力，感到精力充沛。你失去了与你自己内在更深层次的内识和觉知的联接。而现在，毒品的存在是为了缓解你的痛苦和焦虑。你拥有深刻的感受，它们不断涌现，但你却一直在逃避它们。</p>
<p>This leads to ever greater forms of avoidance and addiction. It is a fundamental problem in life. But God has given you a greater Intelligence, deeper within you. This greater Intelligence is strong. It is not conditioned by the world. It is not threatened by the world. It is fearless. It is capable. And it is wise. It represents a deeper Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>这导致了越来越严重的逃避和上瘾。它是生命中的一个根本问题。但上帝赋予了你一种更伟大的智能，它存在于你内在的更深处。这个更伟大的智能是强大的。它不受世界所制约。它不受世界所威胁。它无所畏惧。它有能力。它是明智的。它代表着你内在更深层次的内识。</p>
<p>To begin to take the Steps to Knowledge, to experience the power and the presence of Knowledge, is to rebuild an essential connection to the deeper current of your life.</p>
<p>开始开展内识的进阶，体验内识的力量和存在，​​就是重建与你生命中更深层次潮流的重要联接。</p>
<p>Along the way, you will have to face your pain, your anger, your unforgiveness. You will have to re-examine your former relationships and exercise recognition and forgiveness. You will have to face all those things that perhaps you were trying to avoid in the past, but you are doing this now to build a real connection inside of yourself.</p>
<p>一路走来，你必须直面你的痛苦、你的愤怒、你的不宽恕。你必须重新审视你过去的人际关系，行使承认和宽恕。你必须直面所有那些你过去或许试图回避的事情，但现在你这样做是为了在你内心建立一种真正的连接。</p>
<p>This makes you more open to others, more discerning of others, and more objective regarding your understanding of others. This brings you out of the shadows, out of the darkness of your own pain and avoidance. This leads you to a deeper happiness and a greater satisfaction.</p>
<p>这会让你对他人更加开放，更加明辨是非，也更加客观地理解他人。这会带你走出阴影，走出你自身痛苦和逃避的阴霾。这会引领你走向一种更深层次的幸福以及一种更伟大的满足。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you gives you the strength to face these things. And as you become closer to Knowledge, you will feel that a great strength lives within you, and that you are not weak or pathetic. This begins to erase any sense of low self-esteem. And it shows you that in your past, your mistakes, your errors in judgment, your miscalculations were all because you were not connected to this deeper Intelligence.</p>
<p>你内在的内识赋予你力量去面对这些。当你越来越接近内识时，你会感受到你内在蕴藏着一股伟大的力量，你并不软弱或可怜。这开始抹去任何自卑感。它向你展示，你过去犯下的错误、你的判断失误、你的误判，都是因为你没有连接到这个更深层次的智能。</p>
<p>Around you, you will see people trying to run away from themselves, trying to avoid things, and you will understand their predicament. You will not be so judgmental or condemning. You will think to yourself, “Oh, yes, I understand what that is like. I have lived in that state of mind before.”</p>
<p>在你周围，你会看到人们试图逃避他们自己，试图回避一切，你会理解他们的困境。你不会再那么评判或谴责。你会心想：“哦，是的，我理解那种感觉。我以前也经历过那种心灵状态。”</p>
<p>God rescues you because God gives you something important to do in life. And this important set of activities involves important relationships with others. It begins to erase all of the unforgiveness you have with yourself and other people. It restores to you your strength and sense of real direction in life, and reaffirms that you have come from your Ancient Home bearing gifts for the world, and these gifts are valuable and unique to you, and that you are uniquely designed to render them and to carry and express them.</p>
<p>上帝拯救你，因为上帝赋予你生命中一些重要的事情去做。而这一系列重要的活动涉及与他人的重要关系。它开始抹去你对你自己和他人的所有不宽恕。它恢复你生命中的实力和真正的方向感，并重申你来自你的古老家园，带着给世界的礼物，这些礼物对你来说是宝贵而独特的，你被独特地设计来呈现它们、承载和表达它们。</p>
<p>The deep pain of Separation from God and the deep pain of Separation from your own deeper nature here are erased.</p>
<p>与上帝分离的深深痛苦和与你自己更深层次自然的分离的深深痛苦在这里被抹去了。</p>
<p>Now life is just problematic, circumstantially difficult, occasionally very annoying, but within yourself, there is a deeper sense of rightness about your life. You are on the right track. You are not wandering aimlessly. You are not overcome with disappointment or agitation.</p>
<p>现在，生命充满问题，处境艰难，偶尔令人恼火，但在你自己内心深处对生命有一种更深层次的正确感。你走在正确的道路上。你没有漫无目的地徘徊。你没有被失望或焦虑所淹没。</p>
<p>The difficulties of life are circumstantial. They are less personal to you. You still have weaknesses and certain predispositions that you have to be careful with. You still have certain tendencies that you have to manage wisely. But fundamentally you have reconnected with your greater purpose for being here. And you are following that purpose step by step, allowing it to reveal itself to you as you proceed.</p>
<p>生命的困难是环境所决定的，它们对你来说不那么人性化。你依然有弱点和某些倾向需要小心应对。你依然有某些倾向需要明智地管理。但从根本上来说，你已经重新连接到你身处此地的更伟大目的。你正在一步步遵循那个目的，让它在你前进的过程中向你展现。</p>
<p>This takes great self-confidence and great trust. Here you do not have to constantly reassure yourself, or prove to yourself that you have value, or that you are intelligent, or that your life has meaning because these things will just be self-evident.</p>
<p>这需要伟大的信心和伟大的信任。在这里，你无需不断地安慰你自己，或向你自己证明你有价值，你很聪慧，或者你的生命有意义，因为这些事情将是不证自明的。</p>
<p>God rescues you by giving you something important to do in life. This really is the healing, you see, because you were sent to the world to give something very unique to meet a real need in the world. And if you are fulfilling this mission and allowing it to reveal itself to you step by step, then you are satisfying the deepest need of your soul.</p>
<p>上帝通过赋予你生命中重要的事去做来拯救你。你看，这才是真正的疗愈，因为你被派到这个世界，是为了给予一些非常独特的礼物来满足这个世界真正的需求。如果你正在履行这个使命，并让它一步步地向你展现，那么你就是在满足你灵魂最深层的需求。</p>
<p>Whatever limitations you have within yourself, whatever little irritations you have with life, whatever disappointments you may encounter along the way, nothing can erase this sense of rightness that you are really doing what you came here to do. This produces a happiness and a satisfaction that is deep and abiding.</p>
<p>无论你自己有何局限，无论你在生命中遇到多少小烦恼，无论你一路上遭遇多少失望，都无法抹去你真正在做你来此要做的事的这种正确感。这会产生一种深刻而持久的幸福和满足。</p>
<p>That does not mean that you are laughing all day long. It does not mean that every moment is pleasant. It does not mean that you are carefree. But it does mean that you are connected, that you are really connected to why you came here and to who you are. And you are beginning to be connected to the people in life you really need to know and to meet.</p>
<p>这并不意味着你整天都在欢笑。这并不意味着你每时每刻都快乐无比。这并不意味着你无忧无虑。但这确实意味着你被联接了起来，你真正地与你为何而来到这里、与你是谁相连接。你开始与生命中你真正需要知道、需要遇见的人建立了联系。</p>
<p>This undoes the source of your suffering, which is all the result of being separated or disconnected from your true nature, from your Creator, and from your real purpose for being here. If you have this disconnection, then no amount of pleasure or stimulation can erase the profound sense of loneliness and discontent that you will feel with you and carry everywhere with you.</p>
<p>这能化解你痛苦的根源，而这痛苦全都源于你与你的真实自然、与你的造物主以及你身处此地的真正目的分离或断绝。如果你与此隔绝，那么无论多少快乐或刺激都无法抹去你内心深处的孤独与不满，它们将伴随你左右，并始终伴随着你。</p>
<p>You could live a life of ease, a life without overarching demands, and you would still be restless—pacing like a caged animal, back and forth, unable to sit still with yourself, unable to be with anyone else fully and completely—restless, agitated, confused.</p>
<p>你可以过着一种轻松的生活，一种没有过多要求的生命，但你仍然会焦躁不安——就像笼中的动物一样来回踱步，无法静静地坐着，无法全心全意地与任何人相处——焦躁不安、焦虑不安、困惑不已。</p>
<p>God gives you the escape from these things by giving you something important to do and to know and to experience. Then you can learn to be serious and lighthearted all at once. At first, this seems like a contradiction. How could you be serious and lighthearted all at once? For anything that seems serious would be something you could not be lighthearted about. So it seems like a contradiction at the outset.</p>
<p>上帝让你逃避这些事情，是给你一些重要的事情去做、去知道、去体验。这样你就能学会同时严肃和轻松。乍一看，这似乎是矛盾的。你怎么能同时严肃和轻松呢？因为任何看起来严肃的事情，你都无法轻松对待。所以，这乍一看似乎是矛盾的。</p>
<p>But when you begin to experience that you are taking your life seriously, that you are seriously evaluating what you really need to do, when you are really beginning to reconnect with the deeper current of your life and your greater purpose for coming here, which is a serious pursuit, then you begin to feel a kind of lifting of an oppression within yourself.</p>
<p>但是当你开始体验到你在认真对待你的生命，你在认真评估你真正需要做什么，当你真正开始重新联接你生命更深层次的潮流以及你来到这里的更伟大目的——这是一种认真的追求——那么你开始感受到你内在的一种压抑正在解除。</p>
<p>The darkness in your mind begins to lift, like the fog burning off in the morning sun. And when that fog begins to diminish, you are able to see and feel and know things that were too clouded before for you to experience.</p>
<p>你心灵中的黑暗开始消散，就像晨曦中弥漫的雾气开始消散。当雾气开始消散，你就可以看见、感受到、并知道那些之前因阴云密布而无法体验的事物。</p>
<p>People in the world, if they are wealthy enough, go to great lengths to have experiences of pleasure or happiness. They go to great lengths to try to feel connected to themselves in certain ways. They travel around the world, they climb mountains, they do extreme sports, they involve themselves in their hobbies and their interests to extreme degrees, trying to have some kind of deeper experience.</p>
<p>世上的人，如果足够富裕，就会竭尽全力去体验快乐或幸福。他们会竭尽全力，试图以某种方式与他们自己建立联系。他们周游世界，攀登高山，进行极限运动，将他们的爱好和兴趣投入到极致，试图获得某种更深层次的体验。</p>
<p>They are spending their lives, they are spending their fortunes, they are using the resources of the world to try to have an experience that they could have if they could learn to sit still, every day.</p>
<p>他们倾尽一生，倾尽财富，使用世间的资源，试图获得一种只要学会每天静坐就能获得的体验。</p>
<p>Sitting still requires that you be with yourself and your experience. It requires that you see the restlessness of your mind and face all of the influences that you have allowed into your mind. It shows you your discontent. It shows you your lack of self-discipline and lack of focus in your life.</p>
<p>静坐需要你与你自己和你的经历相处。它需要你正视你心灵的躁动，并直面所有你允许进入你心灵的影响。它展现出你的不满。它展现出你缺乏自律，缺乏生命的焦点。</p>
<p>This takes tremendous courage. You are going to face whatever is within you in order to reach a deeper current of your life. This is a serious pursuit. But when you begin to experience the deeper current of your life, then there is a relief and a lightheartedness.</p>
<p>这需要极大的勇气。为了触及你生命中一种更深层次的潮流，你将直面内心的一切。这是一个严肃的追求。但当你开始体验生命深处的洪流时，你就会感到轻松自在，心情愉悦。</p>
<p>You do not have to go around constantly searching and asking: Who am I? Why am I here? What must I really do in life? Because now you are beginning to experience the deeper current of your life, where these things are simply felt and known. You do not have to go out and try to define your life, create your life, set immense goals for your life, or try—with immense effort and great frustration—to carve out a reality for yourself.</p>
<p>你不必四处奔波，不断探寻并询问：我是谁？我为何在此？我生命中究竟必须做什么？因为现在你开始体验你生命更深层次的潮流，在那里，这些事情被简单地感受和知道。你不必走出去，试图定义你的生命，创造你的生命，为你的生命设定极大的目标，或者试图——带着巨大的努力和巨大的挫折——为你自己雕琢一个现实。</p>
<p>For Knowledge within you is moving your life. It is carrying you in the direction you really must go. Here if you are involved in aggravating relationships, you will see that Knowledge will either take you into them or away from them. They are either meant to be a part of your greater journey or not, and this will bring tremendous resolution to your life.</p>
<p>因为你内在的内识正在推动你的生命。它正引领你走向你真正必须去的方向。在这里，如果你身处令人恼火的关系中，你将看到内识要么带你进入它们，要么带你远离它们。它们要么注定是你更伟大旅程的一部分，要么就不是，这将为你的生命带来极大的决心。</p>
<p>People are struggling to have things, or to be something, or to do things that really have nothing to do with who they are and why they are here. So no matter how much energy or resources they invest in these pursuits, they are never satisfying. No matter how much they give themselves to try to make their relationships functional, these relationships simply cannot come into fruition.</p>
<p>人们挣扎着想要拥有一些东西，想要成为某种人，想要做一些与他们的身份和存在意义毫不相关的事。所以，无论他们为这些追求投入多少精力和资源，都无法获得满足。无论他们付出多少努力去维持人际关系，这些关系都无法开花结果。</p>
<p>To be relieved of this hopeless attempt is a tremendous comfort to the soul. Now you do not have to try so hard. You do not have to win approval with others. You do not have to be beautiful or intelligent or charming or attractive to try to win the approval of others to get what you want.</p>
<p>摆脱这种无望的尝试，对灵魂来说是一种极大的安慰。现在你不必再那么努力了。你不必再去赢得别人的认可。你不必再漂亮、聪明、迷人或有吸引力，去努力赢得别人的认可，从而得到你想要的东西。</p>
<p>Here you see that relationships will come into your life as you are ready for them and as you take the Steps to Knowledge within yourself and follow the true movement of your life step by step. This is such a great relief, and this is what brings a sense of lightheartedness into your life.</p>
<p>在这里你看到，当你为它们做好准备，当你开展你自己内在的内识进阶，并一步步遵循你生命真正的进程时，关系将会进入你的生命。这真是一个伟大的解脱，这为你的生命带来了一种轻松感。</p>
<p>Here you are taking on the most serious and significant pursuit of your life, and yet inside you feel excited; you feel you have energy; there is a deep enthusiasm; there is a sense of rightness about your life. You are grateful to be free from your former pursuits, which could never bring you real satisfaction.</p>
<p>你正肩负着你生命中最严肃、最重要的追求，然而内心却激动不已；你感到精力充沛；你心中充满着深切的热情；你对你的生命充满了正确的感觉。你庆幸自己摆脱了之前的追求，它们永远无法给你带来真正的满足。</p>
<p>When you gain a greater vantage point in following this movement of Knowledge, you will look around you and people will seem like they are in chains, slavishly trying to have what they want and to avoid calamity, slavishly engaged with each other. And you will feel a kind of liberation within yourself, as if you have finally made a real connection, and your life is really moving, and it is moving in the direction it was destined to go.</p>
<p>当你在追随内识的这个运动中获得更伟大的视角时，你将环顾四周，人们似乎被锁链束缚着，奴性地试图得到他们想要的东西并逃避灾难，奴性地彼此交往。你将在你内在感受到一种解放，仿佛你终于建立了一种真正的连接，你的生命真正地在前进，它正朝着它注定要去的方向前进。</p>
<p>The seeming contradiction of being serious and lighthearted all at once now is recognized as a cause and effect. You are seriously engaged in what is really meaningful to you; the meaning is returned to you; you feel lighthearted and relieved and enthusiastic. You can give yourself wholeheartedly to this, for this is your real direction. You can give yourself wholeheartedly without a sense of betrayal, confusion or relentless anxiety.</p>
<p>严肃与轻松之间看似矛盾，如今却被理解为一种因果关系。你认真地投入到对你真正有意义的事情中；意义回归到你身上；你感到轻松、释然、热情洋溢。你可以全心全意地投入其中，因为这才是你真正的方向。你可以全心全意地投入，而不会感到背叛、困惑或无尽的焦虑。</p>
<p>Giving yourself to things that have no future can only generate constant confusion and frustration. To be free of these things is an immense gift. It is a gift to yourself, and it is a gift to the world. For this will free you to find your real contribution to others, and that will give you a satisfaction that is unparalleled in the world.</p>
<p>把你自己交给那些没有未来的事情，只会导致持续的困惑和挫败。摆脱这些事情是一份极大的礼物。这是给你自己的一份礼物，也是给世界的一份礼物。因为这将使你自由地发现你对他人的真正贡献，这将赋予你一种世间无与伦比的满足感。</p>
<p>People are struggling to be happy, to be free, to have relationships, but if their life is moving in the wrong direction, if they are not going where they really need to go or doing what they really need to do, then they are unhappy, they are frustrated, they are agitated, they are constantly discontented. You see the evidence all around you. It is the tragedy of the rich. It is a tragedy of the world.</p>
<p>人们努力追求幸福、自由、建立人际关系，但如果他们的生命方向错误，如果他们没有去真正该去的地方，或者没有做真正该做的事情，他们就会不快乐、沮丧、焦虑，并持续感到不满。你身边随处可见这样的证据。这是富人的悲剧，也是世界的悲剧。</p>
<p>Everyone has been given the gift of Knowledge. Everyone is here for a purpose. But when you look around, you do not see the evidence of this, except perhaps in only a few individuals. It is the tragedy of living in Separation.</p>
<p>每个人都被赋予了内识的礼物。每个人来此都是为了一个目的。但当你环顾四周时，你看不到这一点的证据，或许除了少数几个人。这是生活在分离中的悲剧。</p>
<p>But God has put Knowledge within each person, as the source and the power of their redemption. Then God does not have to manage your life, for God has set a beacon within you that will guide you to your greater contribution in the world. It is like a real inner compass, from which you can navigate your life effectively, regardless of the confusion of events around you.</p>
<p>但上帝已将内识置于每个人的内在，作为他们救赎的源泉和力量。这样上帝就无需管理你的生命，因为上帝已在你内在设立了一座灯塔，它将指引你走向你在世界上的更伟大贡献。它就像一个真正的内在指南针，无论你周围事件多么混乱，你都能从中有效地指引你的生命。</p>
<p>As time goes on, events around you will become ever more confused as the Great Waves of change crash upon the world. There will be greater confusion, greater frustration, greater anger, greater dissonance in the world around you as humanity faces a world of declining resources, a world of violent weather, a world of ever greater political and economic instability, a world of increasing risk of conflict and war.</p>
<p>随着时间流逝，随着变革巨浪冲击世界，你周围的事件将变得越来越混乱。随着人类面对一个资源日益减少的世界，一个恶劣天气频发的世界，一个政治和经济日益动荡的世界，一个冲突和战争风险日益增加的世界，你周围的世界将出现更大的混乱、更大的挫折、更大的愤怒和更大的不和谐。</p>
<p>Here your former pursuit of happiness will become ever more threatened. Here the need for Knowledge becomes paramount. You need this inner compass. You need to re-engage with the deeper current of your life. You need to learn to still the mind so you can feel this deeper current and so that you can discern the right decisions to make, even if everyone around you is utterly confused.</p>
<p>在这里，你过去对幸福的追求将变得越来越受到威胁。在这里，对内识的需求变得至关重要。你需要这内在的指南针。你需要重新融入你生命更深层次的潮流。你需要学习静止你的心灵，这样你才能感受到这种更深层次的潮流，这样你才能辨识做出正确的决定，即使你周围的每个人都完全困惑。</p>
<p>This inner strength, this inner direction, this inner light, this inner navigation will be critical in the future, especially because the level of uncertainty will grow. And your life may have to take a thousand turns, which you cannot predict at this moment.</p>
<p>这种内在的力量，这种内在的方向，这种内在的光明，这种内在的导航在未来将至关重要，尤其是在不确定性不断增加的情况下。你的生命或许会经历千变万化的转折，而这些转折你此刻无法预测。</p>
<p>You may well wonder, “How will I know what to do? Where will I find the strength and the confidence?” Here even the Great Waves of change will bring you back to Knowledge, for only Knowledge can guide you through them.</p>
<p>你或许会疑惑：“我怎么知道该做什么？我在哪里能找到力量和信心？”在这里，甚至变革的巨浪也将带你回归内识，因为唯有内识能够指引你穿越它们。</p>
<p>Your ideas will not guide you through them. Your philosophy will not guide you through them. Your dependence upon authority figures in government or commerce or religion cannot guide you through them. These influences may be helpful or they may be disastrous, but essentially for you to find greater inner certainty and inner strength, you need the power and the presence of Knowledge. To make wise decisions in the face of great uncertainty, you need the Wisdom of Knowledge.</p>
<p>你的想法不会引导你度过这些困难。你的哲学不会引导你度过这些困难。你对政府、商业或宗教权威人物的依赖也无法引导你度过这些困难。这些影响或许有益，或许有害，但本质上，为了找到更伟大的内在确定性和内在力量，你需要内识的力量和存在。为了在巨大不确定性面前做出明智的决定，你需要内识的智慧。</p>
<p>Here happiness is not a form of escape. It is not being foolish and indulgent. It is not a form of self-betrayal or self-denial. It is not an addiction or a dangerous activity.</p>
<p>在这里，幸福不是一种逃避，不是一种愚蠢和放纵，不是一种自我背叛或自我否定，不是一种瘾症或危险的行为。</p>
<p>Here your life has a deeper connection, and you can soar at great heights because you have a deeper connection. You can face immense uncertainty in the world because you have a deeper connection. You can trust yourself when you do not know what to do because you have a deeper connection. And you will not give your life away to people or places or things because you have a deeper connection.</p>
<p>在这里，你的生命拥有一种更深层次的联接，你能够翱翔至更高的高度，因为你拥有一种更深层次的联接。你能够面对世界上巨大的不确定性，因为你拥有一种更深层次的联接。当你不知道该做什么时，你能够信任你自己，因为你拥有一种更深层次的联接。你不会将你的生命交付给任何人、任何地点或任何事物，因为你拥有一种更深层次的联接。</p>
<p>This freedom is unparalleled in the world. Even the rich cannot buy it. It cannot be purchased. It cannot even be assured by a government. It has unparalleled value to you.</p>
<p>这种自由在世界上是无与伦比的。即使是富人也买不到它。它无法被买卖。它甚至无法由政府来保证。它对你来说有着无与伦比的价值。</p>
<p>Your soul is yearning to have its mission discovered and fulfilled. You are looking, right now, for the real people and relationships you are going to need in the future. You are trying to find your real way even though perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places. You have an inner navigator that is trying to chart the course of your life but is only being held back by all of your plans and goals, schemes, attitudes and activities.</p>
<p>你的灵魂渴望它的使命被发现并实现。此刻，你正在寻找未来真正需要的人和关系。你正在努力寻找真正的道路，即使你或许一直在错误的地方寻找。你内心有一位导航员，它试图指引你的生命方向，但却被你所有的计划、目标、方案、态度和活动所阻碍。</p>
<p>That is why when you practice stillness, you put yourself in a position to receive. But you must be very patient here, for five minutes of stillness will not reveal the mystery and the direction of your life. For that, you will have to learn to be still more often, on a regular basis. You will have to learn the wisdom of discernment and discretion and many other things. But this is your essential education in life. There is nothing more important than this.</p>
<p>正因如此，当你练习静止时，你把你自己置于一个接收的位置。但你必须非常有耐心，因为五分钟的静心并不能揭示你生命的神秘和方向。为此，你必须学会​​更频繁、更规律地保持静心。你必须学习辨识力、判断力以及其他许多方面的智慧。但这是你生命中必不可少的教育。没有什么比这更重要。</p>
<p>This will teach you how to be in the world, who to choose to be in relationship with and how to be with them, where to go, what kind of work to do, how to live, where to live, what is valuable, what is not, what to become involved in and what not to become involved in and so forth.</p>
<p>这将教你如何在世界上生存，选择与谁建立关系以及如何与他们相处，去哪里，做什么样的工作，如何生活，住在哪里，什么是有价值的，什么是没有价值的，什么该参与，什么不该参与，等等。</p>
<p>This is a freedom that so few people have ever found. And this freedom creates a sense of well-being and rightness about your life that cannot be purchased or acquired in any other way.</p>
<p>这是一种很少有人能找到的自由。这种自由能让你对生命产生一种幸福感和正确感，这种感觉是任何其他方式都无法买到或获得的。</p>
<p>God’s Will for you is perfect happiness, but perfect happiness has to be a real happiness. It cannot be a happiness that is only born of personal preference or ideology. It has to be a deep sense of purpose and meaning in your life. It has to be an acknowledgment and an expression of your deeper nature.</p>
<p>上帝对你的意志是完美的幸福，但完美的幸福必须是真正的幸福。它不能是仅仅源于个人偏好或意识形态的幸福。它必须是你生命中深刻的目的和意义感。它必须是对你更深层次自然的一种认可和表达。</p>
<p>Here it is not dependent upon changing circumstances, or fleeting moments, or the wild and unpredictable nature of romance with others. It has a greater certainty and a greater strength and a greater duration. You can face anything now, for you know that a greater strength is within you.</p>
<p>在这里，它不依赖于变化的境遇，或转瞬即逝的时刻，或与他人浪漫的狂野和不可预测的自然。它拥有一种更伟大的确定性，一种更伟大的力量，一种更伟大的持久性。你现在能够面对任何事，因为你知道你内在有一种更伟大的力量。</p>
<p>You are freed from making foolish and life-determining mistakes because you are taking the time to look and to see, to feel and to know. You are not deceived now by beauty, wealth or charm. You will not give your life away for these things. This gives you strength and encouragement, confidence and a greater sense of presence and direction.</p>
<p>你不再犯下愚蠢且决定人生的错误，因为你花时间去看见、去感受、去知道。你现在不会被美貌、财富或魅力所蒙蔽。你不会为了这些东西而放弃你的生命。这赋予你力量、鼓励、自信，以及更强大的存在感和方向感。</p>
<p>This is the happiness that you really need, and it is born of taking the Steps to Knowledge, of re-experiencing and engaging yourself with the deeper current of your life. It is the result of allowing your greater purpose to reveal itself step by step, without you trying to define it, direct it or control it.</p>
<p>这是你真正需要的幸福，它源于开展内识进阶，源于重新体验并参与你生命更深刻的潮流。它是允许你的更伟大目的一步步展现它自身，而非你试图定义它、引导它或控制它的结果。</p>
<p>It creates a greater sense of trust in oneself and in the greater spiritual powers that are in the world. Yet this gives you the ability to face the tragedy and difficulty that you see all around you, without succumbing to these things.</p>
<p>它创造了一种对自我以及对世界上更伟大精神力量的更伟大的信任感。这同时也赋予你能力去面对你周围所见的悲剧和困境，而不会屈服于这些。</p>
<p>It is like you have to learn to be happy all over again, based upon a different approach, a different set of activities, a different understanding. It is like going back and starting all over again. Happiness 101. Fulfillment 101.</p>
<p>它就像你必须重新学习如何获得快乐，基于不同的方法、不同的活动、不同的理解。它就像回到过去，一切重新开始。幸福101。满足101。</p>
<p>Here your earlier and previous notions have to be challenged and set aside. And you have to allow yourself not to know what the answer is. Because you do not, not yet.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须挑战并摒弃你先前的观念。你必须允许你自己不知道答案是什么。因为你还不知道，至少现在还不知道。</p>
<p>This involves a deep evaluation of your life, a deep reconsideration of your life—who you are with, what you are doing, where you are going, where you have invested yourself, what is robbing you of energy, what is holding you back.</p>
<p>这涉及对你的生命进行深入的评估，对你的生命进行深入的重新思考——你和谁在一起，你正在做什么，你要去哪里，你把你自己投入到哪里，什么在消耗你的能量，什么在阻碍你。</p>
<p>Here you must be very specific. Here you have to question everything and allow confusion to arise while you go through this reconsideration. For you do not go from confusion to ultimate certainty in one step. Everything does not become clear in one moment.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须非常具体。在这里，你必须质疑一切，并在你重新思考的过程中允许困惑的出现。因为你不可能一步到位地从困惑走向最终的确定性。一切不可能在一瞬间变得清晰。</p>
<p>It is like taking a journey up a mountainside, a journey out of the valley and the woods below where you could not see where you were, you could not gain any sense of your surroundings, you did not have the lay of the land, you did not see the relationship of the features of the landscape.</p>
<p>它就像是在山腰上旅行，走出山谷和下面的树林，在那里你看不到你身在何处，无法感知周围的环境，你不了解地形，看不到地貌特征之间的关系。</p>
<p>It is to get you out of the woods and the valleys of your life to a higher vantage point where you can see clearly that really is the focus of spiritual practice. When you can see, you can know, and when you know, there is resolution. And when there is resolution, there is a freeing of your life.</p>
<p>它能带你走出生命的丛林和低谷，到达更高的观测点，在那里你能看清一切，这才是精神练习的真正意义所在。当你可以看见，你就可以知道；当你知道，你就能找到解决方案。当你有了解决方案，你的生命就能获得解脱。</p>
<p>Here happiness is not the goal; it is the result. You do not seek happiness for happiness’ sake, not if happiness is going to be real. You seek the deeper meaning and current of your life. You seek to know what to do next. You want Knowledge to guide you. This produces happiness and satisfaction. But here happiness and satisfaction are not the goal.</p>
<p>在这里，幸福并非目标；它是结果。你并非为了幸福而寻求幸福，除非幸福是真实的。你寻求你生命的更深层次的意义和潮流。你寻求知道下一步该做什么。你希望内识指引你。这带来幸福和满足。但在这里，幸福和满足并不是目标。</p>
<p>If people say, “Ah, I just want to be happy,” they are not really understanding what happiness is or how it can be achieved. If people say, “I just want to be at peace,” they do not realize yet they are here for a greater purpose, that they were sent into the world to do something, that God has given them something to do—to free them, to rescue them and to redeem them.</p>
<p>如果人们说：“啊，我只想快乐，”他们并没有真正理解快乐是什么，或者如何实现快乐。如果人们说：“我只想和平，”他们还没有意识到他们来此是为了一个更伟大的目的，他们被派到世界上去做某事，上帝赋予他们某事去做——解放他们，拯救他们，救赎他们。</p>
<p>Happiness is a consequence; it is a result of being truly engaged with your life as it was designed and as it was meant to be. Happiness is not a goal. Peace is not a goal. Like happiness, peace is the result of an inner resolution, a reconnection with your deeper nature and your true direction in life. It is a result, not a goal.</p>
<p>幸福是一种结果；它是你真正投入到你生命中，按照它被设计、按照它本该是的样子去生活的结果。幸福并非目标。和平并非目标。如同幸福一样，和平是内在决心的结果，是与你更深层次的自然以及你生命中真正方向的重新连接的结果。它是一种结果，而非目标。</p>
<p>If your goal is to find what you are really here to do and to engage yourself in that, that will produce peace and happiness for you because these are the result of an inner resolution, a reconnection, a rediscovery, a fundamental relationship.</p>
<p>如果你的目标是找到你真正要做的事情并全身心投入其中，那么这将为你带来和平与幸福，因为这些都是内在的决心、重新连接、重新发现和重要关系的结果。</p>
<p>Your values will change; your pursuits will change; your priorities will change. Instead of running around like a crazy person trying to have happiness and fun and excitement and constant stimulation, you will begin to settle down. You will not be driven by the fear of not having, by the fear of not finding. You will be able to settle down and become observant and wise, powerful and connected.</p>
<p>你的价值观会改变；你的追求会改变；你的优先事项会改变。你不再像疯子一样四处奔波，试图获得快乐、乐趣、兴奋和持续不断的刺激，而是会开始安定下来。你不再被没有的恐惧、找不到的恐惧所驱使。你将能够安定下来，变得敏锐、明智、强大、善于交际。</p>
<p>This will cast you apart from other people. It will distinguish you. It will give you a different journey to take. But this is entirely appropriate and is worth so much more than any difficulties that might arise, or any challenges you have to face along the way.</p>
<p>这会让你与众不同，让你与众不同，让你踏上一段与众不同的旅程。但这完全合情合理，远比你一路上可能遇到的任何困难或必须面对的任何挑战更有价值。</p>
<p>God is drawing you like a magnet. Knowledge is alive within you. It is counseling you every day. You have to leave the restless surface of your mind to find the quiet depths. Here stillness becomes not emptiness, but a luxury, a grace, a power and a presence. And this is what you seek for in all things.</p>
<p>上帝像磁铁一样吸引着你。内识在你内心深处鲜活地存在。它每天都在指引你。你必须离开你心灵躁动的表面，才能找到宁静的深处。在这里，静止不再是空虚，而是一种奢侈，一种恩典，一种力量，一种存在。而这正是你在一切事物中寻求的。</p>
<p>Therefore, begin to take the Steps to Knowledge. Feel the deeper need of your soul. Begin the deep evaluation. Receive God’s New Message that provides you the pathway and the opportunity to experience this in everyday life, in all your circumstances, no matter who you are or where you are or what your predicaments might be.</p>
<p>因此，开始开展内识进阶。感受你灵魂更深层次的需求。开始深入评估。接收上帝的新讯息，它为你提供在日常生命中、在你所有境遇中体验这一点的途径和机会，无论你是谁，无论你身在何处，无论你的困境如何。</p>
<p>God has rescued you because God has given you something important to do. You must find this and take the journey this will require, and the deep re-evaluation of your life this will require, and the deep resolution that this will give you as a result.</p>
<p>上帝已经拯救了你，因为上帝赋予你一件重要的事情去做。你必须找到它，踏上它所要求的旅程，深刻地重新评估你的生命，并最终获得它所赋予你的深刻决心。</p>
