<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on August 26, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 8 月 26 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God’s greatest providence to humanity is the power and presence of Knowledge that has been given to each individual. For the God of the entire universe cannot be preoccupied with human affairs, or with the affairs of any one individual. Yet God speaks to each person and has created a deeper conscience within each person. And God’s Will can flow through Knowledge within each person. It is a miracle beyond human comprehension. It is beyond the grasp of the intellect.</p>
<p>上帝赋予人类最伟大的天意，是赋予每个人内识的力量和存在。因为整个宇宙的上帝不可能专注于人类事务，或任何个体的事务。然而，上帝与每个人对话，并在每个人内在创造了一种更深层次的良知。上帝的意志能够通过每个人内在的内识流淌。它是一个超越人类理解的奇迹。它超越了智力的掌握。</p>
<p>Yet there are other forces in life who support God’s Purpose. There are Spiritual Powers in the universe who support God’s Will and Purpose. For you not only have Knowledge within yourself to guide you, to protect you and to prepare you for living a greater life in the world, but you also have Teachers, who are part of the Angelic Host who watch over your progress and who, at certain times, will give you insights and send ideas into your mind to assist you and to encourage you to follow your conscience—the deeper conscience that God has placed within you.</p>
<p>然而生命中还有其他力量支持着上帝的宗旨。宇宙中存在着精神上的力量，它们支持着上帝的意志和宗旨。因为你不仅拥有你内在的内识来指引你、保护你并让你为在世界上过上更伟大的生命进行准备，而且你还有老师，他们是天使圣团的一部分，他们守护着你的进步，并在某些时候，他们会赋予你洞察力，并将想法发送到你的心灵之中，以协助你并鼓励你遵循你的良知——上帝放置在你内在的更深层次的良知。</p>
<p>Your Teachers will not reveal themselves to you. That only happens under very rare circumstances. For you cannot become preoccupied with your Teachers. You cannot become obsessed with them because if you do you lose sight of what you must accomplish here in the world and your own responsibilities. It is more important to keep your eyes focused outward, but with the power and the presence of Knowledge moving you.</p>
<p>你的老师不会向你显现。这只会在非常罕见的情况下发生。因为你无法专注于你的老师。你无法沉迷于他们，因为如果你这样做，你就会忽视你在此世必须完成的事情以及你自己的责任。更重要的是，保持你的目光聚焦于外在，但让内识的力量和存在推动你。</p>
<p>The fact that you have Teachers watching over you and others is very significant. However, do not think that you yourself have your own set of Teachers, as if you have your own personal guiding angels, because that is not the case at all. What is true here is that those who are your Teachers, who are members of your Spiritual Family who have been assigned to watch over you, also watch over many others.</p>
<p>有老师照看着你和其他人是非常重要的。但是，不要认为你有你自己的老师，就好像你有你自己的守护天使，因为事实并非如此。真正的情况是，你的老师们，你精神家庭的成员，受命守护着你，同时也守护着许多其他人。</p>
<p>It is as if they are gardeners, and you are but one of the plants that they are cultivating and watching. They are not with you at every moment. They are not standing by your side. They are not available every time you call. They are like traveling doctors in the countryside who must travel over long distances to see their patients. But if you call for them, or if you call for guidance, or if you ask for the truth to be revealed and you ask this with great sincerity, then they will respond.</p>
<p>他们就像园丁，而你只是他们培育和照料的植物之一。他们并非时时刻刻与你同在。他们并非站在你身边。你每次呼唤他们，他们也并非随时待命。他们就像乡村里的流动医生，必须长途跋涉才能为病人诊治。但如果你呼唤他们，如果你寻求指引，如果你真诚地祈求真理的揭示，他们将会回应。</p>
<p>How they respond will be determined by your nature and your level of development. Perhaps an idea will come into your mind. Perhaps you will have a feeling or see an image. Perhaps you will have a strong sense that something must be done or that something must be avoided. In many cases, this is your Teacher speaking to you. But, of course, at the level of your own awareness, this could be very difficult to discern, for you have many motivations in your mind.</p>
<p>他们如何回应将取决于你的自然和你的发展水平。也许一个想法会涌入你的心灵。也许你会有一种感觉，或者看到一个画面。也许你会强烈地感觉到必须做某事，或者必须避免某事。在很多情况下，这是你的老师在对你说话。但是，当然，在你自身的觉知层面上，这可能很难辨别，因为在你的心灵中有很多动机。</p>
<p>Do not think that any deep feeling comes from Knowledge. Do not think that any creative thought comes from your Teachers. Until you can gain a higher position on the mountain of life and see the panorama more clearly, then it will be difficult, and even impossible, to really tell the difference. But there is a difference.</p>
<p>不要认为任何深刻的感受都来自内识。不要认为任何创造性的思想都来自你的老师。除非你能在生命之山上获得更高的位置，更清晰地看清全景，否则你将很难，甚至不可能真正分辨出其中的区别。但两者之间确实存在区别。</p>
<p>What Knowledge indicates for you has a consistency to it. It is not dependent upon your moods or feelings or emotions or the circumstances of your life, particularly. If you have known you need to do something and you have not done it, the feeling will continue every time you re-experience it.</p>
<p>内识为你指引的事情具有一致性。它尤其不依赖于你的情绪、感受、情感或你的生命境遇。如果你知道你需要做某事，但却没有去做，那么每次你重新体验它时，这种感觉都会持续下去。</p>
<p>It does not vacillate. It does not change, whereas your desires are always shifting. They are moving from one thing to another. Even if you are obsessed with a person or a situation, it is still very temporary. It is the calmness and the consistency of Knowledge that is one of its hallmarks, that distinguishes it from all the other forces and ambitions and persuasions in your mind.</p>
<p>它不会动摇。它不会改变，而你的欲望总是在变化。它们从一件事转移到另一件事。即使你痴迷于一个人或一个情况，它仍然是非常短暂的。内识的平静和一致性是它的标志之一，使它区别于你心灵中所有其他的驱动力、野心和说服。</p>
<p>People often associate conscience with guilt. They have experienced having a guilty conscience. Because of this association, people may want to avoid the whole area of conscience altogether, because of this association, because they do not want to feel guilty. They do not want to suffer.</p>
<p>人们常常把良心和内疚联系在一起。他们经历过内疚。正因为这种联系，人们可能想要完全避开良心，正因为这种联系，因为他们不想感到内疚，不想受苦。</p>
<p>While it is true if you do something that violates your nature or that goes against Knowledge, yes, you will feel guilty, but really here it is a sign that you are moving in the wrong direction. It is a flag that comes up to tell you that you are about to make a serious mistake. It is a protection for you.</p>
<p>虽然如果你做了违背你自然或违背内识的事情，你的确会感到内疚，但实际上，这是你正朝着错误方向前进的征兆。它是一面升起的旗帜，告诉你即将犯下严重错误。它是对你的一种保护。</p>
<p>And, of course, when you are doing something that really is right for you, and that resonates with Knowledge deep within you, then you will feel good, you will feel lighthearted, you will feel strong, and you will experience your own integrity. These are all referring to a deeper conscience within you, the conscience of Knowledge.</p>
<p>当然，当你在做一件真正适合你的事情，并与你内在深处的内识产生共鸣时，你会感觉良好，你会感到轻松，你会感到强大，你会体验到你自身的完整性。这些都指向你内在一种更深层次的良知，内识的良知。</p>
<p>This is very different from the kind of conscience that your own social conditioning has created. If you do not follow the mannerisms of your culture, you feel guilty. Well, that is a conscience that is created by your culture and has nothing to do with Knowledge within you, or the deeper conscience of Knowledge that God has placed within you to be your guide and beacon. If you do not follow the social customs of your tribe or nation, and you feel awkward and uncomfortable and guilty, this is not about Knowledge.</p>
<p>这和你自身社会条件所创造的那种良知截然不同。如果你不遵循你文化的习俗，你会感到内疚。嗯，那是一种由你的文化所创造的良知，与你内在的内识无关，也与上帝置于你内在作为你的指引和灯塔的内识的更深层次良知无关。如果你不遵循你部落或国家的社会习俗，你感到尴尬、不适和内疚，这与内识无关。</p>
<p>But if you do something harmful to yourself or to others, or if you do something that violates your deeper nature and you feel discomfort and guilt, that does have to do with Knowledge. That is Knowledge telling you: “Do not do this. This is not right for you or for others.” This goes far beyond whatever your social conditioning has dictated to you over time. It is an entirely different experience.</p>
<p>但如果你做了一些伤害你自己或他人的事情，或者你做了一些违背你更深层次自然的事情，并感到不适和内疚，那确实与内识有关。那是内识在告诉你：“不要这样做。这对你或他人都是不对的。”这远远超越了你的社会熏陶长期以来强加给你的一切。它是一种完全不同的体验。</p>
<p>Those Teachers who are assigned to you are part of the Angelic Host, but they have great responsibilities. They are watching over hundreds of individuals. They are not your personal attendants. You cannot abide with them whenever you want. They do not sit on your shoulder all day long and whisper into your ear.</p>
<p>那些被指派给你的老师是天使群体的一部分，但他们肩负着伟大的责任。他们守护着数百人。他们不是你的私人侍从。你无法随时与他们同在。他们不会整天坐在你的肩上，对着你耳语。</p>
<p>There are many fanciful notions about angels—thinking that angels are lovely little women, who float around shooting arrows of love into the hearts of people, that angels are ethereal and gentle and feminine and sweet.</p>
<p>关于天使有很多奇妙的想法——认为天使是可爱的小女人，四处飘荡，向人们的心中射出爱之箭，认为天使是空灵、温柔、有女人味、甜美的。</p>
<p>This is a fantasy, completely. Your angels are both male and female—are powerful, are strong, are forceful. They can be very confronting to you. They are not always gentle; they do not always seem to be kind and reassuring. If you want a babysitter, well, then you will have to use your imagination, but the reality of your Teachers is something else entirely.</p>
<p>这完全是幻想。你的天使既有男性也有女性——强大、坚强、强势。他们有时与你格格不入。他们并不总是温柔；他们并不总是看起来善良、令人安心。如果你想找个保姆，那你就得发挥你的想象力了，但现实中你的老师们却完全是另一回事。</p>
<p>You will not experience them directly, except under very rare circumstances and facing very rare situations. You may never have any experience directly of who they are because they cannot become your focus. If you fall in love with your Teachers, you will not be able to function in the world; you will not attend to your duties and responsibilities here adequately. And your imagination will begin to conjure up conversations with your Teachers, images and messages from your Teachers—and before you know it, you are creating a whole reality for yourself that has nothing to do with the reality of life.</p>
<p>你不会直接体验到它们，除非在非常罕见的情况下，面对非常罕见的境况。你可能永远无法直接体验到它们是谁，因为它们无法成为你的焦点。如果你爱上你的老师，你将无法在世上正常运作；你将无法充分履行你在此的职责和责任。你的想象力将开始召唤出与你老师的对话，来自你的老师的形象和信息——在你知道之前，你就为你自己创造了一个与生命现实毫不相关的完整现实。</p>
<p>Yet at this moment, it is important to know that you have powerful support, but this support will not encourage you to do things that go against Knowledge within yourself. Your Teachers are not here to give you what you want, to fulfill your desires and ambitions, to cushion you against all of life’s difficulties, to spare you from the consequences of your errors.</p>
<p>然而此刻，重要的是要知道你拥有强大的支持，但这种支持不会鼓励你去做违背你内在内识的事情。你的老师们在此并非为了给予你想要的东西，并非为了满足你的渴望和野心，并非为了缓冲你所有生命中的困境，并非为了免除你犯下的错误所带来的后果。</p>
<p>You may want wealth and beauty, comfort and reassurance, but your Teachers are not here to give you these things. What they provide is what is essential for your mission and your journey in life.</p>
<p>你或许渴望财富、美貌、舒适与安心，但你的老师并非为了给予你这些东西而存在。他们所提供的正是你的使命和生命旅途中必不可少的内识。</p>
<p>Their reassurance is for this purpose. Their counsel is for this purpose. They are here to support you in recognizing and experiencing and expressing your greater purpose for coming into the world. That is their only focus.</p>
<p>他们的保证就是为了这个目的。他们的建议也是为了这个目的。他们在此支持你认知、体验并表达你来到这个世界的更伟大目的。这是他们唯一的关注点。</p>
<p>If you want them to give you other things, then you will be disappointed. And if you think they are giving you other things, then you can be sure that it is your imagination you are following, and not the reality of your Teachers.</p>
<p>如果你希望他们给你其他东西，那你肯定会失望。如果你以为他们给你的是其他东西，那你肯定是在追随你的想象，而不是你老师的现实。</p>
<p>It is important to see the Angelic Host, whom you will encounter and experience, as Teachers and not simply as comforters or those who will create miracles for you. When people rely on miracles, something is missing. Either their situation has become hopeless, or they are not really taking responsibility for the actions that they must take. And so they have given up, and now must rely upon miracles. Very poor people rely on miracles because they have no social power, because they cannot effect any significant change in their environment.</p>
<p>重要的是，要将你将会遇到和体验的天使群体视为老师，而不仅仅是安慰者或为你创造奇迹的人。当人们依赖奇迹时，他们似乎缺少了一些东西。要么他们的处境变得无望，要么他们没有真正承担起他们自己必须采取的行动的责任。于是他们放弃了，现在必须依赖奇迹。非常贫困的人依赖奇迹，因为他们没有社会力量，因为他们无法对自身环境产生任何重大的改变。</p>
<p>The real miracle is the power and the presence of Knowledge within you. Your Teachers are here to encourage and promote your developing a connection and a relationship with Knowledge as the foundation of your life, as the source of your certainty and direction.</p>
<p>真正的奇迹是你内在内识的力量和存在。你的老师们在此鼓励和促进你发展与内识的联接和关系，将其作为你生命的基础，作为你确定性和方向的源泉。</p>
<p>Your Teachers are not here to take the place of this, and that is why you cannot become so reliant upon them, thinking to yourself, “Oh, my Teachers told me this,” and “My Teachers told me that,” and “My Teachers are guiding me here,” and “My Teachers are guiding me there.” If you begin to think like this, then you are really missing the point.</p>
<p>你的老师们并非来取代这一切的，因此你不能过于依赖他们，心里想着：“哦，我的老师们告诉我这个”，“我的老师们告诉我那个”，“我的老师们正在引导我到这里”，“我的老师们正在引导我到那里”。如果你开始这样想，那么你就真的错过了重点。</p>
<p>It is Knowledge within you that must become strong. And you must become strong and competent, and wise and discerning, to receive the power and the presence of Knowledge, and to carry it successfully in the world, in a world where Knowledge is unknown and is not respected.</p>
<p>你内在的内识必须变得强大。你必须变得强大、有能力、智慧、有辨识力，才能接收内识的力量和存在，并在世界上成功地承载它，在一个内识不为人所知、不被尊重的世界上。</p>
<p>That is why your Teachers cannot be the emphasis. You cannot bypass your fundamental responsibility and become reliant upon a spiritual force to guide you and to counsel you and to protect you.</p>
<p>正因如此，你的老师不能成为重点。你不能回避你的根本责任，依赖某种精神力量来指引你、劝告你、保护你。</p>
<p>Do not think you have a guardian angel that is always with you, watching over you, as if you were a little child and it was like your mother or your father. For your real Teachers have many responsibilities and many individuals to watch over.</p>
<p>不要认为你有一个守护天使时刻陪伴着你，就像你小时候那样，守护着你的父母。因为你真正的老师肩负着许多责任，需要照顾许多人。</p>
<p>It is as if you were all babies in a vast nursery, and they were watching over all of you to see how you were doing and coming along, and giving individuals encouragement when that is needed. But never think that your Teachers will replace Knowledge as a source of power and guidance in your life, for that will only be confusing and will mislead you.</p>
<p>你就像是一个在巨大的育婴室里的婴儿，他们照看着你们所有人，观察你们做得怎么样、进步如何，并在需要的时候给予每个人鼓励。但千万不要认为你的老师会取代内识成为你生命中的力量和指引之源，因为那只会让你困惑，误导你。</p>
<p>There are many forces beyond your visible range. There are presences that you cannot touch, but who you can feel. You can feel the presence of your Teachers, and that is one of the indications that they are near you. But they will not come too close to you because if they do, their presence would overwhelm you, and that could frighten you and even terrify you. They will remain at a distance because they are powerful, far more powerful than you are at this moment.</p>
<p>在你的视野范围之外，存在着许多力量。有些存在你无法触及，但你却能感受到。你能感受到你老师们的存在，这是他们在你身边的迹象之一。但他们不会离你太近，因为如果他们这样做，他们的存在会让你感到压倒，这可能会让你感到恐惧，甚至惊恐。他们会保持距离，因为他们强大，远比此刻的你强大。</p>
<p>You cannot have a love affair with them. You cannot project onto them everything you really need from other people, or you will not recognize your real responsibilities here.</p>
<p>你不能和他们有恋爱关系。你不能把你真正需要从别人那里得到的一切投射到他们身上，否则你将无法认识到你在这里的真正责任。</p>
<p>Your Teachers are mentoring you but at a distance, careful not to come too close or to exert too great an influence over you. It is true they may speak directly into your mind at times of great crisis or decision, but these are rare occurrences. You have an intrinsic connection with your Teachers. Even if they are far away and not in your proximity, it is as if you have a line of communication to them always.</p>
<p>你的老师们会指导你，但你们之间保持着一定的距离，他们小心翼翼地避免与你过于亲近，也避免对你施加过大的影响。诚然，在重大危机或抉择时刻，他们或许会直接对你进行心灵的启迪，但这种情况并不常见。你与你的老师之间有着内在的联系。即使他们远在天涯，不在你身边，你也仿佛始终与他们保持着沟通的渠道。</p>
<p>And yet, as in so many other things, people have much confusion and misunderstanding regarding the Angelic Presence. People claim that their Teachers or their angels have told them this or guided them to do that, but you would really have to use a deeper discernment to tell the truth from the falsity in these claims.</p>
<p>然而，正如在许多其他事情中一样，人们对天使存在有着许多困惑和误解。人们声称他们的老师或天使告诉过他们这件事，或引导过他们那样做，但你真的需要更深层次的洞察力才能辨别这些说法中的真伪。</p>
<p>That is why it is better not to tell other people about your experiences of your Teachers. It is extremely personal and is meant for you, perhaps only your spouse or partner, or someone who has been a longstanding student of Knowledge with whom you are closely aligned—only then would it be appropriate to talk about your experiences. This should never be part of a casual conversation, and you should never reveal these experiences to a stranger.</p>
<p>正因如此，最好不要告诉别人你与老师的经历。这极其私人，只适合你，或许只适合你的配偶或伴侣，或者某个与你紧密契合的长期内识学习者——只有这样，谈论你的经历才是合适的。这绝不应该成为随意交谈的一部分，你也绝不应该向陌生人透露这些经历。</p>
<p>When you do this, you lose part of the power and the potency of your initial experience. Do not use this as a way of connecting with other people, or impressing other people, or even trying to help other people. Because in truth, whatever experiences you have had with the presence of the Teachers still remain mysterious and beyond definition. If you treat it in a casual way, it loses mystery and power for you, and you lose reverence for it.</p>
<p>当你这样做时，你会失去最初体验的部分力量和潜能。不要以此作为与他人联系、给他人留下深刻印象，甚至试图帮助他人的方式。因为真理是，无论你与老师们共处时经历过什么，它们仍然是神秘莫测、难以言喻的。如果你漫不经心地对待它，它对你来说就会失去神秘感和力量，你也会失去对它的敬畏。</p>
<p>Therefore, be discreet. Do not share your deeper experiences casually with anyone. Save that for people with whom you have a deep and longstanding bond, people who can really appreciate the nature of this deeper experience and contact.</p>
<p>因此，务必谨慎。不要随意与任何人分享你更深层次的体验。请将这份分享留给那些与你有着深厚而长久联系的人，那些能够真正体会这种更深层次体验和联系自然的人。</p>
<p>Complicating this situation even further is the extraterrestrial presence in the world today, which is trying to speak into people’s minds—trying to disguise itself as spiritual agents, as enlightened beings, as redeemers for humanity.</p>
<p>使这种情况变得更加复杂的是当今世界上的外星存在，他们试图向人们的心灵发表意见——试图将它自己伪装成精神导师、开悟者、人类的救赎者。</p>
<p>If they have access to your mind, they will project thoughts and images into your mind because that represents power in the mental environment. That is their power, the power of persuasion. They do not have military power; they cannot use force in the world, and so they rely upon influence. And for individuals that they have captured, whom they have turned to their purpose, they will have immense influence.</p>
<p>如果他们能够进入你的心灵，他们就会将思想和图像投射到你的心灵中，因为这代表着心理环境中的力量。那是他们的力量，说服的力量。他们没有军事力量；他们无法在世界上使用武力，因此他们依靠影响力。对于那些被他们俘获、被他们转向他们目的的个体，他们将拥有巨大的影响力。</p>
<p>This is why the New Message from God emphasizes the power and presence of Knowledge because Knowledge is the only part of you that cannot be deceived, that cannot be manipulated, and that cannot be controlled by any force—be it worldly or from beyond the world.</p>
<p>正因为如此，来自上帝的新讯息强调内识的力量和存在，因为内识是你唯一无法被欺骗、无法被操控、无法被任何力量控制的部分——无论是世俗的还是来自世界之外的。</p>
<p>You do not yet realize the importance of Knowledge. It is not merely a source of wise counsel for you. It is not merely a part of yourself that is reliable and that can see clearly. It represents your safety and your security in the face of opposing forces that have immense power of influence over the minds of so many people in the world today.</p>
<p>你尚未意识到内识的重要性。它不仅仅是你明智忠告的一个源泉。它不仅仅是你自己可靠且能够清晰洞察的一部分。它代表着你在面对那些对当今世界如此众多人的心灵有着巨大影响力的反对力量时的安全和保障。</p>
<p>Living in physical reality is living in an environment of opposing forces. Therefore, it is necessary to gain maturity in being able to discern these forces and to distinguish them effectively. If you follow everything that comes into your mind, you will be a slave to other forces, and your life will be one calamity after another.</p>
<p>生活在物质现实中，就意味着生活在一个充满对立力量的环境中。因此，你必须成熟地辨别这些力量，并有效地区分它们。如果你对心灵中浮现的一切念念不忘，你就会成为其他力量的奴隶，你的生命将充满一场又一场的灾难。</p>
<p>It is discerning what you will think about, it is carefully choosing what you will do and who you will be with, and what forms of action and what activities you will involve yourself in. Here you must bring great clarity and objectivity to your own experience, which is something that very few people have done. Your Teachers will support you in this, for this is fundamental.</p>
<p>它在于辨别你将思考什么，它在于谨慎地选择你将做什么、你将与谁相处，以及你将参与哪些形式的行动和活动。在这里，你必须将伟大的清晰性和客观性带入你自身的体验，这是很少有人做到的。你的老师们会在这方面支持你，因为这是根本。</p>
<p>Do not then clamor for miracles or tell yourself that you are being guided in all things, for that is a fool’s assumption. In fact, operating in life at this time is functioning in an environment with many hazards and many difficult choices. There are many influences, both human and otherwise, that could easily lead you astray, encouraging activities and associations that would be very harmful to you and that would distance you from your own power and your own discernment from Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>那么，不要再高呼奇迹，也不要再告诉你自己，你正在所有事情上受到指引，因为那只是愚蠢的臆断。事实上，此刻在生命中运作，是在一个充满诸多危险和诸多艰难抉择的环境中运作。有很多影响，无论是人为的还是其他的，很容易将你引入歧途，鼓励那些对你非常有害的活动和交往，那些会让你远离你自身的力量，远离你自己对内在内识的辨识。</p>
<p>It is not that you should be fearful in entering the world, but cautious and discerning, watchful and as objective as you can be. This is what the animals do because they realize that their environment has hazards, both hazards and opportunities. The same is true for individuals, for people everywhere. Rich or poor, there are hazards. The poor have many hazards that are much closer at hand, that are part of their daily experience. But the wealthy have other kinds of hazards, which are more difficult to discern and more subtle in nature.</p>
<p>这并不意味着你应该对进入这个世界感到恐惧，而是应该谨慎、敏锐、警觉，并尽可能保持客观。动物就是这样做的，因为它们意识到周围的环境充满危险，既有危险，也有机遇。对于个人，对于世界各地的人们来说，情况也是如此。无论贫富，都有危险。穷人面临的许多危险近在咫尺，是他们日常生活的一部分。但富人面临的则是其他类型的危险，这些危险更难辨别，也更微妙。</p>
<p>Governments try to influence you, religions try to influence you, commercial interests try to influence you, your family tries to influence you, even the Intervention from races from beyond the world may well focus upon you and try to influence you.</p>
<p>政府试图影响你，宗教试图影响你，商业利益试图影响你，你的家庭试图影响你，甚至来自世界以外种族的干预也可能会关注你并试图影响你。</p>
<p>How can you possibly think clearly in such an environment of influence? How could you make a wise decision when there so many forces pulling you to make other decisions?</p>
<p>在如此充满影响力的环境中，你怎么可能清晰地思考？当有那么多力量在推动你做出其他决定时，你怎么可能做出明智的决定？</p>
<p>These are important questions, and they come back to the fundamental problem. The fundamental problem is that you are not yet connected to Knowledge, and so you are therefore subject to the whole range of influences in your environment, and to the power and persuasion of the social conditioning that has been drilled into your mind since the day you were born.</p>
<p>这些都是重要的问题，它们回归到根本问题。根本问题是你尚未联接内识，因此你受制于你所处环境的各种影响，受制于自你出生那天起就被灌输到你心灵中的社会熏陶的力量和说服。</p>
<p>You will be a slave to these forces, and are already, until you can gain access to Knowledge and secure your liberation, for Knowledge is not bound by any of these things. And Knowledge is immune from even the most powerful persuasions in the universe.</p>
<p>你将会成为这些力量的奴隶，而且已经如此，直到你能够触及内识并获得你的解放为止，因为内识不受任何这些事物的束缚。而且内识甚至不受宇宙中最强大的说服力的影响。</p>
<p>It is part of God within you. But it does not think like your mind thinks. It does not compare and contrast. It does not judge and evaluate. It does not criticize and condemn. Knowledge within you moves towards certain things and away from others, without condemnation.</p>
<p>它是上帝在你内在的一部分。但它的思考方式与你的心灵不同。它不比较、不对比。它不评判、不评价。它不批评、不谴责。你内在的内识会趋向某些事物，远离其他事物，却不带任何谴责。</p>
<p>Your Teachers are here to help you build a bridge from your worldly mind to the deeper Mind that God has placed within you. That is the purpose of your Teachers. Whatever counsel they may give you over time, however often you may experience their presence in your life, it is for this purpose: to counteract the negative forces and influences of the world around you and to support you building a deeper connection. Or, said in other words, to help you get up the mountain of life so that you can see the truth, beyond the tops of the trees. Beyond the obstruction of the landscape, you can rise high enough up to see clearly.</p>
<p>你的老师们在此，是为了帮助你搭建一座桥梁，连接你世俗的心灵与上帝赋予你内在的更深层次的心灵。这就是你老师们的使命。无论他们随着时间的推移给予你什么样的忠告，无论你在生命中多么频繁地感受到他们的存在，他们的使命都是为了这个：抵消你周围世界的负面力量和影响，并支持你建立更深层次的连接。或者换句话说，帮助你攀登生命之山，让你能够看到树梢之外的真理。超越风景的阻碍，你能够攀登到足够高的高度，看得更清楚。</p>
<p>This is Providence, to have Knowledge within you and to have the presence of the Teachers is providential. But, like all things in this world, it must be clarified. For anything sacred and profound becomes adulterated in the world. It becomes associated with other things. It becomes corrupted by people’s ambitions, people’s desires, people’s fear and aggravations. That is why there must be a constant clarification.</p>
<p>这就是天意，拥有内在的内识，并拥有老师们的存在，这本身就是天意。但如同世间万物一样，它必须被澄清。因为任何神圣而深刻的事物在世间都会被玷污。它会与其他事物联系在一起。它会被人们的野心、欲望、恐惧和恼怒所腐蚀。正因如此，必须不断进行澄清。</p>
<p>It is like cleaning your clothes. You have to keep doing it, or they become dirty and unfit for you to wear. That is why your spiritual understanding has to go through constant cleaning, or it accumulates the dirt of the world, the corruption of people’s perceptions, the corruption of your own misunderstanding.</p>
<p>它就像洗衣服一样。你必须持续清洗，否则衣服会变脏，不适合你穿。正因如此，你的精神理解必须不断清洗，否则它会积聚世俗的污垢、人们认知的腐败以及你自身误解的腐化。</p>
<p>You have to keep cleaning the mirror, or you will not be able to see yourself. You have to keep cleaning your windows, or you will not be able to see out of them with any degree of accuracy. You have to keep clarifying and purifying your spiritual awareness and understanding because of the corruptive powers of the world, and now even the corruptive influences of those races from the universe who are here to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity.</p>
<p>你必须持续擦拭镜子，否则你将无法看清你自己。你必须持续擦拭窗户，否则你将无法透过窗户准确地看到外面。你必须持续澄清和净化你的精神觉知和理解，因为这个世界充斥着腐败的力量，现在甚至还有来自宇宙的种族的腐败影响，他们来此是为了利用脆弱而分裂的人类。</p>
<p>You are living in a world of opposing forces. That is what distinguishes physical life from your Ancient Home, from which you have come and to which you will return. That is a reality where there are no opposing forces. But here in the world, there are opposing forces, and you must discern them correctly. Here it is important not to study evil, for evil is seductive and loves to be studied.</p>
<p>你生活在一个充满对立力量的世界里。这正是物质生命与你古老家园的区别所在，你来自那里，也将回归那里。那是一个没有对立力量的现实。但在此世，存在着对立力量，你必须正确地辨识它们。在这里，重要的是不要研究邪恶，因为邪恶具有诱惑力，并且喜欢被研究。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you will indicate what is valuable and what is not, what is safe and what is not, who to go with and who not to go with, what to invest yourself in and what not to invest yourself in.</p>
<p>你内在的内识会告诉你什么是有价值的，什么是没有价值的，什么是安全的，什么是不安全的，该和谁一起去，不该和谁一起去，该在什么上投资，不该在什么上投资。</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, you would be attracted by certain things. You would be intrigued by certain things. You would be drawn to other things. You would become attached to people and to places and to possessions that do not represent your real destiny and purpose in the world. And you could spend a lifetime trying to fulfill yourself through these people, these places or these things, without any chance of success. Such is the tragedy of human experience.</p>
<p>没有内识，你会被某些事物吸引。你会被某些事物所好奇。你会被其他事物所吸引。你会对那些并不代表你在世间真正天命和目的的人、地方和财产产生依恋。你可能会花费一生的时间，试图通过这些人、这些地方或这些事物来充实你自己，却没有任何成功的机会。这就是人类体验的悲剧。</p>
<p>The pathway is difficult because there are so many other attractions, and there are so many other compelling forces appealing to your desires and to your fears—attracting you with charm, beauty and wealth, or terrifying you with violence and evil intent.</p>
<p>这条路很难走，因为有太多其他的吸引力，有太多其他的强制性力量在吸引你的欲望和恐惧——用魅力、美貌和财富吸引你，或用暴力和邪恶意图恐吓你。</p>
<p>Only Knowledge can keep you focused on the pathway you must follow, and your Teachers are here to help guide you to do this, and to provide extra assurance and to provide the reality that you are not alone in your greater mission in life.</p>
<p>只有内识能够让你专注于你必须遵循的道路，而你的老师们在这里是为了帮助指导你做到这一点，并提供额外的保证和现实，让你知道在你更伟大的生命使命中，你并不孤单。</p>
<p>Even if there is no one else with you in this, even if you have not found yet your real allies in life, those who will share a greater purpose and mission with you, you have your Teachers because you are not alone. God would not send you into such a difficult environment without great assistance. You have this great assistance.</p>
<p>即使没有其他人与你同在，即使你尚未找到你生命中真正的盟友，那些将与你共享更伟大目的和使命的人，你也有你的老师，因为你并不孤单。上帝不会在没有伟大援助的情况下将你送入如此艰难的境地。你拥有这个伟大的援助。</p>
<p>To experience the presence of your Teachers, you must learn to become still and observant. You must quiet your mind and learn how to focus your mind. Become sensitive to your environment, and to the presences that fill that environment, whether these presences have a physical form or not. You must develop a greater sensitivity and a greater discernment.</p>
<p>要体验老师的存在，你必须学会​​静心观察。你必须静下心来，学习如何集中注意力。对周围的环境以及充斥其中的种种存在变得敏感，无论这些存在是否有形体。你必须培养更敏锐的敏感度和更敏锐的辨识力。</p>
<p>The New Message from God has provided the training in Steps to Knowledge to enable you to build this sensitivity and awareness. It is very important. Without this, you will be driven by your fears and desires and pulled along by the intentions of others, swept along in the tide of human obsession and human compulsion.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息提供了内识进阶的训练，使你能够构建这种敏感度和觉知。这非常重要。没有它，你将被你的恐惧和渴望所驱使，被他人的意图所牵引，被人类痴迷和人类冲动的潮流所席卷。</p>
<p>You are not alone in your greater journey. You have powerful Spiritual Forces to assist you, but they can only assist you if you are moving in the right direction. They can only give you what they are sent here to give you, not to give you what you want or what you may desire of them.</p>
<p>在你更伟大的旅程中，你并不孤单。你拥有强大的精神力来协助你，但只有当你朝着正确的方向前进时，它们才能协助你。它们只能给予你它们被派来此地要给予你的东西，而不是给予你想要的或你可能向它们祈求的东西。</p>
<p>They represent a greater set of relationships, both within and beyond this world, that represents your Spiritual Family, your working group. Your Teachers are senior members of your Spiritual Family. They have already completed their work in manifest reality. Now they must dedicate themselves to assisting those who remain behind. They have climbed the mountain that you must climb. Now they must come down and help the others up.</p>
<p>他们代表着一套更伟大的关系，既在这个世界之内，也在世界之外，这套关系代表着你的精神家庭，你的工作小组。你的老师是你精神家庭的资深成员。他们已在显化现实中完成了他们的工作。现在他们必须奉献他们自己去帮助那些留下的人。他们已经攀登​​了你必须攀登的高山。现在他们必须下来，帮助其他人上去。</p>
<p>Once you have achieved greatness, you must contribute your greatness to others. Once you have fulfilled your mission in physical reality, you must assist others who are trying to find theirs. This is part of God’s Plan. It is a Plan that affects life throughout the universe, in all dimensions, in all realities.</p>
<p>一旦你成就了伟大，你必须将你的伟大贡献给他人。一旦你在物质现实中完成了你的使命，你必须帮助那些正在努力寻找他们使命的人。这是上帝计划的一部分。这个计划影响着整个宇宙、所有维度、所有现实的生命。</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not like you become enlightened, and you go to God, and you live in God for eternity in a state of ecstasy. No. Once you develop the appropriate skills and awareness and have graduated from a life of conflict and opposing forces, then you must serve others who remain behind.</p>
<p>因此，它并不意味着你开悟了，就走向上帝，在狂喜中永远活在上帝之中。不是的。一旦你发展出适当的技能和觉知，并摆脱了充满冲突和对立力量的生命，你就必须服务那些留在你身后的人。</p>
<p>It will not be something that is adverse to your nature to do this. It will be entirely natural. In fact, Knowledge within you will indicate this because this is part of your responsibility to Creation itself.</p>
<p>这样做并不会违背你的自然。它将是完全自然的。事实上，你内在的内识会指示这一点，因为这是你对创造本身的责任的一部分。</p>
<p>Your Teachers know what being in manifest life is like. They know the difficulties and the trials. They recognize the opposing forces. They understand your own tendencies that could lead you to acquiesce to these opposing forces. They understand your nature and your temperament, your strengths and your weaknesses.</p>
<p>你的老师深知显化生命是怎样的。他们知道其中的艰难和考验。他们辨识出那些对立的力量。他们知道你自身的倾向，这些倾向可能导致你默许这些对立的力量。他们知道你的自然和你的气质，你的优势和你的弱点。</p>
<p>They amplify for you the power and presence of Knowledge because fundamentally Knowledge is what unites you in relationships. And though you may not yet be aware of it, you are already united with your Teachers. You do not have to build a relationship with them. You only have to build an awareness of the relationship that already exists.</p>
<p>它们为你放大了内识的力量和存在，因为从根本上说，内识正是在关系中将你们团结在一起的东西。尽管你可能还没有察觉到这一点，但你已经与你的老师们团结在一起了。你不必与他们建立关系。你只需要建立对已经存在的关系的觉知。</p>
<p>This relationship will not be about hobbies and interests and the distinctions of personalities. It will not be about all the trivial things upon which people build their sense of themselves and their associations with others.</p>
<p>这种关系与爱好、兴趣和人格差异无关，也与人们构建自我意识和与他人交往的所有琐碎事物无关。</p>
<p>This bond is deep and intrinsic. It has purpose, meaning and direction and therefore serves as a template for how you must establish your deeper relations with others in the world—with other people and with the world itself. In this, your Teachers serve as a demonstration of what true relationship really is—a relationship that is built upon purpose and power and accomplishment in life.</p>
<p>这种联结是深刻而内在的。它拥有目的、意义和方向，因此它成为你如何与世界上的其他人——与其他人以及与世界本身——建立更深层次关系的一个模板。在这里，你的老师示范了真正的关系究竟是什么——一种建立在目的、力量和生命成就之上的关系。</p>
<p>Here the affinity is deep, the recognition is complete. It is deep and complete for your Teachers but not yet for you. For you have not gained the skill and the desire for the truth and the discernment and awareness yet to realize that you are not alone in the world, and that you have come here for a greater purpose.</p>
<p>在这里，亲和力是有深度的，认知是完整的。对于你的老师而言，它是深厚而完整的，但对你而言还不是。因为你尚未获得技能和对真理的渴望，以及辨识力和觉知，从而认识到你并非孤身一人，你来此是为了一个更伟大的目的。</p>
<p>Your Teachers will remain mysterious. Do not think that you can describe them. Do not give them names and describe their personality and their features because this is your imagination. Even if they gave you their names, they would remain mysterious because if they are mysterious, they can have greater influence, and provide greater assistance to you.</p>
<p>你的老师们将保持神秘。不要认为你能描述他们。不要给他们起名字，也不要描述他们的性格和特征，因为这只是你的想象。即使他们告诉你他们的名字，他们也依然保持神秘，因为如果他们保持神秘，他们就能对你产生更伟大的影响，并给予你更伟大的帮助。</p>
<p>They are not part of your circle of friends. You do not have a casual relationship with them. You do not have a superficial relationship with them. They are very serious in their intent. They take their relationship with you very seriously. They are committed to it. They are clear about its purpose and function and its value. It is their intention that over time that you will regard this relationship in the same way, and that you will build relationships with other people that have these fundamental qualities, and that your life will not be a trivial pursuit, but a deep and meaningful engagement.</p>
<p>他们并非你朋友圈的一部分。你和他们之间并非一种随意的关系。你和他们之间并非一种肤浅的关系。他们有着非常严肃的意图。他们非常认真地对待他们和你的关系。他们致力于此。他们清楚它的目的、功能和价值。他们希望随着时间的推移，你将以同样的方式看待这段关系，你将与其他拥有这些基本特质的人构建关系，你的生命将不再是一种琐碎的追求，而是一种深刻而有意义的参与。</p>
<p>In reality, there are no chosen people. God does not favor one group over another. God does not bless one and deprive another. Many people pray for things that would deprive other people. They pray for these things without realizing this. “God, give me these things that I want. Give me wealth and comfort.” But they have no awareness that their prayer might actually deprive other people or create great difficulty elsewhere, beyond their awareness; that they want from life things that could upset the balance of life and cause great distress elsewhere for others.</p>
<p>在现实中，没有所谓的选民。上帝不会偏袒任何群体。上帝不会祝福一个人而剥夺另一个人。许多人祈求的事物，却会让其他人失去。他们祈求这些东西却没有意识到这一点。“上帝，请赐予我我想要的东西。给我财富和舒适。”但他们没有觉知，他们的祷告实际上可能会剥夺其他人，或在他们觉知不到的其他地方制造巨大的困难；他们想要从生命中得到的东西，可能会扰乱生命的平衡，并在其他地方给他人带来巨大的痛苦。</p>
<p>Certainly, if your life is in danger, you call out for help. Certainly, if you are facing real deprivation, you ask for assistance and for support. Certainly, if a loved one is in danger, you ask for protection and for renewal for that person. If your nation is facing threat of aggression, you pray for peace and for restraint. These are all genuine requests, and they are served by the Angelic Presence.</p>
<p>当然，如果你的生命处于危险之中，你会呼救。当然，如果你正面临真正的匮乏，你会请求援助和支持。当然，如果你所爱之人身处险境，你会祈求保护，祈求他&#x2F;她重获新生。如果你的国家正面临侵略威胁，你会祈求和平与克制。这些都是真诚的请求，天使的存在会满足它们。</p>
<p>Service to humanity and to all other races in the universe is carried out by the Angelic Presence that is assigned to their respective worlds. That is why your notion of angels, and even of Heaven, is so ridiculously limited to a human reality that you cannot really conceive of it accurately.</p>
<p>对人类以及宇宙中所有其他种族的服务，是由被指派到各自世界的天使存在执行的。正因如此，你们对天使，甚至对天堂的理解，如此荒谬地局限于人类的现实，以至于你们无法真正准确地理解它。</p>
<p>Heaven is full of foreigners. Would that still be Heaven for you if it was filled with other beings who did not even look like you? Or would that make you feel uncomfortable, arousing suspicion and judgment and prejudice within you? It is not like every race gets to have its own unique Heaven, where there is a Heaven for human beings, and then there is a Heaven for all these other races, millions and millions of Heavens.</p>
<p>天堂里满是外来生命。如果天堂里全是长得和你不一样的生物，那对你来说还是天堂吗？还是说，那会让你感到不舒服，在你的内心激起怀疑、评判和偏见？并不是每个种族都有它自己独特的天堂，人类有天堂，其他种族也有天堂，千千万万个天堂。</p>
<p>That is why the journey before you is great and long. Even beyond this life, it continues. It is building the capacity for ever-greater dimensions of relationship, for what is Heaven but the ultimate dimension of relationship? If you can barely have a relationship with yourself, if you struggle to have a relationship with anyone else, well, clearly you do not have the capacity yet to be in your Ancient Home fully.</p>
<p>正因为如此，你面前的旅程伟大而漫长。甚至超越这个生命，它仍在继续。它构建着对更伟大维度关系的能力，因为天堂不就是关系的终极维度吗？如果你几乎无法与你自己建立关系，如果你挣扎于与他人建立关系，那么，显然你还没有能力完全进入你的古老家园。</p>
<p>God is not going to wave a wand over you and dissolve your limitations because God did not create your limitations. It is you who must outgrow them over time—through many circumstances, through great service, and through the accumulation of real wisdom.</p>
<p>上帝不会挥动魔杖就消除你的局限，因为上帝并没有创造你的局限。你必须随着时间的推移，通过各种境遇、通过伟大的服务以及通过积累真正的智慧来超越它们。</p>
<p>The journey is great. Many people think if you are a good boy or a good girl you go to Heaven. If you are bad, you go to Hell, and that is it. But this is completely ignorant. You have no idea what returning to your Ancient Home really means and what it would require of you.</p>
<p>旅程是伟大的。很多人认为，如​​果你是个好孩子，你就能上天堂。如果你是个坏孩子，你就会下地狱，仅此而已。但这完全是无知的。你根本不知道回归你的古老家园究竟意味着什么，也不知道它需要你付出什么。</p>
<p>If you still desire to live in Separation, if you still want to be a distinct and separate individual, God is not going to come and destroy that. Even though it ultimately is the path of suffering and disassociation, God is not going to destroy that. And so until you can reclaim relationship into yourself and take the long and many-faceted journey this will require, then you will outgrow this need to be separate and apart. And that will prepare you for your Ancient Home. It is a great journey of return. Certainly, it does not end with this life. This life is only a chapter in a much greater story.</p>
<p>如果你依然渴望生活在分离之中，如果你依然渴望成为一个独特而分离的个体，上帝不会来摧毁它。即使这最终是一条通往苦难和解离的道路，上帝也不会摧毁它。因此，直到你能够重新找回与你自己之间的关系，并踏上这需要的漫长而多面向的旅程，你才会超越这种分离与分离的需求。这将为你的古老家园做好准备。这是一段伟大的回归之旅。当然，它不会在这个生命结束。今生只是一个更伟大故事中的一个篇章。</p>
<p>Humanity’s understanding of religion and God is necessarily very limited. Humanity knows nothing of the Greater Community of life in which you have always lived. It thinks of God in terms of human values, human images, human behavior and human qualities. Certainly, that is limited within the greater context of life in the universe.</p>
<p>人类对宗教和上帝的理解必然非常有限。人类对自己一直生活其中的生命大社区一无所知。它以人类价值观、人类形象、人类行为和人类品质来思考上帝。当然，这在宇宙生命更广阔的背景下是有限的。</p>
<p>If God is the Author of all life in the universe, then clearly you are dealing with a God that is not limited to human qualities and human values. And if Heaven includes all of Creation, and if the separated includes everyone living in manifest life in the universe, then it is a much bigger picture, you see. It is no longer a child’s story.</p>
<p>如果上帝是宇宙中所有生命的创造者，那么你面对的上帝显然不局限于人类的品质和价值观。如果天堂涵盖了所有创造，如果分离者涵盖了宇宙中所有显化的生命，那么你看，它是一个更宏大的图景。它不再是一个儿童故事。</p>
<p>To cross over the threshold from being simply living in one world—with one God, one Heaven, one Hell—to emerging into a Greater Community awareness is an immense threshold of understanding. It is entering an entirely new paradigm of experience, a paradigm of experience you cannot exhaust. It is like growing from being a child to being an adult.</p>
<p>跨越从仅仅生活在一个世界——只有一位上帝、一个天堂、一个地狱——到迈入大社区觉知的门槛，是理解的极大门槛。它意味着进入一个全新的体验范式，一个你无法穷尽的体验范式。它就像从一个孩子成长为一个成年人。</p>
<p>The journey before you is great and long, with many stages and many chapters. Each is necessary and significant. But this should not concern you now, for your mission is to establish a foundation in this world—a stable foundation built upon the Pillar of Relationships, the Pillar of Work, the Pillar of Health, and the Pillar of Spiritual Development—the Four Pillars of your life. The New Message from God reveals what these Four Pillars mean and how they can be cultivated.</p>
<p>你面前的旅程伟大而漫长，包含许多阶段和篇章。每一个都是必要且重要的。但现在你不应该为此担忧，因为你的使命是在这个世界上建立一个基础——一个建立在关系支柱、工作支柱、健康支柱和精神发展支柱——你生命的四大支柱——之上的稳定基础。来自上帝的新讯息揭示了这四大支柱的含义以及如何培育它们。</p>
<p>You are here for a greater purpose. It is this purpose you must begin to discern and to discover, to experience and to express. And that will require many stages and many changes in your life. This will require relationships of a higher nature, relationships that represent your higher purpose. It will require you developing a deep and profound connection with Knowledge and to be able to receive the counsel of your Teachers so that you may make progress, and so that you may not be pulled away or obstructed by the opposing forces in this world.</p>
<p>你来此是为了一个更伟大目的。正是这个目的，你必须开始辨识和发现，去体验和表达。这将需要你生命中的许多阶段和许多改变。这将需要一种更高自然的关系，一种代表你更高宗旨的关系。这将需要你发展与内识的一种深度联接，并能够接收你老师的辅导，这样你就能取得进步，这样你就不会被这个世界上的反对力量拉走或阻碍。</p>
<p>Providence is in you and with you and all around you—waiting to be experienced, waiting to be followed, waiting for you.</p>
<p>天意就在你心中、与你同在、在你周围——正等待着你去体验、正等待着你去追随、正等待着你。</p>
