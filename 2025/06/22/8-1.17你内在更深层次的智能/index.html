<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 23, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 10 月 23 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You were born with a deeper Intelligence, an Intelligence that is fundamental to your nature and to your Being. It is an Intelligence that is not directly connected to your physical body. It is an Intelligence you had before you came into the world. And it will be an Intelligence you have after you have left this world. It is an Intelligence quite unlike your intellect.</p>
<p>你生来就拥有一个更深层次的智能，一种构成你自然和你存在之根本的智能。这种智能与你的物质身体并无直接关联。这种智能在你来到这个世界之前就已拥有。在你离开这个世界之后，你仍将拥有这个智能。这个智能与你的智力截然不同。</p>
<p>Your intellect has been conditioned by the world, by your environment, by your decisions and the decisions of others. It represents many of the beliefs, prejudices and mythology of your culture and of your time. It is the product of your experience in the world thus far.</p>
<p>你的智力一直受到世界、你的环境、你的决定以及他人的决定的制约。它代表着你的文化和时代的许多信仰、偏见和神话。它是你迄今为止在世界上的经历的产物。</p>
<p>But there is a deeper Intelligence within you that existed before your intellect. It is connected to the deeper Intelligence of the universe, called God.</p>
<p>但在你的内在，存在着一种更深层次的智能，它存在于你的智力之前。它与宇宙中更深层次的智能相连，被称为上帝。</p>
<p>You may think of it in many different ways, but it cannot be defined. Its boundaries cannot be delineated by the intellect. You may associate it with ideas from your religious teachings and tradition, but in essence it defies definition. For it is not merely a thing or an idea. It is a presence and an experience, a power and a movement in your life.</p>
<p>你或许可以用许多不同的方式来思考它，但它无法被定义。它的边界无法被智力所划定。你或许会将它与你宗教教义和传统中的想法联系起来，但本质上它无法被定义。因为它不仅仅是一个事物或一个想法。它是你生命中的一种存在、一种体验、一种力量和一种运动。</p>
<p>God has given you this deeper Intelligence to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to a greater life in the world, a life that will enable you to fulfill your greater purpose for coming here.</p>
<p>上帝赋予你这个更深层次的智能来指引你、保护你并引领你走向世界上的一种更伟大生命，这个生命将使你能够实现你来到此地的更伟大目的。</p>
<p>This deeper Intelligence is so unlike your worldly mind. It does not deliberate. It does not fantasize. It does not speculate. It does not judge and condemn. It does not debate. It is not confused. It is not driven by fear and insecurity, desire and fantasy. It is deep and quiet. It is like the depth of the ocean.</p>
<p>这个更深层次的智能如此不同于你的世俗心灵。它不深思熟虑。它不幻想。它不推测。它不评判和谴责。它不辩论。它不困惑。它不受恐惧和不安全感、欲望和幻想的驱使。它深邃而宁静。它如同海洋的深度。</p>
<p>You live at the surface with your surface mind. That is where your awareness is. But the surface is only the surface. Beneath the surface of your mind is a deeper Mind—a profound Mind, a Mind where you are connected to life, a Mind that has a greater purpose for being in the world, a Mind that is not afraid of change. It is not even afraid of death. It is quiet. It is watchful. It is the center and source of your integrity, your strength and your true direction in life.</p>
<p>你带着你的表面心灵生活在表面。这是你的觉知所在。但表面仅仅是表面。在你心灵的表面之下是一个更深层次的心灵——一个深邃的心灵，一个你与生命联接的心灵，一个拥有存在于世的更伟大目的的心灵，一个不惧怕改变的心灵。它甚至不惧怕死亡。它是安静的。它是警觉的。它是你的完整性、你的力量以及你生命中真正方向的中心和源泉。</p>
<p>In essence, all religions were intended to bring you to Knowledge, for this is where God can influence you and where your relationship with God exists already. This is where God is not merely a grand concept or a faraway Being. This is a relationship that defies definition.</p>
<p>本质上，所有宗教都旨在带你走向内识，因为这是上帝能够影响你的地方，也是你与上帝的关系早已存在的地方。在这里，上帝不仅仅是一个宏大的概念或遥远的存在。这是一种无法定义的关系。</p>
<p>That is why The Way of Knowledge has been threatening to religious institutions that base their existence on doctrines and ideology, human obedience and human allegiance because if you encourage people to connect with Knowledge within themselves, who knows what they will do? You cannot harness them or corral them. They will not march in step to your orders. They will not be obedient to your precepts. Only in the mystical traditions of each religious tradition will you see an emphasis on this profound experience of knowing and resonance.</p>
<p>正因为如此，内识之路一直威胁着那些将其存在建立在教义和意识形态、人类服从和人类效忠之上的宗教机构，因为如果你鼓励人们与他们内在的内识联接，谁知道他们会做什么？你无法驾驭他们或圈养他们。他们不会按照你的命令步调前进。他们不会服从你的训诫。只有在每个宗教传统的神秘传统中，你才能看到对这种深刻知道和共鸣体验的强调。</p>
<p>God is now presenting through a New Message a deeper understanding of human spirituality at the level of Knowledge. This idea is not entirely new, but it has never been properly clarified.</p>
<p>上帝如今正通过一条新讯息，在内识层面上呈现对人类精神性的一种更深层次的理解。这个想法并非全新，但却从未得到过恰当的阐释。</p>
<p>People do not realize that God has planted a deeper Intelligence within them. For God is not managing your daily affairs. God is not controlling the winds and the weather. God is not the author of everything that happens to you or to everyone else. God has created a self-maintaining and self-regulating system of life. God is not controlling the flight of the butterfly or the movement of the ants or the migrations of the birds.</p>
<p>人们没有意识到上帝在他们内在放置了一种更深层次的智能。因为上帝并非掌管着你的日常事务。上帝并非掌控着风和天气。上帝并非你或其他所有人身上发生的一切的创造者。上帝创造了一个自我维持和自我调节的生命系统。上帝并非掌控着蝴蝶的飞翔，蚂蚁的移动，或是鸟类的迁徙。</p>
<p>God has sent you into a world that is very chaotic, a world where anything can happen to you, where events occur, some of them driven by forces you cannot even understand. God is not controlling the movement of the planets or the rising of the sun. That was all set in motion so very long ago before the idea of time was ever created, set in motion to be self-regulating, to be evolutionary, a system and set of systems that will run themselves, where life could evolve according to a pattern of increasing complexity and diversification.</p>
<p>上帝把你送进了一个非常混乱的世界，一个任何事情都可能发生在你身上的世界，一个事件发生的世界，其中一些是由你甚至无法理解的力量驱动的。上帝并没有控制行星的运动或太阳的升起。这一切都在很久以前，在时间的概念被创造出来之前就已启动，被启动以自我调节，进化，一个系统或一系列系统将自我运行，在那里生命能够按照一种日益复杂和多样化的模式进化。</p>
<p>God does not want to be burdened with managing all of this. It is set in motion. And that is why the world is so chaotic and difficult to survive in and to adapt to.</p>
<p>上帝不想承担管理这一切的重担。一切都已启动。正因如此，这个世界才如此混乱，难以生存，难以适应。</p>
<p>So for you to be here, you must have an intellect that is capable of sophisticated problem solving. You must have a marvelous physical body that is capable of functioning in this complex and ever-changing environment. But you need Knowledge to keep you connected to the Source of your life and to those who sent you into the world.</p>
<p>因此，为了你能够来到这里，你必须拥有一种能够解决复杂问题的智力。你必须拥有一个能够在这个复杂且不断变化的环境中运作的非凡身体。但你需要内识来保持你与你生命的本源以及与那些派遣你来到这个世界的存在的联接。</p>
<p>It is like the deep-sea diver. Yes, they are under the water. Yes, they are wearing their diving suit. But there is a lifeline that is connecting them to the surface. And Knowledge is like the lifeline that is connecting you to the surface.</p>
<p>它就像深海潜水员。是的，他们在水下。是的，他们穿着潜水服。但有一条生命线将他们与水面连接起来。而内识就像这条生命线，将你与水面连接起来。</p>
<p>It is as if you went into a deep cavern, a maze of tunnels, unmapped, unknown, seemingly going on forever. But there is a thread that you have carried with you so that you could find your way back. That is like Knowledge, you see?</p>
<p>仿佛你走进一个深邃的洞穴，一座隧道迷宫，没有地图，无人知晓，似乎永无止境。但你身上却带着一条线索，指引你找到回归的路。它就像内识，你看？</p>
<p>You have entered a world where God is unknown, where people are unknown to each other and even to themselves. But there is a deeper Intelligence within you that does know. It is like a little bit of Heaven came along for the ride into this descent into the world of form, change, life and death.</p>
<p>你已经进入一个上帝是未知的世界，在这里，人们互不相识，甚至连他们自己都不知道自己。但你内在深处的智能却知晓一切。它仿佛是天堂的点点滴滴，伴你坠入这充满形态、变化、生死的世界。</p>
<p>Even if you want nothing to do with God and Creation, purpose and destiny, well, too bad. God has come along for the ride, a little piece of God. You cannot shake if off. You cannot run away and hide. You can deny it. You can avoid it. You can build a firewall around it. But God comes along for the ride. You can say, “Oh, I don’t believe in any of this. I don’t believe in God. I don’t believe in this deeper Intelligence,” but the deeper Intelligence is still there.</p>
<p>即便你不想与上帝、创造、目的和天命有任何瓜葛，好吧，这太糟糕了。上帝已经随你而来，内识是上帝的一小部分。你无法摆脱它。你无法逃避躲藏。你可以否认它。你可以回避它。你可以在它周围筑起一道防火墙。但上帝已经随你而来。你可以说：“哦，我不相信这一切。我不相信上帝。我不相信这种更深层次的智能，”但更深层次的智能依然存在。</p>
<p>You may claim that you do not want to have a destiny, a purpose and a responsibility in being here. You want to be whatever you want to be. You want to be the god of your universe. You want to create your reality. It is okay. Go ahead. But God is still there. God is everywhere.</p>
<p>你或许会说，你不想拥有天命、目的和责任。你想成为任何你想成为的人。你想成为你宇宙的神。你想创造你的现实。没关系。去吧。但上帝依然存在。上帝无处不在。</p>
<p>You have forgotten your Heavenly state, your Ancient Home, but it is still there within you. And it is for this reason that redemption is there for you. It is for this reason that ultimately redemption is for everyone. It just is a matter of time and suffering. No matter what level of Hell and suffering someone may be in, whether they are in this world or in some other world, God will redeem them because God has come along for the ride.</p>
<p>你已经忘记了你的天堂状态，你的古老家园，但它依然存在于你的内在。正因如此，救赎才会降临到你身上。正因如此，最终救赎才会降临到每个人身上。这只是一个时间和苦难的问题。无论一个人身处何种程度的地狱和苦难，无论他们是在这个世界还是在另一个世界，上帝都会救赎他们，因为上帝已经陪伴他们同行。</p>
<p>If you can consider this, it will give you immense hope and confidence. But you must realize that it is you who must do the work. It is you who must build the bridge to Knowledge. It is you who must gain the courage and the determination to follow Knowledge. It is you who must develop the skills of discernment and discretion to build a connection to Knowledge, and to learn how to distinguish Knowledge from all the other voices in your mind—the voice of your culture, the voice of your parents, the voice of your family, the voice of your government, the voice of your beliefs, the voice of your ideology, the voice of your fantasies and the voice of those forces in your local environment that would dissuade you from discovering the power and presence of Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>如果你能思考这一点，它将赋予你极大的希望和信心。但你必须意识到，你必须去做这项工作。你必须构建通向内识的桥梁。你必须获得遵循内识的勇气和决心。你必须发展辨别力和审慎的技能，以构建与内识的一种联接，并学习如何区分内识与你心灵中的所有其他声音——你文化的声音，你父母的声音，你家庭的声音，你政府的声音，你信仰的声音，你意识形态的声音，你空想的声音，以及你当地环境中那些阻止你发现你自己内在内识力量和存在的力量的声音。</p>
<p>It is you who must learn how to govern your mind, to direct your thoughts, to still your mind when that is necessary. It is you who must learn how to communicate effectively with others and to look for the power and the presence of Knowledge within them. It is you who must advocate for the truth. It is you who must practice tolerance, restraint and forgiveness.</p>
<p>你必须学习如何统领你的心灵，引导你的思绪，并在必要时静止你的心灵。你必须学习如何与他人有效沟通，并寻找他们内在内识的力量和存在。你必须倡导真理。你必须修习宽容、克制和宽恕。</p>
<p>So do not think that you can sit back and think that God is going to take care of everything for you. For God has sent you here to take care of everything.</p>
<p>所以，不要认为你只要安心无忧，上帝就会为你安排好一切。因为上帝派你来到这里，就是为了照顾好一切。</p>
<p>Do not think that Knowledge is just going to show you what to do and tell you what to do, and you are going to be like a little child who is carried along. No, you are going to have to be the vehicle for Knowledge in the world and to gain the strength, the skill and the restraint and discernment necessary to assume this greater responsibility.</p>
<p>不要认为内识只是会指引你做什么、告诉你做什么，然后你就会像一个被人牵着走的小孩一样。不，你必须成为内识在世界上的载体，并获得承担这个更伟大责任所必需的实力、技能、克制和辨识力。</p>
<p>For while you may have your own personal goals and aspirations, your own obligations to others, your own limitations and so forth, Knowledge within you is here on a mission. It is your mission.</p>
<p>因为尽管你可能有你自己的个人目标和渴望，你自己对他人的义务，你自己的局限等等，但你内在的内识在此肩负着一个使命。它是你的使命。</p>
<p>You may invent any personal goal you like. You may try to be anything you want to be, which is usually just a process of mimicking others. You may set any kind of goal for yourself. You may rearrange your appearance. You may rearrange the outward appearance of your life. But it is all like redecorating your prison cell. Thinking you have transformed your life, you have only given it a different appearance, but your fundamental condition is still the same.</p>
<p>你可以设定任何你喜欢的个人目标。你可以尝试成为任何你想成为的人，但这通常只是一个模仿他人的过程。你可以为你自己设定任何目标。你可以重塑你的形象。你可以重新安排你生命的外在。但这一切都像重新装饰你的牢房。你认为你改变了生命，其实只是赋予了它不同的外观，而你的根本状态依然如故。</p>
<p>You can move to more pleasant surroundings. You can change your style. You can involve yourself in new things, exciting new things, and think you have really changed your life. But your condition, living in Separation, disconnected from the power and presence of Knowledge within yourself, has not changed. Your fundamental need, your fundamental relationship, has yet to be fully recognized.</p>
<p>你可以搬到更舒适的环境。你可以改变你的生活方式。你可以让你自己投入到新事物、令人兴奋的新事物中，并认为你真的改变了你的生命。但你生活在分离之中，与你内在内识的力量和存在脱节的状态并没有改变。你的根本需求，你的根本关系，尚未被充分认知。</p>
<p>That is why at some point, you have to come to the reality and the understanding that no amount of pleasure, escape, avoidance or stimulation is going to resolve your fundamental problem. You need Knowledge to guide you, to protect you and to reveal to you what is true, and to reveal to you the direction that your life is truly meant to go.</p>
<p>正因为如此，在某个时刻，你必须直面现实，并理解：无论多少快乐、逃避、回避或刺激，都无法解决你的根本问题。你需要内识来指引你，保护你，并向你揭示真理，向你揭示你生命真正注定要去的方向。</p>
<p>This requires, of course, humility. But it also requires real self-determination, for Knowledge is powerful and it has a real direction. If you do not have the necessary courage and determination, you will feel too weak and too ambivalent to follow this direction. You will be too insecure. You will feel you must live in a constant state of self-definition and personal control. But you cannot have this when following Knowledge, for it is mysterious, and you will not experience it every day.</p>
<p>这当然需要谦逊。但它也需要真正的自我决断，因为内识是强大的，它有一个真正的方向。如果你没有必要的勇气和决心，你将感到过于软弱和过于矛盾，无法遵循这个方向。你将过于不安全。你将感到你必须生活在一种持续的自我定义和个人控制的状态中。但当你遵循内识时，你无法拥有这些，因为它是神秘的，你不会每天体验它。</p>
<p>So can you abide with this uncertainty? Can you take these risks? Can you break the chains of your social conditioning and obligation to others to follow a greater power and presence within yourself? Can you put into question your fundamental ideas and beliefs and assumptions, waiting for Knowledge to reveal to you what is really true, and how to discern what is true from what is untrue, what is really good from what only looks good?</p>
<p>那么你能否坚守这种不确定性？你能否承担这些风险？你能否打破你社会条件和对他人的义务的枷锁，去追随你内在的一种更伟大力量和存在？你能否质疑你的根本想法、信仰和假设，等待内识向你揭示什么是真正的真理，以及如何辨别什么是真实的，什么是不真实的，什么是真正美好的，什么是仅仅看起来美好的？</p>
<p>No, there is no escape here. There is no welfare here. You cannot be like a little child here. You must become strong, determined, aware, humble and compassionate because this is what Knowledge will require from you if you are to learn of its reality and to follow its guidance.</p>
<p>不，这里没有逃离。这里没有福利。你不能像个小孩一样。你必须变得坚强、坚定、觉知、谦逊和富有同情心，因为如果你要学习内识的现实并遵循它的指引，这就是内识对你的要求。</p>
<p>What most people do not understand about Knowledge is that one of its primary goals is to keep you alive, for how can it prepare you for a greater life if you cannot stay alive? That is why Knowledge will protect you and exert its influence to restrain you from making mistakes, from committing yourself to relationships that have no future and destiny, from giving your life away to other people before you even know what your life is or what it is for.</p>
<p>大多数人不理解内识的一点是，它的主要目标之一是让你活着，因为如果你无法活着，它又如何能让你为一个更伟大的生命进行准备呢？正因为如此，内识会保护你，并发挥它的影响力，阻止你犯错，阻止你把你自己承诺给那些没有未来和天命的关系，阻止你甚至在知道你的生命是什么或它为何而存在之前就把你的生命交付给另一个人。</p>
<p>You feel these influences within yourself even if you choose to ignore them or to override them. You feel the exertions of Knowledge even if you think it is something else. How many times have you rushed to do something, feeling a sense of apprehension or real doubt or restraint within yourself? And yet you went ahead and did it anyway. That is part of everyone’s experience.</p>
<p>即使你选择忽略或超越这些影响，你依然会在你内在感受到它们。即使你认为它是别的东西，你依然会感受到内识的施展。有多少次，你匆忙地去做某件事，却感到内在的某种忧虑、真正的怀疑或克制？然而，你还是继续去做了。这是每个人都会经历的一部分。</p>
<p>At some point, you come to realize that you do not make good decisions, that you are blind to certain things, that you are easily persuaded by certain kinds of charms and inducements. You come to realize that you have these weaknesses, and they are really critical in affecting the quality and the outcome of your life. Here you come to see the need for Knowledge.</p>
<p>在某个时刻，你会意识到你无法做出正确的决定，你对某些事情视而不见，你很容易被某些魅力和诱惑所左右。你会意识到你拥有这些弱点，而它们对于影响你的生命质量和结果至关重要。在这里，你会看见对内识的需求。</p>
<p>You cannot give over all your authority to Knowledge because it is you who must do most of the work. But what you do have is a guide and a presence and a power of such immense strength and reliability—a power that cannot be corrupted by the world; a power that will not be seduced by the allurements of beauty, wealth and charm; a power that restores to you your essential worth and value and the meaning and direction of your life.</p>
<p>你无法把你所有的权威交给内识，因为你必须做大部分工作。但你确实拥有的是一个指引、一个存在和一个如此巨大强大和可靠的力量——一个不会被世界腐蚀的力量；一个不会被美丽、财富和魅力的诱惑所诱惑的力量；一个恢复你本质上的价值和重要性以及你生命意义和方向的力量。</p>
<p>What reward in the world could compare with this—beautiful possessions that you can stare at, acclaim by others who only want to use you for themselves, beauty to attract people with predatory interests, charm so you can control other people and get them to do what you want them to do, therefore forfeiting any hope of having a genuine and meaningful relationship with them?</p>
<p>世界上还有什么奖励能与此相比呢——你可以凝视的美丽物品，被那些只想利用你的人称赞，用美貌吸引那些有掠夺性兴趣的人，用魅力控制他人，让他们做你想让他们做的事情，从而放弃与他们建立真诚而有意义的关系的任何希望？</p>
<p>When you look at these inducements in the world, you will see that they are really a betrayal, for they require you to be something other than what you are. They deny you the value of genuine relationship and the experience of affinity with others.</p>
<p>当你审视世间的这些诱惑时，你会发现它们实际上是一种背叛，因为它们要求你成为某种不同于你本来面目的人。它们否定了你与他人真诚关系的价值以及亲密关系的体验。</p>
<p>Here you use people and everything as if they were merely resources to achieve your goals, but in doing so, you become only a resource. Honesty, inspiration, recognition, true relationship—they are all lost to you. You pay the biggest price of all. And in the end, there is dreadful disappointment, a fruitless life.</p>
<p>在这里，你利用他人和一切，仿佛它们只是实现目标的资源，但这样做，你也只是变成了一种资源。诚实、灵感、认可、真正的关系——你全都失去了。你付出了最大的代价。最终，你会感到无比的失望，过着毫无成果的生命。</p>
<p>Even if you achieve wealth and dominance, you are a person unknown to yourself. You are like a predator. You do not know your value. You do not know your purpose. You are alone. You are afraid. You are lost in your role that you have created for yourself. You are a prisoner in your beautiful little cell.</p>
<p>即使你拥有了财富和权力，你对你自己来说仍然是一个未知的人。你就像一个捕食者。你不知道你的价值。你不知道你的目的。你孤独。你感到恐惧。你迷失在你为你自己设定的角色中。你就像一个囚徒，囚禁在你美丽的小牢房之中。</p>
<p>Think for a moment if this is what you want to achieve for yourself. Go be with the wealthy and the powerful and see if they inspire you. They might intrigue you with their possessions and their pleasures. But look and see if they, as individuals, inspire you or if you would give your life to them.</p>
<p>想一想，这是否就是你自己想要实现的目标。去和那些有钱有势的人相处，看看他们是否能激励你。他们或许会用他们的财富和享乐来吸引你。但你也应该看看，他们作为个体，是否能激励你，或者你是否会将你自己的生命交给他们。</p>
<p>You may want wealth so you do not have to work so hard to improve your circumstances. And there is merit here to a certain degree. But if you lose yourself—if you lose your heart, if you lose your mind in the process, you will be the great loser.</p>
<p>你或许渴望财富，这样就不必费尽心机去改善你的境遇。这在某种程度上确实有其价值。但如果你迷失了你自己——如果你丢失了你的心，如果你在这个过程中迷失了心灵，你就会成为最大的失败者。</p>
<p>It is better that you fail at your pursuits and not forfeit your life in the process. That is why for some people failure is much better than success. It gives them a chance to rediscover their fundamental relationship with Knowledge, whereas the other person who achieves their goals becomes ever further away from Knowledge. They think they are winning when they are really losing. And they will keep trying to win in the same way, thus losing evermore. For the only real satisfaction to the deeper need of the soul is for you to find your purpose and to fulfill it.</p>
<p>最好是在你的追求中失败，而不是在此过程中失去你的生命。正因为如此，对一些人来说，失败远胜于成功。失败赋予他们一个机会，重新发现他们与内识的根本关系，而其他实现了他们目标的人却越来越远离内识。他们认为他们赢了，而实际上他们却输了。他们会继续以同样的方式试图赢，从而不断输。因为，对灵魂更深层次需求的唯一真正满足，就是你找到你的目的并去成就它。</p>
<p>You may surround yourself with beautiful things and beautiful people and beautiful places, but if you have not found your purpose and your true direction, then your soul is uneasy. And your mind will be filled with conflict and dissatisfaction. You have created a grand illusion for yourself, and you are trying to gain value from it, but it can only give you so very little.</p>
<p>你或许被美好的事物、美好的人和美好的地方包围着，但如果你还没有找到你的目的和真正的方向，你的灵魂就会感到不安。你的心灵也会充满冲突和不满。你为你自己创造了一个宏大的幻象，你试图从中获得价值，但它能给你的却寥寥无几。</p>
<p>For you to have a genuine relationship with another, the presence of Knowledge must be there because to join your soul with another requires the permission of your soul. It is not a function of the will of your mind: “I am going to make myself give myself to this person.” If Knowledge will not go there, then you do not have a real relationship with this other person. It is a relationship based upon attraction, based upon manipulation, based upon illusion and usury. It will not withstand the difficulties and the challenges of living a real life.</p>
<p>为了与另一个人拥有一种真正的关系，内识的存在必须存在，因为将你的灵魂与另一个人结合需要你灵魂的许可。它并非你心灵意志的运作：“我要把自己交给这个人。”如果内识不去那里，那么你就没有与这个人拥有一种真正的关系。它是一种基于吸引、基于操纵、基于幻象和高利贷的关系。它将经受不住过一种真实生命的艰难和挑战。</p>
<p>So the pretty faces fall away. And the wealth and splendor lead to a kind of self-degradation, a dissipation of your Spirit. This leads many people to addictions. They try to self-medicate themselves from feeling the pain and anguish of their empty lives.</p>
<p>于是，美丽的容颜渐渐消逝。财富与辉煌导致了一种自我堕落，一种精神的消散。这导致许多人染上了毒瘾。他们试图用药物来缓解他们空虚生命中的痛苦与煎熬。</p>
<p>But Knowledge is still with you. It is with you right now. If you still your mind and learn to do this, quiet yourself down, you can begin to feel that Knowledge has delivered messages to you already. Imagine that there is a mailbox in you and Knowledge delivers messages to you. And so you go every day to see if there is anything in your mailbox, anything you know you need to do that day or to finish from the days before. You follow Knowledge in little things, and then you gain the strength and the confidence to follow Knowledge in greater things.</p>
<p>但内识依然与你同在。它此刻就与你同在。如果你静止你的心灵，学会这样做，让你自己平静下来，你就能开始感受到内识已经将讯息传递给你。想象一下，你内在有一个邮箱，内识将讯息传递给你。于是你每天都会去看看邮箱里是否有东西，是否有任何你知道今天需要做的事情，或者前几天需要完成的事情。你在小事上遵循内识，然后你便获得力量和信心，并在更伟大的事情上遵循内识。</p>
<p>When you go to the restaurant and you choose from the menu, think about everything that attracts you. Is that really what you should eat tonight? It is a feeling. Maybe it does not matter, but in certain cases it will because you are asking. Before you go out to see a movie, ask yourself: “Should I really see this movie?” Whether Knowledge responds or not, the importance is you are asking. And you will begin to feel and hear a response.</p>
<p>当你去餐厅点菜时，想想所有吸引你的东西。这真的是你今晚应该吃的吗？它是一种感觉。也许这无关紧要，但在某些情况下，它很重要，因为你在提问。在你出去看电影之前，问问你自己：“我真的应该看这部电影吗？”无论内识是否回应，重要的是你在提问。然后你就会开始感受到并听到回应。</p>
<p>This will temper your desires. This will weaken the attraction of other things upon you. This will begin to mitigate your compulsions and your need to escape from yourself.</p>
<p>这会缓和你的欲望。这会削弱其他事物对你的吸引力。这会开始减轻你的冲动和逃避你自己的需求。</p>
<p>At first, it will create a struggle, a struggle between what you know and what you want. You want this thing, but Knowledge really does not care, which means it is not important. You want to have this thing, this person, this experience and you go to Knowledge. It is either restraining you, or it does not care. And you see the difference between what you want, between the needs and the driving desires of your intellect, and the real nature of the deeper Intelligence within you.</p>
<p>起初，它会制造一种斗争，一种你所知与你渴望之间的斗争。你想要这个东西，但内识真的不在乎，这意味着它并不重要。你想要拥有这个东西，这个人，这个体验，于是你走向内识。它要么限制你，要么漠不关心。你会看到你想要的东西之间的区别，你智力的需求和驱动欲望之间的区别，以及你内在更深层次智能的真正自然之间的区别。</p>
<p>You see that what you thought you wanted you really do not want. What you thought was so attractive really has no draw upon Knowledge within yourself. What you are really worried about, well, Knowledge is not worried about it. Whether you are up in the clouds in your imagination or whether you are down in the forest of Knowledge, it makes such a difference in what influences you, what affects you, what draws you and what is really important to you.</p>
<p>你会看到，你认为你想要的东西，其实你并不想要。你认为如此诱人的东西，其实对你内在的内识毫无吸引力。你真正担心的，嗯，内识并不担心。无论你是在想象的云端，还是在内识的森林深处，什么影响你，什么触动你，什么吸引你，什么对你真正重要，都有很大的区别。</p>
<p>Here you begin to see in your own experience that there is a part of you that is wise and abiding, and there is a part of you that is unwise, that is foolish, that is gullible, that is easily persuaded and seduced. There is a part of you that will fall into the traps that are set around you, and there is a part of you that will not. There is a part of you that will give your life away for some pretty face or charming personality. And there is a part of you that will never do this.</p>
<p>在这里，你开始在你自身的体验中看到，你的一部分是明智而坚守的，而你的一部分是不明智的、愚蠢的、易受骗的、容易被说服和诱惑的。你的一部分会落入你周围设置的陷阱，而你的一部分不会。你的一部分会为了某个漂亮的脸蛋或迷人的个性而放弃你的生命。而你的一部分永远不会这样做。</p>
<p>It is connecting to Knowledge, it is identifying with Knowledge, it is following Knowledge in its motivations, its restraints and its indifference that liberates your mind and centers your experience of yourself at a deeper level, at a deeper and more profound foundation.</p>
<p>它联接着内识，它认同着内识，它遵循着内识的动机、限制和冷漠，它解放了你的心灵，并将你对你自己的体验集中在一个更深层次的层面、一个更深刻、更深远的基础之上。</p>
<p>People may pray to God for deliverance, for freedom, to achieve their goals, to free them from danger. They may prostrate themselves. They may fervently carry on the ceremonies of their religion.</p>
<p>人们可以向上帝祈祷，祈求解脱、自由、实现目标、摆脱危险。他们可能会匍匐前进。他们可能会虔诚地履行宗教仪式。</p>
<p>But God has already put Knowledge within you. But it is not up at the surface where you live. It is deeper down. It is not an idea. It is not an intellectual exercise to go to Knowledge. It is not something your mind can construct and control. Your mind can only participate. It is not in charge of the process.</p>
<p>但上帝已经将内识置于你的内在。但它并非存在于你生命的表面。它存在于更深层次的底层。它并非一种想法。它并非一种通往内识的智力练习。它并非你的心灵能够建构和控制的东西。你的心灵只能参与。它并不掌管这个过程。</p>
<p>People keep trying to understand. They try to understand. They try to conceptualize, come to conclusions, give things form, give things limitation. But with the really important things in life, the intellect was not designed to do this. It was designed to problem solve the difficulties of life—to meet the challenge of survival, to meet the challenge of living and adapting to a world in a constant state of change and flux. But it was not created to discern and to define the greater meaning and purpose of life. These are profound experiences that are happening at a deeper level.</p>
<p>人们不断尝试理解。他们尝试去理解。他们尝试概念化，得出结论，赋予事物形式，赋予事物限制。但对于生命中真正重要的事情，智力并非被设计来做这些。它被设计来应对生命的困境——应对生存的挑战，应对生存和适应一个不断变化和流动的世界的挑战。但它并非被创造来辨识和定义生命的更伟大意义和目的。这些是发生在一个更深层次层面上的深刻体验。</p>
<p>If you want to know where the ocean currents are going, you have to go beneath the surface. You have to look at the bigger picture. If you want to know why the winds blow one way one day and another way another day, you have to understand the climate at a larger scale, the forces that are moving what you experience locally every day.</p>
<p>如果你想知道海洋的流向，你必须深入海面之下。你必须着眼于更广阔的视野。如果你想知道为什么风向一天一个方向，另一天又另一个方向，你必须从更广阔的尺度去理解气候，去理解那些推动着你每天所经历的局部变化的力量。</p>
<p>Within yourself, this is a mystery. The intellect has limits. It has boundaries. It may create fabulous cosmological systems of thought, but the Mystery is always beyond.</p>
<p>在你自己的内心，这是一个谜。智力是有极限的，是有边界的。它或许能创造出奇妙的宇宙观思想体系，但神秘永远超越它。</p>
<p>To experience this Mystery, you have to get out of your mind. You have to go beneath the surface and take the Steps to Knowledge. You have to set aside your notions of metaphysical reality and all the associations that your mind will try to make because, really, the core experience does not need these things. And it may not validate them at all. At the level of Knowledge, you may find out that life is very different from what you thought it was, or thought it should be.</p>
<p>要体验这个神秘，你必须跳出你的心灵。你必须深入表象之下，踏上通往内识的阶梯。你必须抛开你对形而上学现实的观念，以及你心灵试图构建的所有联想，因为核心体验实际上并不需要这些东西。它甚至可能根本不会去验证它们。在内识的层面上，你可能会发现，生命与你想象的，或者你认为它应该是什么样子，大相径庭。</p>
<p>The power and presence of Knowledge is within you. It represents your most fundamental relationship. It represents the source of your strength, your integrity and your safety. It will keep you from giving your life away. It will hold you back from self-destructive behavior. It will give you the power of discernment to know who to be with and how to be with them, and all the many things you must avoid, and how to regard a world in change and a world in conflict.</p>
<p>内识的力量和存在就在你的内在。它代表着你最根本的关系。它代表着你的力量、你的完整性和你安全的源泉。它将阻止你放弃你的生命。它将阻止你做出自我毁灭的行为。它将赋予你辨别力，让你知晓该和谁在一起以及如何与他们相处，以及你必须避免的所有许多事情，以及如何看待一个变化中的世界和一个冲突中的世界。</p>
<p>Knowledge is quiet and pervasive. It is not restless and agitated like your intellect. It will give you the power to see, to know and to act with a deeper certainty and a greater determination.</p>
<p>内识是安静的且无所不在。它不像你的智力那样躁动不安。它将赋予你力量，使你能够以更深刻的确定性和更强大的决心去看见、去知道、去行动。</p>
<p>This is what you need now. You who can hardly sit still for five minutes need this power of concentration. You need to know how to be at ease, to slow down, to be with things fully, to consider your decisions more deeply, to evaluate things with greater objectivity, to stop all this running around and this foolishness, to really be with the essential things of your life.</p>
<p>这就是你现在需要的。你连五分钟都坐不住，你需要这种专注的力量。你需要知道如何放松，放慢脚步，全身心地投入到事物中，更深入地思考你的决定，更客观地评估事物，停止所有的奔波和愚蠢，真正地投入到你生命中最重要的事情中。</p>
<p>Ask yourself: “What is it that is really important to me in life?” Keep asking this question and keep writing down whatever comes to mind. Do this for a time, and then look at your relationships with people and places and things and say: “Does this really represent what is really important to me? Can this really support what is really important to me?”</p>
<p>问问你自己：“在生命中，对我真正重要的是什么？”不断地问你自己这个问题，并写下所有浮现在心灵中的想法。坚持一段时间，然后审视你与人、地点和事物的关系，并问自己：“这真的代表了我真正重要的东西吗？这真的能支持我真正重要的东西吗？”</p>
<p>You will be shocked at what you see. You will see how little you have settled for, how much compromise you have made when compromise was not required. You will see that you are associating with people and places in a way that does not represent your deepest inclinations, your most profound needs.</p>
<p>你会对你所看到的感到震惊。你会看到你所接受的现实有多么低，看到你在没有必要妥协的时候做出了多少妥协。你会发现你与一些人和地方的关系并不代表你最深的倾向和最深刻的需求。</p>
<p>You will see that it is better to be alone than to be with people who cannot or will not recognize who you are and discern your greater purpose and direction, and that all this social behavior ends up meaning nothing unless you have a really deeper connection with people and are doing something important in life with them.</p>
<p>你会看到，独处比和那些不能或不愿认出你是谁、辨别你的更伟大目的和方向的人在一起要好，而且所有这些社交行为最终都毫无意义，除非你与人们有着一种真正更深层次的联接，并与他们一起做一些生命中重要的事情。</p>
<p>All this running away and obsession with things of little value is wasting your life; spending your intelligence, your time and your energy, and you are missing out on the really important things. You are not paying attention to your environment sufficiently. You are not seeing the Great Waves of change that are coming over the horizon. You are not taking your life seriously.</p>
<p>所有这些逃避和对无价值事物的执着，都在浪费你的生命；消耗你的智能、时间和能量，你正在错失真正重要的事情。你没有充分关注你的环境。你没有看到地平线上即将来临的变革巨浪。你没有认真对待你的生命。</p>
<p>What is really important to you that is more important than anything else? If you can only be, do or have three things in life, what would they be? Are you living a life based upon this? Are your standards high enough? Are you functioning and behaving according to your most fundamental needs? How can you be trivial and unaware of your behavior when you have such a great mission to do in your life, such a deeper conscience within yourself?</p>
<p>对你来说，什么才是真正重要、比其他任何事情都更重要的？如果你一生只能成为、做或拥有三件事，你会选择哪三件事？你的人生是否以此为基础？你的标准够高吗？你的行为举止是否符合你最根本的需求？当你肩负着如此伟大的使命，内心深处有着如此深刻的良知时，你怎么能如此漠不关心、浑然不觉呢？</p>
<p>Knowledge will begin to emerge within you when you really see that you need it, and you see how much you need it, and you see that without it, you will live a life far below what it is really meant to be. You will see the degree to which your thoughts, your feelings and your behavior are determined by the will and the expectation of others.</p>
<p>当你真正看到你需要内识，看到你多么需要它，看到没有它，你的生命将远低于它真正应有的状态时，内识将开始在你内在呈现。你将看到你的思想、你的感受和你的行为在多大程度上受到他人意志和期望的左右。</p>
<p>Knowledge will emerge when you see that it is essential and fundamental to your life. Then you will bring the necessary determination and recognition to bear. Perhaps disappointment will bring you to this recognition within yourself. Perhaps personal failure that you so earnestly seek to avoid will be the one thing that will sober your mind and show you your greater need, the deeper need of your soul, and return you to a more profound experience within yourself.</p>
<p>当你看到内识对你的生命至关重要且根本时，它便会浮现。那时，你将带着必要的决心和认知去承担。或许失望会带给你内在的这种认知。或许你如此热切地寻求避免的个人失败，将会是那件能够清醒你的心灵，向你展示你更伟大需求，你灵魂更深刻需求的事情，并让你回归你内在一种更深刻的体验。</p>
<p>Your intellect is a marvelous instrument when rightfully employed. It is creative. It is brilliant. It has immense capabilities when it is properly employed. But it must serve something greater. It makes a wonderful servant, but a very poor god.</p>
<p>只要运用得当，你的智力就是一件了不起的工具。它是创造性的。它才华横溢。只要运用得当，它的能力是无穷的。但它必须服务于更伟大的事情。它是一位出色的仆人，但却是一位非常糟糕的神。</p>
<p>It is weak. It is fallible. It is easily seduced and persuaded. It is judgmental. It is vengeful. It is jealous. It is petty. It is obsessive. It is all these things when it has nothing greater to serve that it is meant and designed to serve. Without this greater service, it is insecure. It does not know what it is doing. It is a great vehicle of communication with nothing really to serve of any value or meaning.</p>
<p>它是软弱的。它是易犯错误的。它容易被诱惑和说服。它评判性强。它报复心强。它嫉妒。它心胸狭隘。它偏执。当它没有更伟大的服务时，它注定并被设计去服务。没有这种更伟大的服务，它是不安全的。它不知道自己在做什么。它是一种伟大的沟通载体，却没有任何真正有价值或意义的服务。</p>
<p>Its potency is being wasted. Its capabilities are not being cultivated. And so it acts erratically and foolishly. Having no real security within itself, having no greater service to perform, it begins to function improperly.</p>
<p>它的潜能被浪费了。它的能力没有得到培养。因此，它的行为反复无常，愚蠢至极。由于它自身缺乏真正的安全感，也缺乏更伟大的服务可做，它开始运作失常。</p>
<p>That is why people who are so intelligent live such foolish and pointless lives, for they have not found their greater service. They are not bringing their intellect and their body into service to the real purpose that has brought them here. So nothing is working very well. And the body becomes the slave of the mind and is punished by the mind’s own conflicts and misappropriations.</p>
<p>正因如此，那些如此聪慧的人，却过着如此愚蠢、毫无意义的生命，因为他们尚未找到更伟大的服务。他们没有将他们的智力和身体服务于引领他们来到这个世界的真正目的。所以一切都进展不顺。身体成了心灵的奴隶，并因心灵自身的冲突和挪用而受到惩罚。</p>
<p>You see this everywhere. Do not condemn people for their errors or their foolishness, but instead learn from them. For life around you is teaching you the merits of following Knowledge and the results of not following Knowledge. Let everything teach you the value of gaining access to this deeper Intelligence.</p>
<p>你随处可见这一点。不要谴责人们的错误或愚蠢，而要向他们学习。因为你周围的生命正在教导你遵循内识的益处，以及不遵循内识的后果。让一切教导你通往这个更深层次智能的价值。</p>
<p>But remember, you cannot use Knowledge. It is not a resource for the intellect. You cannot use it to win contests, or to control others, or to manipulate the future, or to build personal wealth. Spirit is not a resource for the mind. Many people make this mistake, and it is a fundamental error.</p>
<p>但请记住，你无法使用内识。它并非智力的资源。你无法用它赢得竞争，无法控制他人，无法操纵未来，也无法积累个人财富。精神并非心灵的资源。许多人都犯了这个错误，这是一个根本性的错误。</p>
<p>This is the mind trying to be God, using God, or trying to use God. But it cannot be done. The mind cannot use Knowledge. Knowledge will just become silent, as if it does not even exist. You cannot use Knowledge to win the lottery, or to make someone love you, or to make some kind of scheme to become wealthy, to profit off the failure and errors of others. Knowledge is ethical and moral. It will not do this. So it will withdraw, and you will think it does not even exist.</p>
<p>这是心灵试图成为上帝，利用上帝，或试图利用上帝。但这做不到。心灵无法利用内识。内识只会变得沉默，仿佛它根本不存在。你无法利用内识来赢得彩票，或让某人爱上你，或制定某种计划来致富，从他人的失败和错误中获利。内识是伦理的、道德的。它不会这样做。所以它会撤退，而你会认为它根本不存在。</p>
<p>You come to Knowledge to give your life, to ask for help. You come in a state of humility and recognition of your true condition. You do not come to use or to manipulate. If that is your hidden intention, Knowledge will remain silent with you. It is far more intelligent than you are, your mind. It cannot be persuaded or manipulated or enrolled in your plans and schemes. If that is your design, Knowledge becomes quiet, and you do not even realize it is there. You will just weave your own illusions about it and think that you are being guided by Knowledge when you are really just being fooled by your own trap.</p>
<p>你来到内识面前，是为了给予你的生命，是为了寻求帮助。你带着谦逊和对自身真实境况的认知而来。你并非为了利用或操控而来。如果那是你隐藏的意图，内识将与你保持沉默。它远比你、你的心灵更加智能。它无法被说服、操控，也无法被纳入你的计划和图谋。如果那是你的计划，内识就会变得安静，而你甚至意识不到它的存在。你只会编织你自己的幻想，并认为你正受到内识的指引，而实际上你只是被你自己的陷阱所愚弄。</p>
<p>You take the Steps to Knowledge realizing that you are dealing with the Presence of God within yourself. You come based upon your real needs in a state of humility and honest recognition. You do not come as a swindler or a predator. You come because that is where nature and your deepest impulses are bringing you. You come because you see you cannot manage or direct your life effectively without this greater power and Intelligence. You come to see that you cannot define your life or live according to society’s models alone if you are to have any real meaning to your existence.</p>
<p>你踏上内识进阶，意识到你正在应对你自己内在的上帝存在。你基于你真正的需求，带着谦逊和诚实的认知而来。你并非以骗子或掠食者的姿态而来。你来这里，是因为自然和你最深层次的冲动将你带到这里。你来这里，是因为你明白，如果没有这更伟大的力量和智能，你就无法有效地管理或指引你的人生。你明白，如果你想让你的存在有任何真正的意义，你就无法仅仅按照社会的模式来定义你的生命或生活。</p>
<p>You come to Knowledge because it is entirely natural for you to do so. Realizing your limits, realizing your capacity for error, realizing the vulnerability of your life and the fragility of your circumstances, you come to Knowledge. You do not know what Knowledge will give you. You just come to Knowledge.</p>
<p>你走向内识，因为这对你来说完全是自然而然的。意识到你的局限，意识到你犯错的能力，意识到你生命的脆弱以及你境遇的脆弱，你走向内识。你不知道内识会给你什么。你只是走向内识。</p>
<p>This is the great turning point in life. And many people come here as a result of profound disappointment and disillusionment. They come because they feel the deeper need of the soul. And they realize they cannot fulfill this need by all the things they have been trying to do, to be and to have. This is a great moment. This is promising. They are cheering in the stands in Heaven because you are coming to Knowledge.</p>
<p>这是生命中伟大的转折点。很多人是因为深刻的失望和幻灭而来到这里。他们来这里是因为他们感受到灵魂更深层次的需求。他们意识到，他们无法通过他们一直试图去做、去成为、去拥有的一切来满足这个需求。这是一个伟大的时刻。这是充满希望的。他们在天堂的看台上欢呼，因为你正在走向内识。</p>
<p>God has provided the Steps to Knowledge in God’s New Revelation for the world. The pathway to Knowledge has been established within all the great traditions, but you must search for them. And you must find the real teachers, who can be difficult to find. They are not the public figures. They are not the personalities in the media. They are not the celebrities of religion. They are the hidden, secret teachers. They may be very difficult to find. So God has sent the Steps to Knowledge in a form that anyone can use right where they are without having to search the deep recesses of the world.</p>
<p>上帝在上帝新启示中为世界提供了内识进阶。内识之路已在所有伟大传统中建立，但你必须去探索它们。你必须找到真正的导师，他们可能很难找到。他们不是公众人物。他们不是媒体上的名人。他们不是宗教名人。他们是隐秘的、秘密的老师。他们可能非常难以找到。因此，上帝以一种任何人都可以在他们所在的地方使用的形式发送了内识进阶，而无需探寻世界的深处。</p>
<p>God has sent a Message in a pure form. It has not been taken over by governments. It has not been changed by ambitious individuals. It has not been codified and altered by people who have no real spiritual foundation. It comes in a pure form. It appears humble and simple, but it is deep and pervasive.</p>
<p>上帝以一种纯粹的形式发送了一条讯息。它没有被政府接管。它没有被野心勃勃的个人篡改。它没有被没有真正精神基础的人编纂和篡改。它以一种纯粹的形式到来。它看似谦逊而简单，但它深刻而无所不在。</p>
<p>People may look at it and say, “Oh, I know all about this. I understand this.” But they do not understand it. They think it fits in with their set of ideas. They have no idea what they are dealing with here.</p>
<p>人们可能会看着它说：“哦，我全知道了。我明白了。” 但他们并不理解。他们认为这符合他们的观念。他们根本不知道他们在这里处理什么。</p>
<p>God has sent the Steps to Knowledge because everyone needs Knowledge now. It is not merely a reward for the elite, for the select or for the few. Everyone needs the power and presence of Knowledge now.</p>
<p>上帝赐予内识进阶，因为每个人现在都需要内识。它不仅仅是对精英、被选中的人或少数人的奖赏。每个人现在都需要内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>They need this for the need of their soul. They need this to bring harmony and clarity to their circumstances. They need this to correct mistakes and to find their true direction. They need this to prepare for the Great Waves of change that are coming over the horizon, which will alter the landscape of the world. They need this so they may have a chance to find and to fulfill their greater purpose for coming into the world. They need this for safety and protection, not only from physical harm and deprivation, but from control and manipulation by others who are seeking to use them as a resource.</p>
<p>他们需要这个，为了他们灵魂的需求。他们需要这个，为他们的境遇带来和谐与清晰。他们需要这个，为纠正错误，找到他们真正的方向。他们需要这个，为即将到来、将改变世界图景的变革巨浪进行准备。他们需要这个，这样他们才有机会发现并实现他们来到这个世界的更伟大目的。他们需要这个，为了安全和保护，不仅为了免遭物质伤害和剥夺，也为了免遭那些试图利用他们作为资源的人的控制和操控。</p>
<p>Everyone needs Knowledge now—the rich, the poor, the advantaged, the disadvantaged in every nation and culture and tribe, in every village and town because God redeems you through Knowledge, through your adherence to Knowledge, through your uniting with Knowledge. That is how God redeems the separated everywhere, always, in every world, on every planet, in every galaxy. That is the Plan of God.</p>
<p>现在每个人都需要内识——无论富人、穷人、优势者还是弱势者，在每个国家、文化和部落，在每个村庄和城镇，因为上帝通过内识，通过你对内识的坚守，通过你与内识的结合来救赎你。这就是上帝在每个地方、每个世界、每个星球、每个星系救赎分离者的方式。这就是上帝的计划。</p>
<p>In every religion, in every faith tradition, this is how God redeems the separated: by reuniting you with the power and presence of Knowledge and by enabling you to fulfill your mission in life. This is what reunites you with your Source, with your power, with your worth. And this is done in such a way that the world that you live in benefits from your redemption. It is just not a selfish pursuit for enlightenment. You contribute to the world immensely. And you are redeemed in the process because your contribution is coming from Knowledge. This is the gift and the power, the promise and the reality.</p>
<p>在每一种宗教中，在每一种信仰传统中，上帝都是这样救赎分离者的：通过让你与内识的力量和存在重新联合，并通过让你能够完成你生命中的使命。这让你与你的本源、你的力量、你的价值重新联合。而这以这样一种方式完成，使得你所生活的世界受益于你的救赎。它不仅仅是一种对开悟的自私追求。你对世界做出了极大的贡献。你在这个过程中得到了救赎，因为你的贡献来自内识。这是礼物和力量，是承诺和现实。</p>
<p>Let this be your understanding.</p>
<p>让这成为你的理解。</p>
