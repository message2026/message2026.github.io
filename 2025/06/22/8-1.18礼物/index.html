<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on March 31, 2007 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2007 年 3 月 31 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The New Message from God gives the individual tremendous power. It redirects your focus to the great endowment of Knowledge that the Creator of all life has placed within each person. If this Knowledge can be discovered, experienced, accepted and followed, then the individual will be able to establish a whole new foundation for living in the world. But this brings up the question of how much a person is responsible for their own experience, particularly before Knowledge can arise within them.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息赋予个体极大的力量。它将你的焦点重新导向所有生命的创造者赋予每个人内在的伟大内识。如果这个内识能够被发现、体验、接受和遵循，那么个人就能为在这个世界上生活奠定一种全新的基础。但这引出了一个问题：一个人对他们自身的体验负有多大的责任，尤其是在内识能够在他们内在升起之前。</p>
<p>Today, as in times past, there is a great deal of discussion about the creative potential of the mind—how much you can affect your own experience by changing or redirecting your thinking, by affirming that which you desire and by overlooking or setting aside that which you do not desire.</p>
<p>今天，如同过去一样，人们对心灵的创造潜力进行了大量讨论——通过改变或重新引导你的思维，通过肯定你所渴望的，通过忽略或抛弃你所不渴望的，你可以在多大程度上影响你自己的经历。</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, the great endowment, to guide you, the mind will attempt to create its own reality, and you have only to look at the condition of the world to see the effects of this. People striving to get what they want, people striving to protect what they have, people striving to protect their privileges in life or to gain these privileges or to take them away from others, even people’s desire for justice—all these things have created immense suffering and calamity, not only for the individuals involved, but for the entire world.</p>
<p>如果没有内识——那伟大的禀赋——来指引你，心灵就会试图创造它自己的现实，你只需看看世界的状况就能看到其后果。人们努力获取他们想要的东西，人们努力保护他们所拥有的东西，人们努力保护他们生命中的特权，或获得这些特权，或从他人手中夺走它们，甚至人们对正义的渴望——所有这些事情都制造了巨大的痛苦和灾难，不仅对相关个人，而且对整个世界都是如此。</p>
<p>Everything that happens in the world happens because someone wants it or needs it or desires it, and a good outcome is usually emphasized when the initial plans were laid. If you try to improve the quality of life without the great endowment, without the power and presence of Knowledge within you, you will only add to the conflict of the world. You will only add to the great decline in the world’s resources. You will act unitarily. You will deny the realities of the world to have what you want, to have your preferred outcome, to have your preferred life and to protect what you think you have already.</p>
<p>世界上发生的每件事，都是因为有人想要它、需要它或渴望它，而好的结果通常在最初的计划制定时就被强调。如果你试图改善生命品质，却没有伟大的禀赋，没有你内在内识的力量和存在，你只会加剧世界的冲突。你只会加剧世界资源的大幅衰退。你将行动单一。你将否认世界的现实，去拥有你想要的，去拥有你偏好的结果，去拥有你偏好的生命，去守护你认为你已经拥有的。</p>
<p>The great tragedy here is that you will attempt to do this in the face of the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world—the decline in humanity’s vital resources, the decline in the environment, the impact upon climate and weather and the great risk of conflict and war between groups and nations over the remaining resources.</p>
<p>这里最大的悲剧在于，你们试图这样做的时候，世界正面临着变革巨浪——人类重要资源的减少、环境的恶化、对气候和天气的影响，以及不同群体和国家之间为争夺剩余资源而发生冲突和战争的巨大风险。</p>
<p>In the face of all this, the individual who is trying to acquire what they want above all else can only be part of the problem and not part of the solution. And even if you want to be part of the solution, how can you do this without the great endowment to guide you? How can you be assured that your actions are truly beneficial and will not simply deprive others in the world in order for you to acquire what you desire?</p>
<p>面对这一切，那些一心想得到他们最想要东西的人，只能成为问题的一部分，而不是解决方案的一部分。即便你想成为解决方案的一部分，如果没有伟大的禀赋指引，你又如何能做到呢？你又如何能确信你的行为真正有益，不会为了得到你所渴望的东西而简单地剥夺世上其他人的利益呢？</p>
<p>You cannot assure this. If you look at humanity’s predicament with compassion and with wisdom, you will see that the conflict that is raging around the world and the greater conflicts that can emerge in the future will all be the result of people trying to create a better reality. They will make this attempt based upon their ideas, based upon their cultural values, based upon their national interests and based upon their own personal desires, not only for wealth, but for safety and security as well. It is not wrong to want these things, but it is destructive to attempt to gain them without the great endowment.</p>
<p>你无法保证这一点。如果你带着同情心和智慧审视人类的困境，你会看到，世界各地正在肆虐的冲突，以及未来可能出现的更大冲突，都将是人们试图创造一个更美好现实的结果。他们将基于他们的想法，基于他们的文化价值观，基于他们的国家利益，基于他们自身的个人欲望，做出这个尝试，不仅是为了财富，也是为了安全和保障。想要这些东西并没有错，但如果试图在没有伟大禀赋的情况下获得它们，则是毁灭性的。</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why the New Message from God is so essential in the world today because if humanity continues using the motivations that have gained it this position, these advantages and these calamities, the future of humanity will be more predictable and extremely grave.</p>
<p>这就是为什么来自上帝的新讯息在当今世界如此重要的原因之一，因为如果人类继续利用为其赢得这个地位、这些优势和这些灾难的动机，那么人类的未来将更加可预测且极其严峻。</p>
<p>To believe that you know what is good for the world, what is good for others and even what is good for yourself, that is taking a great risk. Every calamity began as someone’s good idea for themselves. Every social system that is proposed that has led to revolution, conflict, war and deprivation began in essence as a desire to improve humanity’s condition and to address and redress injustices and inequities.</p>
<p>相信你知道什么对世界有益，什么对他人有益，甚至什么对你自己有益，这本身就是在冒巨大的风险。每一场灾难的开始，都是某人为他们自己想出的好主意。每一种导致革命、冲突、战争和贫困的社会制度，其本质都源于改善人类状况、解决和纠正不公正与不平等的愿望。</p>
<p>Can you assume that you can know what is really good for the world? Today many people want both change and peace, and they do not see the contradiction in this. For change is not peaceful. It is difficult, challenging and upsetting if it is real change.</p>
<p>你能自以为知道什么对世界真正有益吗？如今，许多人既渴望变革，又渴望和平，但他们看不到这其中的矛盾。因为变革并不和平。真正的变革充满挑战，充满艰辛，令人不安。</p>
<p>Yet people want change and peace. They expect others who do not have what they have to be peaceful—to be peaceful and cooperative with one another. They think that someone else should take care of the great problems of the world, and they blame others for the fact that the world is the way it is today. They do not see their own part of the responsibility in this. They do not see their own culpability in this. They do not see that by attempting to create a better reality for themselves, unaware to them, they are only adding to the problem.</p>
<p>然而人们渴望改变与和平。他们期望那些没有他们所拥有的东西的人能够和平——彼此和平合作。他们认为其他人应该去处理世界上的重大问题，并将世界现状归咎于他人。他们看不到他们自己在其中应承担的责任。他们看不到他们自己在其中的罪责。他们看不到，通过试图为他们自己创造一个更好的现实，他们没有察觉到，他们只会加剧问题。</p>
<p>The Creator of all life knows that humanity must unite and cooperate for the preservation of the world, to prevent ever increasing war, degradation and decline in the future. There will be more people wanting fewer resources. So you see, if everyone is committed to getting what they want, here you see the essence of what creates war, competition, conflict and all of the tragedies that follow.</p>
<p>所有生命的创造者知道，人类必须团结合作，共同维护世界，防止未来战争加剧、环境恶化和衰败。未来人口将越来越多，而资源却越来越少。所以，你看，如果每个人都一心想得到自己想要的东西，你就会明白战争、竞争、冲突以及随之而来的所有悲剧的本质。</p>
<p>But the Creator of all life also knows that humanity needs to improve its condition, and that is why the great endowment has been placed within each person. For only Knowledge within you knows what will really work for you and how your efforts and your actions can lead to a beneficial outcome in the world.</p>
<p>但所有生命的创造者也知道人类需要改善其状况，正因如此，伟大的禀赋被赋予每个人的内在。因为只有你内在的内识知道什么对你真正有用，以及你的努力和你的行动如何才能在世界上带来有益的结果。</p>
<p>Consider this: Any social agenda that you propose, any political agenda that you espouse and that you further will be opposed by a large percentage of the population. Even if you think you have the perfect solution, the great idea, the best arrangement, what are you going to do with all those people who oppose you?</p>
<p>深思这个：你提出的任何社会议程，你拥护的任何政治议程，以及你进一步提出的任何议程，都会遭到很大一部分民众的反对。即使你认为你有完美的解决方案、绝妙的想法、最佳的安排，你又该如何应对所有反对你的人呢？</p>
<p>Perhaps they do not see the value of your ideas. Perhaps your ideas will strip them of their privileges. Perhaps they themselves have an entirely different proposal to make that they are furthering and that they are committed to. What are you going to do with these people? Override them? Subjugate them? Destroy them?</p>
<p>也许他们看不到你的想法的价值。也许你的想法会剥夺他们的特权。也许他们自己有完全不同的方案，他们正在推进并致力于此。你打算怎么处置这些人？压制他们？征服他们？还是摧毁他们？</p>
<p>This is the inherent danger in people inventing schemes without the power and presence of Knowledge. This is the mind trying to control life. This is the mind playing God in the world. You have only to look at the results to see that in the end a few people are richly supplied, and everyone else is left in deprivation. And overall, the world is being deprived. It is being degraded. For you are now living in a world of decline.</p>
<p>这是人们在缺乏内识力量和存在的情况下发明计划的内在危险。这是心灵试图控制生命。这是心灵在世界上扮演上帝。你只需看看结果就能发现，最终少数人得到了丰裕的供给，而其他人则陷入匮乏。总体而言，世界正在被剥夺。它正在被贬低。因为你现在正生活在一个衰落的世界里。</p>
<p>The truth is that the mind is creative. It creates fantasies. It creates nightmares. It creates scenarios. It creates explanations for the past. It creates new ideas for the future. Your mind was created to be creative. It is creative.</p>
<p>真理是，心灵是富有创造力的。它创造幻想，它制造噩梦，它创造各种场景，它为过去做出解释，它为未来创造新的想法。你的心灵生来就是为了创造。它确实富有创造力。</p>
<p>But this creative power of the mind is meant to serve something greater than itself. Without its position as being in service to a greater power, well, the mind is self-fulfilling. It is self-serving. It is consuming. And it will struggle and it will fight, it will blame and it will condemn when it is deprived of its goals.</p>
<p>但心灵的这种创造力，其本意是服务于一种比它自身更伟大的事物。如果心灵没有处于服务更伟大力量的位置，那么它就只能自我实现。它是自我服务的。它吞噬一切。当它的目标被剥夺时，它就会挣扎、抗争、责怪、谴责。</p>
<p>Your body is a beautiful instrument. It is marvelous in what it can do. But its real value is determined by what it serves. If it serves a conflicted agenda of the mind, then the body will do destructive things to itself and to other bodies and to the world around you.</p>
<p>你的身体是一台精美的仪器，它所能做到的令人惊叹。但它的真正价值取决于它所服务的对象。如果它服务于心灵的冲突议程，那么你的身体就会对它自己、他人的身体以及你周围的世界做出破坏性的事情。</p>
<p>Likewise, your mind is a fabulous instrument of communication. It is creative. It can comprehend the past. It can plan for the future. Indeed, the mind is a great membrane between your worldly existence and your spiritual reality. It is perceptive and creative, even to its own detriment, even to its own disadvantage.</p>
<p>同样，你的心灵是一个绝佳的沟通工具。它富有创造力。它能够理解过去。它能够规划未来。事实上，心灵是一道伟大的屏障，隔开你的世俗存在与你的精神现实。它富有洞察力和创造力，甚至对它自身有害，甚至对它自身不利。</p>
<p>So certainly re-orienting the mind to create things of value and meaning is very important, and many people are becoming aware of this. They realize that they determine their experience to a great degree by how they evaluate what they see around them, how they associate themselves and disassociate themselves. They see the power and the potential of the mind in this regard.</p>
<p>因此，重新引导心灵去创造有价值和意义的事情无疑非常重要，许多人也开始察觉到这一点。他们意识到，他们如何评价周围的事物，如何与他们联系和分离，在很大程度上决定了他们的体验。他们看到了心灵在这方面的力量和潜力。</p>
<p>However, what many people do not see is that the mind is meant to serve the greater power of Knowledge within the individual. If you are unaware of the great endowment, this great power, the mind will be reckless. It will be self-serving. It will be judgmental. It will be a harsh and oppressive ruler in your life and potentially in the lives of others.</p>
<p>然而，很多人没有看见，心灵的本意是服务于个体内在内识的更伟大力量。如果你没有察觉这个伟大的禀赋，这个伟大的力量，心灵就会变得鲁莽。它会自我服务。它会评判。它会成为你生命中，甚至潜在地，他人生命中，一个严酷而压迫的统治者。</p>
<p>Here the creative power of the mind and its greater potential in the future become undermined because it does not really serve the greater power within you. For in the true hierarchy of your mind, there is the body serving the mind, the mind serving the Spirit and the Spirit serving the Creator.</p>
<p>在这里，心灵的创造力及其未来的更伟大潜能受到损害，因为它并没有真正服务于你内在的更伟大力量。因为在你心灵的真正层级结构中，身体服务于心灵，心灵服务于精神，精神服务于造物主。</p>
<p>But if this true hierarchy is not established within your life and experience, then you will try to think and believe that you know what is best for you and for others, and you will attempt to assert this into the world. And here again, you see the seeds of conflict. You see the self-serving nature of this approach. It is fundamentally in error, not because the mind is not creative—the mind is creative. It is in error because the true hierarchy of your Being has not been recognized and established.</p>
<p>但如果这个真正的等级制度没有在你的生命和经历中建立起来，那么你就会试图去想并相信你知道什么对你和他人来说是最好的，并且你会试图把它强加到世界上。而在这里，你再次看到了冲突的种子。你看到了这种方法的自我服务的本质。它从根本上就是错误的，并非因为心灵不具有创造性——心灵是有创造性的。它之所以是错误的，是因为你存在真正的等级制度尚未被认知和建立。</p>
<p>If the mind serves itself, it will be fundamentally competitive and destructive. It will always want more of what it thinks it wants and needs. Beyond meeting certain basic survival requirements, it will always want more. It will never have enough. It will want more of this and more of that—more pleasure, more security, more recognition, more approval, more power, more dominance, more beauty.</p>
<p>如果心灵只服务于它自身，它从根本上就会充满竞争和破坏性。心灵会永远渴求更多它认为它想要和需要的事物。除了满足某些基本的生存需求之外，它总是想要更多。它永远都不够。它会想要更多这个，更多那个——更多的快乐，更多的安全感，更多的认可，更多的赞许，更多的权力，更多的支配，更多的美。</p>
<p>All these things become addictions of the mind. They cannot be satiated. You want more. You gain more. You are not satisfied. Of course, most people do not even have enough to really live a balanced and harmonious life. So the more you want for yourself, the more you draw from the limited resources of the world and the more you deprive other people.</p>
<p>所有这些事情都会变成心灵的瘾，永无止境。你想要更多，你得到更多，你并不满足。当然，大多数人甚至没有足够的东西来真正过上平衡与和谐的生命。因此，你对你自己的要求越多，你从这个世界有限的资源中汲取的就越多，你对其他人的剥夺也就越多。</p>
<p>You cannot escape this predicament. You cannot come up with a new idea, a new scheme or a new plan to resolve this fundamental problem. That is why God has placed Knowledge within you, for only Knowledge knows how to resolve this.</p>
<p>你无法逃离这个困境。你无法想出一个新想法、一个新方案或一个新计划来解决这个根本问题。正因如此，上帝将内识置于你的内在，因为唯有内识知道如何解决这个问题。</p>
<p>Only Knowledge knows how to provide advancement, security and fulfillment for you. And only Knowledge knows how to do this in such a way that it does not deprive others or the world, and that your pursuit of safety, security and fulfillment becomes beneficial for others because it is guided by Knowledge.</p>
<p>唯有内识知道如何为你提供进步、保障和成就。唯有内识知道如何以这样一种方式做到这一点：它不会剥夺他人或世界，并且你对安全、保障和成就的追求会因受到内识的指引而惠及他人。</p>
<p>Your intellect, as creative as it is, cannot figure this out. It does not have this depth of wisdom. It is not connected to life sufficiently. It does not have the clarity and the comprehension to do this.</p>
<p>你的智力，尽管富有创造力，却无法理解这一点。它缺乏这种深度的智慧。它与生命的联系不够充分。它缺乏做到这一点所需的清晰度和理解力。</p>
<p>That is because the mind is a vehicle of expression. Its source is the great endowment, and the source of the great endowment is the Creator of all life. Whether you are a religious person or not, whether you practice within a faith tradition or not, this is the fundamental reality of your life.</p>
<p>这是因为心灵是表达的载体。它的源泉是伟大的禀赋，而伟大禀赋的源泉是所有生命的创造者。无论你是否是宗教人士，无论你是否遵循某种信仰传统，这都是你生命的根本现实。</p>
<p>If you are unaware of Knowledge, you will be constantly striving to get what you want and avoid what you do not want, and you will be in constant judgment, frustration and indignation over the behavior and the thoughts of others and the condition of the world. The end result is you will be nothing more than a consumer, and you will be adding nothing more to the world than more judgment and condemnation—adding to the fuel of conflict that is already raging here.</p>
<p>如果你没有察觉内识，你将不断努力获得你想要的，逃避你不想要的，你将不断对他人的行为和思想以及世界的状况感到评判、沮丧和愤慨。最终的结果是你只不过是一个消费者，你给这个世界带来的只是更多的评判和谴责——给这里已经肆虐的冲突之火上浇油。</p>
<p>There are some people who believe that everything that happens to them is the result of their own creativity, however misguided. But what they fail to see is that everyone else is creating their reality too, and that the impact in the mental environment—the environment of thought and influence—is so much immensely greater by what everyone else is creating than what you individually can create that to think that you can produce all these results for yourself simply by directing the will and the power of the mind is to ignore the will and the power of all other minds.</p>
<p>有些人相信，发生在他们身上的一切都是他们自身创造力的产物，尽管这显然是错误的。但他们没有看见，其他人也在创造着他们的现实，而其他人的创造对心理环境——思想和影响力的环境——的影响远比你个人所能创造的要大得多。因此，如果你认为仅仅通过引导意志和心灵的力量就能为你自己创造所有这些结果，那就是无视所有其他心灵的意志和力量。</p>
<p>This assumption, then, certainly reinforces and is based on the belief in Separation. It does not take into account the effect that minds have upon one another. It does not recognize the impact and the influence of the mental environment. Though it may proclaim that everyone has the potential to recreate their experience, it does not take into account the fact that the mental environment is completely dominating for most people—to the point where very few people even have original thoughts. They are simply recycling all the influence that they are absorbing and have been absorbing since the day they were born.</p>
<p>那么，这种假设无疑强化了分离的信念，并且正是基于此。它没有考虑到心灵彼此之间的影响。它没有认识到心理环境的冲击和影响。尽管它或许宣称每个人都有重塑他们体验的潜力，但它却没有考虑到这样一个事实：心理环境对大多数人而言占据着绝对的主导地位——甚至很少有人拥有原创的思想。他们只是在循环利用他们正在吸收的、以及自出生以来就一直在吸收的所有影响。</p>
<p>And because human beings are essentially social creatures, they will always tend to associate with whatever group they identify with, whatever group they think is giving them promise and purpose, meaning and security.</p>
<p>由于人类本质上是社会性动物，他们总是倾向于与他们认同的群体联系，与他们认为能给他们带来承诺和目的、意义和安全感的群体联系。</p>
<p>The freedom of the mind, then, is really not possible within the mental environment. It is but a little light surrounded by millions of other lights. The only way out of this predicament is for the mind to follow Knowledge because Knowledge is not influenced by the mental environment. It is the only part of you that is beyond influence or manipulation from any source.</p>
<p>因此，在心理环境中，心灵的自由实际上是不可能的。它不过是被数百万盏其他光芒包围的一道小光。摆脱这个困境的唯一途径是让心灵追随内识，因为内识不受心理环境的影响。它是你唯一不受任何来源影响或操控的部分。</p>
<p>That is why it is your foundation for freedom. It is indeed Knowledge that will create a new life for you, create a new reality and a new experience for you. Only it has the power to do this because it is unaffected by the mental environment in which you live.</p>
<p>正因如此，它才是你自由的基础。正是内识，将为你创造一个新的生命，为你创造一个新的现实和新的体验。唯有它拥有力量做到这一点，因为它不受你所处心理环境的影响。</p>
<p>To think that you could create your reality without this is to invest yourself in an immense fantasy, an immense self-deception. It is based on ignorance and arrogance.</p>
<p>认为无需内识就能创造现实，无异于将你自己投入巨大的幻想，自欺欺人。它建立在无知和傲慢之上。</p>
<p>You do not realize the impact of all the social and religious conditioning around you and what you have done and will do to accommodate whatever group or network of people that you associate with. You will realize how shallow your understanding of things really is, what an oversimplification your basic ideas really are. And in a moment of real sobriety and self-honesty, you will realize how little you really understand of anything.</p>
<p>你没有意识到你周围所有社会和宗教熏陶的影响，以及你为了迎合你所交往的任何群体或网络而做过和将要做的一切。你会意识到你对事物的理解实际上有多么肤浅，你的基本观念实际上有多么过于简化。在真正清醒和自我诚实的时刻，你会意识到你对任何事物的理解有多么匮乏。</p>
<p>This moment of sobriety, though perhaps painful, is a moment of humility. And with that humility, you can gain a new understanding, a new recognition, of where your true power resides. Because personal power has very little power, it is a blind and presumptuous assertion, an assertion without a true foundation and without a true direction.</p>
<p>这一刻的清醒，或许会令人痛苦，但却是谦逊的时刻。凭借这份谦逊，你能够获得新的理解，新的认知，知道你真正的力量所在。因为个人力量的力量微乎其微，它是一种盲目而妄自尊大的断言，一种没有真正基础、没有真正方向的断言。</p>
<p>For the true foundation and the true direction can only be provided by Knowledge. And Knowledge is not something you can control. You cannot make Knowledge want what you think you want. You cannot make Knowledge give you what you think you must have.</p>
<p>因为真正的基础和真正的方向唯有内识才能提供。而内识并非你能掌控之物。你无法让内识想要你认为你想要的东西。你无法让内识给予你你认为你必须拥有的东西。</p>
<p>Knowledge is more powerful than the mind. It knows why it is here. It is here on a mission because you are here on a mission. Unaware of this mission, you will keep trying to satisfy the deeper needs of your soul by acquiring people, possessions and experiences. You will be in constant fear that you could lose all of these things, which are threatened by so many different things.</p>
<p>内识比心灵更强大。内识知道它为何在此。它在此肩负着使命，因为你在这里肩负着使命。若不察觉这个使命，你将不断试图通过获取人、财产和经验来满足你灵魂更深层次的需求。你将持续恐惧你可能会失去的所有这些东西，而这些东西正受到如此多不同事物的威胁。</p>
<p>It is a hopeless attempt at fulfillment. It is the attempt to make Separation work. It is the attempt to be God in your own universe and to fulfill yourself as God in your own universe, but it is essentially hopeless.</p>
<p>它是一次毫无希望的成就尝试。它是一次让分离奏效的尝试。它是一次在你自己的宇宙中成为上帝，并在你自己的宇宙中作为上帝实现你自己的尝试，但它本质上是毫无希望的。</p>
<p>Having a new idea or a new possibility, what is this going to do but simply cast you on another hopeless journey and use up more of your precious time in the world chasing another idea? The mind is desperate, but in the end, eventually, you must yield to the recognition that you yourself do not create reality. You only interpret reality. And the creative power of the mind is meant to serve a Greater Reality that exists both within you, within the great endowment of Knowledge, and beyond you, in Knowledge in the whole universe.</p>
<p>有了一个新的想法或一个新的可能性，它除了把你抛上另一段绝望的旅程，耗费你在这个世界上更多宝贵的时间去追逐另一个想法之外，还能做什么呢？心灵是绝望的，但在最后，最终，你必须屈服于这样的认知：你自己并没有创造现实。你只是诠释现实。而心灵的创造力旨在服务于一个更伟大的现实，它既存在于你的内在，存在于内识的伟大恩赐中，也存在于你之外，存在于整个宇宙的内识中。</p>
<p>When you make this discovery, which will likely arise in times of great self-doubt and disillusionment, then your life will begin to have promise. Until this happens, you are still trying to exhaust your ideas and your prescriptions. And as you age, the darkness of disappointment will grow. The sense of helplessness will haunt and pursue you. And you will constantly feel defeated by others and by the world.</p>
<p>当你发现这一点时——这很可能在你极度自我怀疑和幻灭的时刻出现——你的生命将开始充满希望。在此之前，你仍在努力耗尽你的想法和药方。随着年龄的增长，失望的阴霾会越来越浓重。无助感会萦绕并追赶你。你会不断地感到被他人和世界所挫败。</p>
<p>You need a greater power in your life. The greater power has already been given you. It is the great endowment. It is Knowledge. You may pray to God for many things—to be saved from this or to have that or even to save other people from calamity—but the real Gift has already been given you.</p>
<p>你的生命需要一种更伟大的力量。这个更伟大的力量已被赋予你。它是伟大的禀赋。它是内识。你或许会向上帝祈求许多事物——祈求从这拯救你，或拥有那个，甚至祈求拯救他人免于灾难——但真正的礼物已经被赋予你。</p>
<p>It is tragic that so few people in the world have discovered the Gift. They are still looking for the secret. They think it is just a secret: an idea, a plan, an understanding. Well, that is all of the mind.</p>
<p>可悲的是，世界上只有极少数人发现了这份礼物。他们仍在追寻其中的秘密。他们认为这只是一个秘密：一个想法、一个计划、一种理解。好吧，这不过是心灵的产物。</p>
<p>The Gift is the Gift of the Creator. The Creator knows that you cannot fulfill yourself here without Knowledge. The Creator knows that humanity will fail without Knowledge. The Creator knows that your relationships and all your attempts at satisfying your deeper needs will not be truly fulfilled without Knowledge.</p>
<p>这份礼物是造物主的礼物。造物主知道，如果没有内识，你无法在此成就你自己。造物主知道，如果没有内识，人类将会失败。造物主知道，如果没有内识，你的人际关系以及你所有满足你更深层次需求的尝试都将无法真正实现。</p>
<p>When you can see this, it will bring such a sense of relief to you and so much gratitude. For you will see that though you have been trying to fulfill yourself in your state of separation and isolation, you are really not separate, and you are really not isolated, and that even if all your plans have failed, a Greater Plan in you can now emerge.</p>
<p>当你能够看到这一点时，它将为你带来如此巨大的解脱感和无限的感激。因为你将看到，尽管你一直在分离和孤立的状态中努力实现你自己，但你实际上并不分离，你实际上并不孤立，即使你所有的计划都失败了，一个更伟大的计划现在也能在你内在浮现。</p>
<p>This is when your life has promise. This is when your actions have a far-reaching benefit for others. Instead of you struggling to get a bigger piece of the pie, competing with everyone else who is struggling to get and keep a bigger piece of the pie, you will be operating on an entirely different foundation, guided by a far greater power than anything the mind itself can create.</p>
<p>这时，你的生命才有承诺。这时，你的行动才会给他人带来深远的益处。你不再需要努力争取更大的份额，也不再需要与所有努力争取并保住更大份额的人竞争，而是将在一个完全不同的基础上运作，受到一种远超心灵所能创造的任何力量的指引。</p>
<p>But the pathway here is very different from the path of attempting to fulfill yourself. Here instead of building an aggregate of ideas and beliefs, a complex and burdening belief system, you begin to open the mind. Instead of having answers, you become present to others and to the world. Instead of explaining the suffering of others and using the suffering of others to validate your own beliefs and ideas, you become present to others to offer whatever is needed to them.</p>
<p>但这条道路与试图实现你自己的道路截然不同。在这里，你不再构建一堆想法和信念，不再构建一个复杂而沉重的信念体系，而是开始打开你的心灵。你不再寻求答案，而是展现在他人和世界面前。你不再解释他人的痛苦，也不再用他人的痛苦来验证你自己的信念和想法，而是展现在他人和世界面前，为他们提供一切所需。</p>
<p>You become one less person that is judging, criticizing and condemning the world. You become one less person who is only here to consume for their own benefit. You become one less person who is demanding that others believe what they believe, to conform to what they determine what is right and rightful.</p>
<p>你不再是一个评判、批评和谴责这个世界的人。你不再是一个只为自身利益而消费的人。你不再是一个要求其他人相信他们所相信的、遵守他们所认定的正确和正当的人。</p>
<p>Here you become a peacemaker because you are bringing the Presence with you, not because you have a whole idea about what peace is and how it can be achieved.</p>
<p>在这里，你成为一个和平缔造者，因为你带来了存在，而不是因为你对和平是什么以及如何实现和平有一个完整的概念。</p>
<p>Unless your role in life is to be a negotiator in conflict resolution and you are very, very well educated in this, do not pretend that you know or can assume you can understand with your simple ideas how nations and groups of people can be brought to a place of cooperation with one another.</p>
<p>除非你在生命中的角色是成为解决冲突的谈判者，并且你在这方面受过非常非常良好的教育，否则不要假装你知道或假设你能用你的简单想法理解如何让国家和人群之间进行合作。</p>
<p>Do not be arrogant unless you know a great deal about these subjects. In fact, have no opinions about things that you know little about, for that is arrogant and ignorant together, a very unfortunate combination.</p>
<p>除非你对这些领域知道颇深，否则不要傲慢自大。事实上，对于你不太知道的事情，不要发表任何意见，因为那既是傲慢，又是无知，这是一种非常不幸的组合。</p>
<p>Here instead of adding to your ideas, adding to your possessions, adding to your beliefs until the mind becomes like concrete where it can only defend its position, where it can only defend its ideas, where it itself becomes just another antagonist and combatant in a life full of antagonists and combatants, instead you come with the mind being open to see and to know and to wait for the moment of action.</p>
<p>在这里，你不需要增加你的想法、增加你的财产、增加你的信仰，直到你的心灵变得像混凝土一样，它只能捍卫它的立场、只能捍卫它自己的想法，它本身成为生命中充满对立和争斗的另一方对立者和战斗者，相反，你敞开心扉、去看见、去知道，并等待行动的那一刻。</p>
<p>Here you are unburdened of assumptions and beliefs and admonitions. Here you are not defending an ideology. You are coming to serve in any way that Knowledge can indicate for you to serve. Here the mind is subservient instead of pretending that it is dominant.</p>
<p>在这里，你卸下了假设、信仰和劝诫的负担。在这里，你不再捍卫某种意识形态。你以内识指引你去服务的任何方式前来服务。在这里，心灵处于服从状态，而非假装主导。</p>
<p>It is amazing that people’s greatest success arises out of their sense of failure. When you finally give up the hopeless pursuit of fulfilling yourself and trying to make Separation work, well, you will feel like such a failure.</p>
<p>令人惊奇的是，人们最大的成功往往源于他们的失败感。当你最终放弃实现你自己的无望追求，并试图让分离奏效时，你会觉得自己真是个失败者。</p>
<p>But really what is happening is you are opening yourself to the presence of Knowledge. Only it knows how to guide and protect you. Only Knowledge knows how you will be able to navigate the Great Waves of change that are coming, the difficult times ahead.</p>
<p>但实际上，你正在向内识的存在敞开你自己。只有它知道如何指引和保护你。只有内识知道你将如何驾驭即将到来的变革巨浪，以及未来的艰难时期。</p>
<p>These things are always either neglected or disputed by people who are trying to create their own reality because you will not have any time to create your own reality if you have to deal with all these circumstances, these difficulties and challenges. People will not have time to sit around dreaming of such things if their life is imperiled, if the foundation of their existence is challenged and is eroding away from underneath them.</p>
<p>这些事情总是被那些试图创造他们自己现实的人们忽视或质疑，因为如果你必须应对所有这些境况、这些困难和挑战，你将没有时间去创造你自己现实。如果人们的生命受到威胁，如果他们的生存基础受到挑战并正在被侵蚀，他们就没有时间坐下来梦想这些事情。</p>
<p>The truth is you need these challenges, or you will simply continue to dream and sleep—dreaming of what you could be and have and do, dreaming and dreaming and dreaming. Meanwhile, your life is neglected. The world goes unrecognized and unsupported by you. You are caught up in a hopeless trap of attempting and failing to fulfill yourself, hoping the next great idea, the next great proposition that comes along, will make all the difference.</p>
<p>真理是，你需要这些挑战，否则你只会继续沉睡在梦乡——梦想着你能成为什么样的人，拥有什么样的生活，做什么样的事，不断地梦想。与此同时，你的生命被忽视了。世界不再认可你，也不再支持你。你陷入了一个绝望的陷阱，不断尝试却最终失败，希望下一个伟大的想法，下一个伟大的提议，能够带来巨大的改变。</p>
<p>What is being presented here is of immense value and importance. It is the thing which can liberate you. But you must have the openness, the humility and the trust in Knowledge within yourself and within others to be able to embark on such a journey, a journey that is so different from the journey that perhaps you are accustomed to.</p>
<p>这里呈现的事情有着极大的价值和重要性。它是能够解放你的事情。但你必须拥有开放、谦逊，以及对你自己和他人内在内识的信任，才能开启这样一段旅程，一段或许与你习以为常的旅程截然不同的旅程。</p>
<p>The New Message from God is here to provide the Steps to Knowledge so that people everywhere—from every faith tradition, in every nation, from every background—will have the possibility, the chance, to find the great endowment for themselves.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息在这里提供了内识进阶，以便世界各地的人们——来自各种信仰传统、各个国家、各个背景——都能够拥有可能性和机会，去发现他们自己的伟大禀赋。</p>
<p>This great endowment is not a secret. It is a Gift. It is not something that a few people know about it, but they have not been telling anyone else. No, it is a Gift. It is the Gift in you. Only it knows what this Gift is, how it can be expressed, what it will look like, how it will manifest, who will need to come to you to assist you in bringing forth this Gift and where it will need to be placed and so forth.</p>
<p>这个伟大的禀赋并非一个秘密。它是一份礼物。它并非只有少数人知晓，却从未向他人透露。不，它是一份礼物。它是你内在的礼物。只有它知道这份礼物是什么，它如何被表达，它将是什么样子，它将如何显现，谁需要来到你身边，协助你带来这份礼物，以及它需要被放置于何处等等。</p>
<p>Here you must be willing to assist Knowledge. Here you must be willing to not be God in your universe, but part of Creation itself. Here you have a real possibility to become a force for good, for your life is meant to be a contribution to a world in need.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须愿意协助内识。在这里，你必须愿意不再成为你们宇宙中的上帝，而是成为创造它本身的一部分。在这里，你拥有真正成为一股善的力量的可能性，因为你的生命注定要为一个需要的世界做出贡献。</p>
<p>You are meant to come into the world at this time, under these circumstances, and to face and prepare for the Great Waves of change that are coming. And you make a contribution to the world in the face of these great challenges and difficulties.</p>
<p>你注定要在这个时候、在这种情况下来到这个世界，面对即将到来的变革巨浪，并为之做好准备。你在这些伟大的挑战和困难面前，为世界做出了贡献。</p>
<p>Have the humility, then, to realize you do not know how to do this. You do not know what it will look like. And you do not really understand what it means. But it is in you to bring this Gift forth. It is there.</p>
<p>那么，请谦逊地意识到，你不知道该如何做到这一点。你不知道它会是什么样子。你也不真正理解它的意义。但这份礼物的诞生就在你心中。它就在那里。</p>
<p>Do not judge others then. For if you are honest with yourself, you will see how long it has taken for you to even come to the beginning of this journey and to recognize the need for Knowledge.</p>
<p>那么，不要评判他人。因为如果你对你自己诚实，你就会看到，你花了多长时间才踏上这段旅程，并认识到对内识的需求。</p>
<p>Understand that everyone is either trying to fulfill their ideas or they are coming to Knowledge. And there are so many steps in between these two very different understandings and ways of life, and people are strung out along the pathway. You who can hardly understand your deeper nature are not in a position to judge and evaluate others.</p>
<p>要理解，每个人要么在努力实现他们的想法，要么在走向内识。在这两种截然不同的理解和生命方式之间存在着如此多的台阶，人们沿着这条道路蜿蜒前行。你几乎无法理解你更深层次的自然，因此无法评判和评价他人。</p>
<p>The great dilemmas of the world, the tragedies of the world, may seem incomprehensible. But they are not God proof. You do not need to figure everything out. You just need to follow the way that Knowledge will take you. It will take you there without your ideas, beliefs and understanding, necessarily.</p>
<p>世界上的重大困境，世界上的悲剧，或许看似难以理解。但它们并非上帝无法证明。你无需弄清楚一切。你只需遵循内识将引领你的道路。它会带你到达那里，无需你的想法、信仰和理解。</p>
<p>Some of these things may continue to be useful to you in your journey, but you are a follower now and not a leader. But you are a follower following something within you. You are becoming inner directed rather than simply controlled and manipulated by the immensely powerful forces in the mental environment around you—forces of your family, your religion, your government, your social group, your friends and whatever ideology they espouse.</p>
<p>这些事情中的一些或许会继续在你的旅程中对你有用，但你现在是一名追随者，而非领导者。但你是一名追随者，追随你内在的内识。你正在变得由内在引导，而不是简单地被你周围心理环境中那些极其强大的力量——你的家庭、你的宗教、你的政府、你的社会群体、你的朋友以及他们所信奉的任何意识形态——所控制和操纵。</p>
<p>Knowledge is here for people from all walks of life, all religions, all ideologies because every ideology has some value and merit, but only Knowledge within you and within others can use this merit and this value. That is the power and the wisdom of Knowledge.</p>
<p>内识面向各行各业、各宗教、各意识形态的人们，因为每种意识形态都有其价值和功绩，但只有你和他人内在的内识才能运用这种功绩和价值。这就是内识的力量和智慧。</p>
<p>You have an opportunity to be a witness to this growing and emerging and expressing itself through your life. And this, indeed, will be the miracle that will renew to you your fundamental relationship with yourself, with others, with the world and with God. This is the Gift, and it is waiting to express itself through you.</p>
<p>你有机会见证这个成长、涌现，并通过你的生命表达它自身。这确实会是一个奇迹，它将更新你与你自己、与他人、与世界以及与上帝的根本关系。这是一份礼物，内识正等待着通过你表达它自己。</p>
