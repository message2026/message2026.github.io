<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on August 5, 2008 in Seattle, Washington<br>2008 年 8 月 5 日，在华盛顿州西雅图(Seattle, Washington)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone experiences anger and frustration. There are many things that create frustration and that generate anger. Certainly, failed expectations is one cause. Having your desires be thwarted or held back is another cause. And being unwilling or unable to express your deeper feelings is another cause of anger and frustration. Each of these three causes, you see, can be mitigated and worked out over time, often with assistance from others, sometimes with professional assistance.</p>
<p>每个人都会经历愤怒和沮丧。许多事情都会造成沮丧和愤怒。当然，期望落空是其中一个原因。愿望受挫或被抑制是另一个原因。不愿或无法表达内心深处的感受也是导致愤怒和沮丧的另一个原因。你看，这三个原因都可以随着时间的推移得到缓解和解决，通常需要他人的帮助，有时也需要专业人士的帮助。</p>
<p>Certainly, to have your desires disappointed is something that can be moderated, depending upon how you relate to your own desires and how authentic those desires really are. Where do they come from within yourself? Are they mere wishes? Are they emotional needs or attachments? Or do they represent a deeper need within you?</p>
<p>当然，欲望落空是可以缓和的，这取决于你如何看待你自身的欲望，以及这些欲望的实际程度。它们源自你自己的内心深处？它们仅仅是愿望吗？是情感需求还是执着？还是它们代表着你内心一种更深层次的需求？</p>
<p>To have your expectations disappointed is simply part of life. There are so many things that are not as wonderful as you expect them to be. The thrill of ownership, for example, is very short lived, soon to be replaced by the burden of ownership. Love and romance can be quickly replaced by the difficulty of establishing an honest and meaningful relationship with another, based upon a greater purpose in life and personal compatibility. Certainly your expectations of yourself will be disappointing as you find yourself unable or unwilling to fulfill these expectations.</p>
<p>期望落空只是生命的一部分。很多事情并不像你期望的那样美好。例如，拥有的兴奋感非常短暂，很快就会被拥有的负担所取代。爱情和浪漫很快就会被与他人在生命中建立一种基于更伟大目的和个人契合度的真诚而有意义的关系的困难所取代。当然，当你发现你自己无法或不愿实现这些期望时，你对你自己的期望也会令人失望。</p>
<p>Therefore, having disappointed expectations is simply part of life and can be very maturing if one understands this correctly, if one can re-evaluate their own expectations to see what is really realistic and what is not, what can really be fulfilled and what cannot. And do these expectations represent simply the fascinations or the fantasies of the mind, or do they represent deeper psychological or emotional needs or, even beyond this, do they represent a deeper need of the soul?</p>
<p>因此，期望落空只是生命的一部分，如果一个人正确理解了这一点，如果一个人能够重新评估自己的期望，看清什么是真正现实的，什么不是，什么真正能够实现，什么无法实现，那么这可以非常促进成熟。这些期望仅仅代表着心灵的迷恋或幻想，还是它们代表着更深层次的心理或情感需求，或者，甚至超越这一点，它们代表着灵魂的一种更深层次的需求？</p>
<p>The difficulty in expressing one’s feelings is generated by many forces: inhibition within oneself, social conditioning, social responsibility. It takes a lifetime to learn how to recognize, experience and express constructively one’s own deeper experiences. While your culture may require you to behave in a civil and pleasant manner, that does not reflect your deeper experience. Therefore, one must find ways of learning to recognize one’s deeper experience and finding ways to express this constructively.</p>
<p>表达情感的困难源于诸多因素：自身压抑、社会环境、社会责任。学习如何认识、体验并建设性地表达自身更深层次的体验，需要一生的时间。你的文化或许要求你举止文明礼貌，但这并不能反映你更深层次的体验。因此，你必须找到学习认识自身更深层次体验的方法，并找到建设性地表达它的方法。</p>
<p>But in Our discourse today We are going to speak of a deeper cause for anger and frustration, a deeper cause that cannot simply be resolved through working with one’s own psychology and one’s own personal dynamics. For while you may moderate your expectations, while you may moderate your desires, while you may learn constructive ways of expressing deeper feelings with other people or with certain people, there remains a deeper cause for anger and frustration. If this deeper cause is not recognized and addressed, well, one will have to live continuously with a lack of fulfillment and recognition at a deeper level. And this will produce a kind of very irrational anger and frustration.</p>
<p>但在今天的讲话中，我们将探讨愤怒和挫折的一种更深层次的原因，这种更深层次的原因无法仅仅通过调整自身的心理和个人动力来解决。因为，尽管你可以调整你的期望，尽管你可以调整你的欲望，尽管你可以学习建设性地向他人或某些人表达更深层次的感受，但愤怒和挫折仍然存在更深层次的原因。如果不认出和解决这个更深层次的原因，那么，你将不得不在更深层次上持续生活在缺乏满足感和认同感的境况中。这将产生一种非常非理性的愤怒和挫折。</p>
<p>Even if you have learned to be in life with very few expectations, even if you were very open and accommodating, you would still have this deeper need, this deeper issue to address. Even if you had learned through time and through difficult learning situations how to recognize and express your deeper emotions with certain people in a constructive way, you will still have this deeper need, this deeper frustration within yourself. Even if you have moderated your attitudes and your beliefs, even if you have become very flexible and compassionate, very tolerant—all important aspects, of course—even if you had developed these over time and through much effort, you would still have this deeper need, this deeper frustration and a deeper cause for anger.</p>
<p>即使你已经学会了在生命中不抱有太多期望，即使你非常开放和包容，你依然会有这种更深层次的需求，这个更深层次的问题需要解决。即使你通过时间和艰难的学习境遇学会了如何以建设性的方式认知并与某些人表达你更深层次的情感，你依然会有这种更深层次的需求，你自己内在的这种更深层次的挫败感。即使你已经调整了你的态度和信仰，即使你变得非常灵活、富有同情心、非常宽容——当然，这些都是重要的方面——即使你随着时间的推移和通过大量努力发展了这些，你依然会有这种更深层次的需求，这种更深层次的挫败感和一种更深层次的愤怒根源。</p>
<p>So while it is important to address the problem of anger and frustration at the level of your personal dynamics and psychology, at the level of your desires and expectations and need to express yourself effectively with other people, there is a deeper calling here.</p>
<p>因此，虽然在个人动力和心理层面、在愿望和期望层面以及需要与他人有效表达自己的层面解决愤怒和沮丧的问题很重要，但这里面还有更深层次的召唤。</p>
<p>If you are not living the life you are really meant to live, you will be dissatisfied. Even if you have created idyllic circumstances, even if you have positioned yourself for a life of great comfort and aesthetic pleasure, you will be very dissatisfied. If you are not living and doing what you came here to live and to do, well, the enhancement of your environment or the manipulation of your psychology will not be enough to counteract the deep dissatisfaction and frustration you will feel about your life.</p>
<p>如果你没有过上你真正应该过的生命，你就会感到不满。即使你已经创造了田园诗般的环境，即使你已经为你自己的生命定位，让你自己过上舒适惬意、美观愉悦的生活，你也会非常不满意。如果你没有按照你来这里的目的去生活和做事，那么，改善你的环境或操纵你的心理，都不足以抵消你对生命所感受到的深深的不满和挫败感。</p>
<p>Here there must be a greater honesty. You can claim that you are living a greater purpose, that you are really doing what you came here to do. You can tell yourself this. You can assure other people of this. You can talk yourself into a belief about this. But if you are constantly frustrated, easily irritated, easily upset, then you can be sure that there is a deeper need within you that is going unmet.</p>
<p>在这里，必须有一种更伟大的诚实。你可以宣称你正生活在一种更伟大的目的之下，你真正在做你来此要做的事情。你可以这样告诉你自己。你可以向其他人保证这一点。你可以说服你自己相信这一点。但如果你不断感到沮丧、容易被激怒、容易心烦意乱，那么你可以肯定，你内在有一种更深层次的需求尚未得到满足。</p>
<p>The first step here is to recognize that you came into the world for a greater purpose. You did not simply wash up on the shore one day, a kind of biological accident, or some kind of mishap in the cosmos, or this just happened to be the place you happen to be. There is a greater purpose for you being here. But this purpose is kept deeply within you in a deeper consciousness.</p>
<p>第一步是认识到你来到这个世界是为了一个更伟大的目的。你并非某天被冲上岸，并非某种生物事故，亦非宇宙中的某种灾变，亦非你恰巧身处此地。你身处此地，背后有着更伟大的目的。但这个目的深藏于你内心深处的意识之中。</p>
<p>You cannot figure it out with your intellect. It is not a belief or a set of beliefs. If you are really honest with yourself, you must really acknowledge that you do not know what this is. Perhaps you have made strides in the right direction. Perhaps certain things have come into place within your life. Perhaps you have made real progress. But you cannot say definitively what this is because it is not a definition. It is not an idea. It is not a belief. It is not a declaration.</p>
<p>你无法用你的智力去理解它。它不是一种信念，也不是一种信仰体系。如果你对你自己真正诚实，你必然会承认你不知道它是什么。或许你已朝着正确的方向迈进。或许在你的生命中某些事情已经成真。或许你已经取得真正的进步。但你无法明确地说出它是什么，因为它不是一个定义。它不是一个想法。它不是一种信念。它不是一种宣告。</p>
<p>If you are moving in the right direction, you will feel a deeper resonance within yourself. If you are not, you will feel a disassociation with yourself, a kind of great wall between your conscious mind and your deeper reality.</p>
<p>如果你正朝着正确的方向前进，你会感受到你自己内在一种更深层次的共鸣。如果你的方向错误，你会感觉到与你自己的疏离，你的意识心灵和更深层次的现实之间仿佛有一堵高墙。</p>
<p>And while you may try to remain stimulated on the outside—preoccupied with a busy life, with overinvolvement with other people, with a full schedule—you are still facing this wall within yourself. It is as if you were living on the surface of the mind and had no idea what was down beneath the surface.</p>
<p>尽管你或许试图保持外在的活力——专注于忙碌的生活，过度参与他人，日程安排满满​​——但你仍然面临着内心的这堵墙。你仿佛生活在心灵的表面，对表面之下的事物一无所知。</p>
<p>This is the tragedy for so many people. They are working so hard to have a good life. They are exerting so much effort to try to acquire the relationships and the possessions and the opportunities for themselves, and yet they have not passed through this great barrier within themselves that keeps them from feeling and knowing and experiencing a deeper movement and direction in their lives.</p>
<p>这对许多人来说是个悲剧。他们如此努力地工作，想要拥有美好的生活。他们如此努力地试图为他们自己获取关系、财产和机会，然而他们却未能跨越他们自身内在的这道巨大障碍，这道障碍阻碍着他们的感受、知道和体验他们生命中一种更深层次的运动和方向。</p>
<p>So even if they are successful in worldly terms and have achieved many of their goals, have been successful while others have failed, have achieved a financial stability or even affluence, they are unknown to themselves. They think they are their minds and their thoughts and their beliefs and their attitudes and their psychological aspects. They identify with the surface, but they have no real sense of themselves.</p>
<p>所以，即使他们在世俗层面上取得了成功，实现了许多目标，在其他人失败时他们成功，实现了经济稳定甚至富裕，他们仍然对他们自己一无所知。他们认为他们就是他们的心灵、他们的思想、他们的信仰、他们的态度和他们的心理层面。他们认同于表面，却没有真正的自我感受。</p>
<p>So no matter what they acquire for themselves, their pleasures are small, and their frustration is great, and they work like slaves to have these things. And, as is often the case, they are dishonest with themselves and with other people to try to gain advantage, to try to look good, to try to win approval and favor.</p>
<p>所以，无论他们为他们自己获得什么，他们的快乐都很少，而他们的挫败感却很大，为了得到这些东西，他们像奴隶一样工作。而且，正如通常的情况一样，他们对他们自己和他人不诚实，试图获取利益，试图让他们自己看起来更好，试图赢得认可和青睐。</p>
<p>As a result, their life is a kind of sham. It is inauthentic. It is all for show. They identify with their possessions, with their house, with their job, with their social standing. They have no real sense of themselves, and sadly this greatly limits their ability to experience any kind of affinity with anyone or anything in life.</p>
<p>结果，他们的生命就像一场骗局，不真实，一切都是为了炫耀。他们认同他们的财产、房子、工作和社会地位。他们缺乏真正的自我感受，可悲的是，这极大地限制了他们与生命中任何人或任何事物建立亲密关系的能力。</p>
<p>So they are living in a kind of bubble, a bubble that is so easily threatened by a changing world and by the great changes that are coming to the world in the future. Their happiness is intermittent and short lived and easily threatened by life around them.</p>
<p>所以他们就像生活在一个泡沫里，一个很容易受到变化的世界以及未来世界巨变威胁的泡沫。他们的幸福断断续续、昙花一现，而且很容易受到周围生命的威胁。</p>
<p>Even if they have adopted a happy face, a happy behavior, within themselves there is roiling frustration. They are fighting depression. They are fighting inner conflict to put on a happy face to the world because they have not really connected with who they are, and why they are here in the world, and the deeper direction that their life is meant to go and was always meant to go.</p>
<p>即使他们摆出一副快乐的面孔，表现出快乐的行为，内心深处却翻腾着沮丧。他们在与抑郁作斗争。他们在与内心的冲突作斗争，试图用快乐的面孔面对世界，因为他们还没有真正地与他们是谁、为什么来到这个世界、以及他们生命本该走向的、一直以来注定要走向的更深层次的方向相联系。</p>
<p>If people choose another way, eventually they become so lost that to find their way back seems almost impossible. But God has placed a deeper Intelligence within each person, an Intelligence called Knowledge. And it does know the way back, for it has never left you, and it still possesses your greater purpose in life. Even if you were ninety-years-old and had lived a whole life, it still holds a greater purpose for you.</p>
<p>如果人们选择另一条路，最终他们会迷失方向，几乎不可能找到回归的路。但上帝在每个人的内在都放置了一种更深层次的智能，一种被称为内识的智能。它知道回归的路，因为它从未离开过你，它依然拥有你生命中的更伟大目的。即使你已经九十岁高龄，走过了漫长的人生，它依然为你保留着更伟大的目的。</p>
<p>But as you get older, you would have to be willing to backtrack. You would have to be willing to undo what you have created. You would have to be willing to challenge and question and even set aside longheld beliefs and attitudes. You would have to change your position with your friends and your family, who may not at all understand, recognize or support your attempt to regain a real connection with your deeper life. It is very difficult then. Not impossible, but difficult.</p>
<p>但随着年龄的增长，你必须愿意回溯。你必须愿意撤销你所创造的一切。你必须愿意挑战、质疑，甚至抛弃你长期持有的信念和态度。你必须改变你与朋友和家人的关系，他们可能根本不理解、不认可或支持你试图重新获得与更深层次生命的真正连接。那时，这将非常困难。并非不可能，但确实很困难。</p>
<p>It is like the hot and cold game. If you are honest with yourself, your life becomes warmer and more resonant. If you continue to maintain false ideas about yourself and give yourself to things that will not lead your life in the direction in which it is meant to go, your life will become colder and colder. You will be more slavish to your desires. You will be more upset with the world, and you will be more upset with other people, and you will be more upset with yourself.</p>
<p>它就像一场冷热游戏。如果你对你自己诚实，你的生命就会变得更温暖，更有共鸣。如果你继续对你自己抱有错误的想法，把你自己投入到那些不会引导你的生命朝着它应有方向的事物中，你的生命就会变得越来越冷淡。你会更加屈从于你的欲望。你会对世界更加不满，对别人更加不满，对你自己也更加不满。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you can bring you back, but it will take time. And it will not be easy because you have to undo so much, both in your outer life and within your own mind. This takes courage and strength and determination. You must face adversity and disappointment from other people. You must face uncertainty within yourself. You will doubt yourself, wondering if you are going crazy.</p>
<p>你内在的内识可以带你回归，但这需要时间。而且这并非易事，因为你需要清除太多东西，既包括你外在的生命，也包括你自身内在的心灵。这需要勇气、力量和决心。你必须面对逆境和来自他人的失望。你必须面对内心的不确定性。你会怀疑你自己，怀疑你是不是疯了。</p>
<p>“What am I doing to my life that I don’t want to do the things I have been doing? I don’t want to do them anymore. I am tired of shallow, meaningless relationships. I’m tired of being a slave, trying to acquire things of little value. My soul is hungry. It is needy. It needs real connection with people. It needs a meaningful life and I am not living that life. My life is a pretense. It is an accommodation to other people. It is a sacrifice for wealth or beauty or advantage.”</p>
<p>我到底在做什么，以至于我不想再做那些我一直在做的事情？我再也不想做了。我厌倦了肤浅、毫无意义的人际关系。我厌倦了做奴隶，试图获取那些毫无价值的东西。我的灵魂饥渴难耐，它需要满足。它需要与人建立真正的联系。它需要一种有意义的生命，而我没有过上那样的生命。我的生命只是一种伪装。它是为了迎合他人。它是为了财富、美貌或优势而做出的牺牲。</p>
<p>There is a really difficult reckoning here when you realize that your life is really not what it must be. You are not living the life you were meant to live. You are not being true to yourself. You have gone far afield and must now find your way back.</p>
<p>当你意识到你的生命并非如你所愿时，你会感到非常艰难。你没有活出你本该过的生命。你没有忠于你自己。你已经偏离正轨，现在必须找到回归的路。</p>
<p>You have become lost in the world. It has captured you. It has conditioned you. It has persuaded you to be a certain way, to act a certain way, to behave a certain way, to meet certain social requirements, to meet the expectation of your family or your culture or religion or all of the above. And you feel lost.</p>
<p>你已经迷失在这个世界里。它俘获了你，它制约了你。它说服你成为某​​种人，以某种方式行事，以某种方式举止，去满足某些社会要求，去满足你的家庭、文化、宗教或以上所有一切的期望。你感到迷失。</p>
<p>Somehow you cannot shake this feeling anymore. You cannot lose yourself in constant stimulation. You cannot lose yourself in your job. You cannot lose yourself in pursuing romance. You cannot lose yourself in your hobbies or your fascinations because fundamentally you are not right with yourself. And if you are not right with yourself, you are not right with the people you are with. You are not right with your circumstances. Everything is out of sync because you are out of sync.</p>
<p>不知何故，你再也无法摆脱这种感觉。你无法迷失你自己，无法迷失在持续不断的刺激中。你无法迷失你自己，无法迷失在工作中。你无法迷失你自己，无法迷失在追求的爱情中。你无法迷失你自己，无法迷失在爱好或迷恋中，因为从根本上来说，你无法与你自己相处。如果你无法与你自己相处，你也无法与你身边的人相处。你无法与你的处境相处。一切都不同步了，因为你不同步。</p>
<p>And you are frustrated. And you have a kind of anger that does not seem to be related to anything in particular. It can be stimulated by disappointment. It can be stimulated by your inability to express yourself. It can be stimulated by disappointment in the world. But it really is something else. It is more fundamental and it is more protracted within you.</p>
<p>你感到沮丧。你心中有一种愤怒，似乎与任何特定事物无关。它可能因失望而起，也可能因你无法表达你自己而起，也可能因对世界的失望而起。但它实际上是别的东西。它更根本，也更持久地存在于你的内心。</p>
<p>You can tell yourself, “Well, I am living such a wonderful life. I have so many advantages, or at least I am better off than those people over there. So many worse things could be happening to me, so I should be thankful. I should be grateful,” but inside, something is really missing. And you cannot talk yourself out of it because you are not right with yourself. You are not living the life you are meant to live.</p>
<p>你可以告诉你自己：“嗯，我的生活如此美好。我有很多优势，或者至少我比那边的人过得好。很多更糟糕的事情可能会发生在我身上，所以我应该心存感激。我应该感恩。” 但内心深处，你真的缺少了一些东西。你无法说服你自己放弃，因为你对你自己不满意。你没有过上你应该过的生命。</p>
<p>While other people seem to be content or perhaps, more correctly, resigned to their circumstances, you cannot seem to do this anymore. You cannot simply resign yourself and say, “Well, it is really okay. It is life. It is what I must do,” because it is not honest. It does not matter that everyone seems to be fairly satisfied. It is your own recognition within yourself.</p>
<p>当其他人似乎对他们的处境感到满足，或者更确切地说，是顺从时，你似乎再也无法做到这一点了。你不能简单地听天由命地说：“嗯，这真的没关系。这就是生命。这是我必须做的。”因为这不诚实。每个人看起来都相当满意，它是无关紧要的。它是你自己对你自身的认知。</p>
<p>It is like God has hooked you, and you are a fish, and it takes a long time to reel you in because you are so far out there. You are so resistant. And you are fighting, and you are struggling, and God is reeling you in. But you are fighting, and you are struggling, and you are trying to go somewhere else. You are overcommitted to a life that is not really your real life.</p>
<p>它就像上帝把你钓了起来，而你是一条鱼，你游得太远了，要花很长时间才能把你拉回来。你如此抗拒。你在抗争，你在挣扎，上帝正在把你拉回来。但你仍在抗争，仍在挣扎，你试图去别的地方。你过度投入于一种并非你真正生命的生命。</p>
<p>It is so important here to come to face this because life on the outside will continue to be frustrating and disappointing. And you will continue to have difficulty expressing yourself with other people. But you must come to terms with this and face this question: “Am I really living the life I’m meant to live? Not that I want to live, but that I am meant to live, that I must live.”</p>
<p>面对这一点至关重要，因为外面的生命仍会继续令人沮丧和失望。你也会继续难以与他人表达你自己。但你必须接受这一点，并面对这个问题：“我真的过着我本该过的生命吗？不是我想要的生活，而是我注定要过的生活，我必须活下去。”</p>
<p>If you are not sure, then you need to keep asking. Ask yourself: “Will I be content living the rest of my life under these circumstances and with my current understanding and current values?” It is really asking the same question but using different words. “Am I really fulfilling my greater abilities and potential here? Am I really doing what God sent me into the world to do? Am I really engaged with the right people? Am I really in the right place, engaged in the right activities?”</p>
<p>如果你不确定，那么你需要不断追问。问问你自己：“在这样的境况下，以我目前的理解和价值观，我会满足于度过余生吗？”这实际上是用不同的措辞问同一个问题。“我是否真的在充分发挥我更大的能力和潜力？我是否真的在做上帝派我来到这个世界要我做的事？我是否真的在和对的人交往？我是否真的在对的地方，从事对的活动？”</p>
<p>These questions are all very similar because they are attempting to penetrate a deeper reality within yourself and ask very fundamental questions about your life. You may not have an answer to these questions right away, but the fact that you are asking them and continuing to ask them, that is what is important.</p>
<p>这些问题都非常相似，因为它们试图洞察你自己内在一种更深层次的现实，并提出关于你生命的根本问题。你可能无法立即找到这些问题的答案，但重要的是，你正在提出这些问题，并持续不断地提出它们。</p>
<p>These are not questions that are intellectual games. They are not questions you can simply answer with a statement or a sentence or a definition. They are inquiries. They are explorations.</p>
<p>这些问题并非智力游戏。它们不是你能用一个陈述、一个句子或一个定义就能简单回答的问题。它们是探究，是探索。</p>
<p>It is like you are mining for gold. The nuggets are not sitting out on the surface, and you just pick them up. You will have to dig for them. Here you have to dig within yourself. Take time out from your busy, overwrought schedule and begin to concern yourself with these kinds of questions.</p>
<p>它就像你在挖金子。金块并不在地表，你只是捡起来而已。你必须挖掘它们。在这里，你必须挖掘你自己的内心。从你繁忙、紧张的日程中抽出时间，开始思考这些问题。</p>
<p>So the first thing to understand is you were born with a greater purpose. The second thing to understand is that Knowledge, this deeper Intelligence that God has placed within you, knows this purpose and is keeping it for you—awaiting the time when you desire it, and helping you to prepare for it, guiding you and protecting you for this greater purpose.</p>
<p>因此，首先要理解的是，你生来就肩负着一个更伟大的目的。其次要理解的是，内识，上帝置于你内在的这个更深层次的智能，知道这个目的，并为你守护它——正等待着你渴望它的那一刻，帮助你为它做准备，引导你，保护你，以应对这个更伟大的目的。</p>
<p>It is not an intellectual understanding. You will not walk around every day having a firm conviction and belief that you know why you are here and what you are doing because it is not like that. You have to live this. It reveals itself as you live it. People want the answer before they will do the investigation. They want to know what the outcome is going to be before they involve themselves. It is not like this.</p>
<p>它不是智力上的理解。你不会每天都带着坚定的信念和信仰四处走动，认为你知道你为什么在这里，知道你在做什么，因为事实并非如此。你必须亲身经历。当你亲身经历时，它就会显现出来。人们在进行调查之前就想要得到答案。他们想知道结果会如何，然后才会介入。它不是这样的。</p>
<p>It is like taking a journey, a journey you did not create for yourself, a journey that has been waiting for you for so very long. You take it because you must know the truth about your life.</p>
<p>它就像踏上一段旅程，一段并非你为你自己创造的旅程，一段等待你已久的旅程。你踏上旅程，是因为你必须知道你生命的真理。</p>
<p>Perhaps you have tasted enough sorrow and pleasure in this world to realize that they are only tastes and they do not represent who and what you really are; that you cannot be satisfied with what other people are trying to be satisfied with; that you are not in the world to simply be a consumer, a locust upon the world, consuming everything in sight; that there is really a greater purpose for your coming and for your being here.</p>
<p>或许你在这个世界上已经品尝了足够多的悲伤和快乐，从而意识到它们只是尝尝味道而已，它们并不代表你真正是谁与你是什么；你无法满足于其他人试图满足的东西；你身处这个世界并非只是为了成为一个消费者，一只蝗虫，吞噬眼前的一切；你的到来和你在此的存在，确实有着一个更伟大目的。</p>
<p>You will not discover this all at once. You will discover it in stages. And each stage will require you to adjust your life, your expectations, your desires and your attempt to communicate with other people.</p>
<p>你不会一下子就发现这一切。你会分阶段发现它。每个阶段都需要你调整你的生命、你的期望、你的渴望以及你与他人沟通的尝试。</p>
<p>Until you really have a deeper experience of yourself and your greater purpose here, even your emotions will not make any sense to you. You will not even know what you want to communicate to people. You cannot just communicate frustration. That is kind of destructive; that is unpleasant. You cannot go around screaming at people because you have given yourself the freedom to express anger and frustration. That will not work.</p>
<p>除非你真正对你自己以及你在此的更伟大目的有了一种更深层次的体验，否则就连你的情绪对你来说也毫无意义。你甚至不知道你想和人们沟通什么。你不能只是传达挫败感。那有点破坏性；那令人不快。你不能到处冲别人大喊大叫，因为你已经给了你自己表达愤怒和挫败感的自由。那行不通。</p>
<p>So you have to do this inner work, you see, because if you do not, you are just going to be an angry, frustrated person whether you are rich or whether you are poor. And your anger will be projected out onto the world, onto other people, onto governments, onto politics, onto religion—lashing out here, lashing out there, when inside, you are basically not right with yourself, living a life that is not real, living a life that is an accommodation to others, a compromise.</p>
<p>所以你必须做好内心的功课，因为如果你不这样做，无论贫富，你都只会是一个愤怒、沮丧的人。你的愤怒会被投射到这个世界，投射到其他人身上，投射到政府、政治、宗教上——四处攻击，而你的内心却发现自己根本就不自在，过着一种不真实的生命，过着迁就他人、妥协的生命。</p>
<p>Of course, you will be frustrated. Of course, you will be angry. How could you be otherwise? You cannot simply meditate all day and be at peace if you are not right with yourself.</p>
<p>当然，你会感到沮丧。当然，你会生气。不然你还能怎样？如果你的自我感觉不好，你就不可能整天冥想，获得内心的平静。</p>
<p>Being right with yourself is having a continual experience, an ongoing experience of being connected to a deeper movement in your life. It is not simply a psychological exercise where you manipulate your thinking or you manipulate your emotions and all of a sudden you are in a nice peaceful place. And it does not matter if you attain a peaceful state in some other reality but still are unable to function here successfully. What difference will that make?</p>
<p>与你自己相处是一种持续的体验，一种与生命中更深层次的运动相连接的持续体验。它并非简单的心理练习，你操控你的思维或情绪，然后突然间你就进入了一种美好的和平境界。即使你在另一个现实中达到了和平的状态，但在这里仍然无法成功运作，它也无关紧要。这又有什么区别呢？</p>
<p>You meditate for hours every day and you get into a wonderfully quiet and quiescent state, and you are very open, but as soon as you come back, well, you are still the same frustrated personality—facing disappointment, having difficulty communicating to other people, failed expectations, failed desires, failed communication. You have all these problems, you see.</p>
<p>你每天冥想几个小时，进入一种奇妙的宁静祥和的状态，心胸开阔，但一旦冥想回来，你还是那个沮丧的性格——面对失望，难以与他人沟通，期望落空，愿望落空，沟通失败。你看，你面临所有这些问题。</p>
<p>So if you are doing fine at some other level of consciousness, well, if it is not really translating into a greater ability here, then what difference does it make? You are just going to retreat into the monastery for the rest of your life? Trying to live in bliss? That is not why you have come here.</p>
<p>所以，如果你在其他意识层面上做得很好，但在这里却无法真正转化为一种更伟大的能力，那又有什么区别呢？你就打算在寺院里隐居一辈子吗？想活得逍遥自在吗？这不是你来这里的目的。</p>
<p>What is being presented here is so fundamental to your sense of well-being, to your sense of integrity, to having a real experience of yourself and a sense that your life is being moved in a greater direction. People have not had this experience sufficiently to really see it in contrast to everything else that they do.</p>
<p>这里呈现的，对于你的幸福感、你完整性的感觉、拥有真实的自我体验，以及你的生命正朝着更伟大方向发展的感觉，都至关重要。人们尚未拥有足够的这种体验，以至于无法真正地将其与他们所经历的其他一切进行对比来看待。</p>
<p>If you have never experienced your life really being moved in a deeper or greater direction, then you will just try to live your life based upon your wishes and your desires and the wishes and desires of other people. You will be happy to be part of the herd, and you will live your life eating grass.</p>
<p>如果你从未真正体验过你的生命被推向一种更深层次或更伟大的方向，那么你只会试图按照你的愿望、你的渴望以及他人的愿望和渴望来生活。你会乐于成为群体的一部分，你的一生只会吃草。</p>
<p>The cause of suffering at a deeper level, at a more fundamental level, and not merely at the surface, has to do with one’s inability or unwillingness to explore and face the reality and the greater purpose of their life.</p>
<p>造成痛苦的更深层次的原因，不仅仅是表面上的，而且是更根本的原因，是人们无力或不愿意探索和面对现实以及他们生命的更伟大目的。</p>
<p>You could say suffering is the result of attachment. Well, attachment to outer things does create suffering, but the answer is not complete. To become more unattached may make you a little freer, but it does not answer the fundamental question of who you are and why you are here, what you are doing and what you are giving yourself to.</p>
<p>你可以说痛苦源于执着。嗯，对外在事物的执着确实会造成痛苦，但答案并不完整。更加不执着或许会让你更自由一些，但这并不能回答你是谁、你为什么在这里、你在做什么、你在为什么付出的根本问题。</p>
<p>You cannot simply withdraw from the outside, searching for peace, because at the level of your soul, the need of your soul will still be unmet. You will still be discontented. You will still be frustrated. And your desire for peace is like a kind of escape.</p>
<p>你不能简单地从外界撤退，去寻求和平，因为在你灵魂的层面上，你灵魂的需求仍然没有得到满足。你仍然会感到不满。你仍然会感到沮丧。而你对平静的渴望就像是一种逃避。</p>
<p>All the work that was done to bring you into the world is considerable. To have you be here and simply want to leave does not fulfill your purpose, nor the purpose of those who have brought you here. You have been sent into the world to give specific gifts within specific situations, involving certain people. If you just want to escape, to be happy, to be at peace, to avoid the challenges and the difficulties of life, well, you are not fulfilling your purpose.</p>
<p>把你带到这个世界，付出了巨大的努力。让你来到这个世界，你却只想着离开，这既不符合你的目的，也不符合那些把你带到这里的存在的目的。你被派到这个世界，是为了在特定的境遇中，与特定的人，给予特定的礼物。如果你只是想逃避，想要快乐，想要和平，想要逃避生命中的挑战和困难，那么，你就没有实现你的目的。</p>
<p>You can be at peace when you leave this world. But you have come here to contribute, to serve, not just to invest in your own happiness. And how dishonest you will become with yourself in your pursuit of happiness. You will only want to see certain things. You will only want to hear certain things that support your pursuit for happiness. You will not want to see suffering. You will not want to see conflict. You will not want to see most of the realities of life here. You will not want to face the really difficult questions about your life. You will not want to have to do any real work within yourself or work within the world, seeking now only reprieve.</p>
<p>当你离开这个世界时，你可以感到和平。但你来到这里是为了贡献，是为了服务，而不仅仅是为了投资你自己的幸福。而在追求幸福的过程中，你将变得多么不诚实。你将只想看到某些特定的事情。你将只想听到特定支持你追求幸福的话语。你不想看到苦难。你不想看到冲突。你不想看到这里生命中的大多数现实。你不想面对关于你生命的真正难题。你不想在内心做任何真正的工作，也不想在这个世界做任何真正的工作，现在只想寻求喘息。</p>
<p>That is not why you are here. Do not waste your life trying to secure happiness at the expense of the greater purpose that has brought you here, for you will not find this happiness. And failure will follow you like a shadow. And anger and frustration will be your mates.</p>
<p>这并非你来此的目的。不要为了追求幸福而浪费生命，牺牲你来到此地的更伟大目的，因为你不会找到这份幸福。失败会如影随形。愤怒和沮丧也会成为你的伴侣。</p>
<p>To take the Steps to Knowledge is to begin the journey of return, to begin to come back, to find your way back to what is essential, to what is real. And you will have to make this journey back because having answers or explanations alone will not do.</p>
<p>开展内识进阶，就是开启回归之旅，开始回归，找到回归的本质、回归真实之道的道路。你必须踏上这趟回归之旅，因为仅仅拥有答案或解释是不够的。</p>
<p>You will have to undo what you have created to a certain extent because it has taken you away from yourself, and from this greater purpose that runs like a thread through your life. You cannot change this purpose. How it will be expressed in the world is dependent upon many things, not the least of which are what you recognize to be important and what you pursue in life.</p>
<p>你必须在一定程度上消除你所创造的一切，因为它让你远离了你自己，远离了贯穿你生命的更伟大目的。你无法改变这个目的。它将如何在世界上表达，取决于许多因素，其中最重要的就是你认识到什么是重要的，以及你在生命中追求什么。</p>
<p>So you have a destiny here. It does not mean that everything that happens to you represents fate or that it happens for a purpose. You are the one who has the purpose, not events. You enliven events by the purpose you bring to them, not by what you think is their purpose for you.</p>
<p>因此，你在这里拥有一种天命。它并不意味着发生在你身上的一切都代表着宿命，也不意味着它是为了某个目的而发生。拥有目的的是你，而不是事件。你要通过你的目的来激活事件，而不是你认为它们对你来说意味着什么。</p>
<p>Many people are confused about this. People will say everything that happens in life happens for a purpose. That sounds so edifying. It sounds so spiritual to say that, but it really is not true at all. Everything happens. What is your purpose?</p>
<p>许多人对此感到困惑。人们会说生命中发生的一切都是有目的的。这听起来很有启发性，也很有灵性，但事实并非如此。一切都会发生。你的目的是什么？</p>
<p>Your purpose determines what you value. It determines what you look for within yourself and other people. It determines what you search for and seek for in life. It determines how you evaluate yourself, other people, your circumstances, and the world as a whole.</p>
<p>你的目的决定了你的价值。它决定​​了你在你自己和他人身上寻找什么。它决定了你在生命中追寻和追求什么。它决定了你如何评价你自己、他人、你的处境以及整个世界。</p>
<p>In essence, you only have two choices regarding your purpose. You have the real purpose, which remains to be discovered, experienced and expressed in your life, and then you have all the other substitutes for this. And there is great variety within these substitutes, but essentially they are all attempts to do something else, to be something else, to have something else. So while they look very different from one another, they are really all the same, and they lead to the same kind of suffering and disassociation within yourself.</p>
<p>本质上，关于你的目的，你只有两种选择。你拥有真正的目的，它有待你在你的生命中去发现、体验和表达；然后，你还有所有其他的替代品。这些替代品种类繁多，但本质上，它们都是为了做其他事、成为其他样子、拥有其他东西而做出的尝试。所以，尽管它们看起来彼此迥异，但实际上都是一样的，它们都会导致你内心同样的痛苦和分裂。</p>
<p>People can say, “Oh, well, I’m a soldier” or “I’m an artist” or “I’m a musician” or “I’m a politician” or “I’m a farmer” or “I am a businessperson”, “I am a doctor”, whatever it is. There is a long list. The question yet: “Is this really what you came here to do?” If it is, you are on the right track. If it is not, you are deceiving yourself and giving your life away.</p>
<p>人们可以说：“哦，好吧，我是个士兵”、“我是个艺术家”、“我是个音乐家”、“我是个政客”、“我是个农民”、“我是个商人”、“我是个医生”，等等。诸如此类，不胜枚举。但问题是：“这真的是你来这里的目的吗？”如果是，那你就走在正确的道路上。如果不是，那你只是在自欺欺人，把你的生命拱手让人。</p>
<p>There is no bargaining here with reality. You cannot strike up a deal with Knowledge. “Well, I’ll give a little to you if you’ll give me these things I want.” It does not happen like that. You cannot make a deal. You can either connect with your inner life and learn to follow its directions and take the Steps to Knowledge, or you will attempt to continue your desperate pursuit at personal fulfillment, at trying to make Separation work, at trying to create yourself, all the while missing what has been created within you and for you.</p>
<p>在这里没有现实的讨价还价。你无法与内识达成交易。“好吧，如果你给我我想要的这些东西，我就给你一点。”事情不会这样发生。你无法达成交易。你要么与你的内在生命连接，学习遵循它的指引，并开展内识进阶，要么你将试图继续你对个人成就的绝望追求，试图让分离发挥作用，试图创造你自己，同时却错失了你内在的、为你创造的一切。</p>
<p>This is the big prescription. It is not like taking a pill and feeling better for a few hours. It is not simply adapting yourself to the world in such a way that it upsets you less. That may be necessary, of course, to do those things, but they are temporary. They are only partially successful. You still have the big questions to deal with, the questions you have to live with that you cannot answer.</p>
<p>这是重要的药方。它不像吃一颗药片，几个小时就能感觉好一些。它也不是简单地让你自己适应这个世界，让它不那么让你心烦意乱。当然，这或许是必要的，但它们只是暂时的。它们只是部分有效。你仍然有重大的问题需要处理，那些你无法回答却不得不面对的问题。</p>
<p>For the answer to these questions is choosing a direction in life and living that life and taking that life, step by step. That is the answer. Not proclaiming that you are living your higher purpose or “This is who I really am. This is what I am meant to be.” People do that all the time, and it is just another form of deflection and self-avoidance.</p>
<p>因为这些问题的答案在于选择生命的方向，活出那个方向，一步一步地走下去。这才是答案。而不是宣称你正在活出你更高的宗旨，或者“这就是真正的我。这就是我注定要成为的样子。”人们总是这么做，这只是另一种形式的逃避和自我回避。</p>
<p>When you really connect with the deeper current of your life, it will be very mysterious. You cannot define it. You say, “Well, I know I must do some things” or “I feel I must go to this place” or “I really feel I need to be here doing what I am doing” and you cannot explain it to people. You cannot give it a lofty goal, a lofty definition. You are simply doing what is the next steps for you to do. And you are doing it to the best of your ability.</p>
<p>当你真正连接到你生命更深层次的潮流时，它将非常神秘。你无法定义它。你会说：“嗯，我知道我必须做一些事情”或“我觉得我必须去这个地方”或“我真的觉得我需要在这里做我正在做的事情”，你无法向人们解释它。你无法赋予它一个崇高的目标，一个崇高的定义。你只是在做你接下来要做的事情。而且你在尽你最大的能力去做。</p>
<p>That is it because this is a mystery. The intellect will have to go along and learn to trust this. It is not in control now. You will have to control your outer life and your emotions to a great degree, but you are living a greater life, a life beyond the reach of the intellect.</p>
<p>正因如此，这本身就是一个谜。智力必须顺势而为，并学会信任它。它现在还无法掌控一切。你必须在很大程度上掌控你的外在生命和情绪，但你正在过着一种更伟大的生命，一种超越智力所能触及的生命。</p>
<p>Some people cannot do this. Everything has to be understood. Everything has to be controlled. Everything has to fit into definitions. They are slaves to their minds, to their beliefs, driven fundamentally by insecurity, unable or unwilling to face the mystery and uncertainty of life, unwilling to take risks, unwilling to do anything daring. They live like a colony of gophers. They are just going to dig a hole and live there, pop their head out once in a while, look around, and go back in.</p>
<p>有些人做不到这一点。一切都需要被理解。一切都需要被掌控。一切都需要被定义。他们被他们的心灵和信仰所奴役，内心深处被不安全感所驱使，无法或不愿面对生命的神秘和不确定性，不愿冒险，不愿做任何大胆的事情。他们活得像一群地鼠。他们只会挖个洞住在那里，偶尔探出头来，四处看看，然后又钻回去。</p>
<p>You have the freedom to live a greater life, and you have the freedom to live a lesser life. But if you choose to live a lesser life, do not expect satisfaction. Do not expect harmony within yourself. Do not expect to be in really meaningful relationships with other people. Do not expect your pleasures and your enjoyments to be long lasting, or even more than momentary. Do not think that the acquisition of possessions, wealth, people, power will really satisfy anything within yourself.</p>
<p>你可以自由地过上一种更伟大的生命，你也有自由去过一种更平庸的生命。但如果你选择活得卑微，就不要期待满足。不要期待内心的和谐。不要期待与他人建立真正有意义的关系。不要期待你的快乐和享受能够长久，甚至不仅仅是一时的。不要认为获得财产、财富、人际关系、权力就能真正满足你自己内心的任何需求。</p>
<p>Life will be a desperate, frustrating attempt with moments of pleasure and reprieve here and there. That is what you can expect. If that is fine with you, then you can choose the lesser life, and it will not be quite so disappointing to you.</p>
<p>生命将会是一场令人绝望、令人沮丧的尝试，偶尔也会有快乐和喘息的时刻。这就是你能预料到的。如果你觉得这样可以接受，那么你可以选择较少的生命，这样你就不会那么失望了。</p>
<p>But if you seek real relationships with others, if you seek to find your own strength and ability, if you seek to fulfill your greater destiny here, then you are choosing a very different pathway. And it is this different pathway that holds all the promise of your life.</p>
<p>但如果你寻求与他人的真正关系，如果你寻求发现你自己的力量和能力，如果你寻求成就你在此的更伟大天命，那么你就在选择一条非常不同的道路。正是这条不同的道路承载着你生命的所有承诺。</p>
