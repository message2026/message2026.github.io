<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on March 25, 2011 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2011 年 3 月 25 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great Upheaval is underway in the world, an Upheaval that will manifest itself in many ways—in the growing fragility and difficulty in nations’ economies; the declining resources of the world and the impact that that will have on nations and peoples everywhere; the natural disasters that will increase because humanity has changed the climate of the world; and the loss of food production and arable lands as humanity has squandered its natural inheritance.</p>
<p>世界正在经历大动荡，这场动荡将以多种方式表现出来——各国经济日益的脆弱和困难；世界资源的日益减少，并将对世界各国和各国人民产生影响；由于人类改变了世界气候，自然灾害将会增加；由于人类挥霍了自然遗产，粮食生产和可耕地将减少。</p>
<p>You are at the beginning of the Upheaval, and already you see it manifesting here and there and all around you. If you are paying attention, you will wonder what is happening to the world? Is this a world gone mad? You will feel that the stability of even your nation and the things you took for granted now are being questioned, and you will wonder how strong they really are?</p>
<p>你正处于动荡的开端，你已经看到它在你们周围四处显现。如果你留心观察，你会好奇这个世界正在发生什么？这个世界疯了吗？你会感觉到，甚至你国家的稳定，以及你曾经习以为常的一切，现在都受到了质疑，你会怀疑它们究竟有多强大？</p>
<p>Nations are deeply in debt. They cannot afford to repair the damages, or to help other nations in significant ways. Every nation in the world is facing the Upheaval. There is no nation or tribe that is going to be victorious in the face of it. Everyone will have to face the Upheaval, as it unravels, and its many unforeseen consequences.</p>
<p>各国深陷债务泥潭。它们无力修复损失，也无力为其他国家提供重大援助。世界上每个国家都面临着这场剧变。没有哪个国家或部落能够战胜它。每个人都必须面对这场剧变及其带来的诸多难以预料的后果。</p>
<p>If you are honest with yourself, and not simply projecting blame upon others, or trying to hide in your fantasies or distractions, you will begin to feel the changing world. And you will see perhaps—if your eyes are clear and your mind is still—you will see that you are entering a new kind of world, the new world. And in this new world there will be great disorder.</p>
<p>如果你对你自己诚实，而不是简单地把责任推卸给他人，或者试图躲藏在你的幻想或纷扰之中，你就会开始感受到这个世界的变化。你或许会看到——如果你的眼睛清澈，你的心灵宁静——你会看到你正在进入一个全新的世界，一个新的世界。而在这个新的世界里，将会存在巨大的混乱。</p>
<p>Here you cannot simply project the assumptions of the past. Things are not going to work like they did before. You cannot rest assured that everything will turn out, or that you are in some kind of economic cycle alone, or that prosperity and growth will return. In places it will, temporarily.</p>
<p>你不能简单地套用过去的假设。事情不会像以前那样发展。你不能确信一切都会好转，也不能确信你只是处于某种经济周期之中，也不能确信繁荣和增长会回归。在某些地方，繁荣和增长会暂时回归。</p>
<p>No, you are facing the Upheaval, the consequence of humanity’s misuse and overuse of the world for centuries, and the squandering of resources over war and conflict as if there was no thought of tomorrow, and the blind assumption that technology will solve all of these problems for you, giving you a wonderful, marvelous, miraculous future.</p>
<p>不，你们面临的是剧变，这是人类几个世纪以来对世界的滥用和过度使用的后果，是人类在战争和冲突中浪费资源的后果，仿佛没有明天，是盲目地认为技术会为你们解决所有这些问题，给你们一个美好、奇妙、神奇的未来。</p>
<p>But when technology fails, you can see the impact upon people’s lives, the unforeseen consequences. The more you are dependent upon technology, the more fragile your life will be, and the less aware you will be of your environment and the changing circumstances of your life.</p>
<p>但当科技倒下时，你会看到它对人们生命的影响，以及不可预见的后果。你越依赖科技，你的生命就会越脆弱，你对周围环境和生命变化的感知也会越少。</p>
<p>Technology has become a kind of god now, something that will redeem you and restore you in the face of whatever crisis you might be facing. But when technology itself fails you, you see how dependent you really are, and you see how that affects people everywhere in all directions, so that what happens in one nation is now felt in other nations. If one nation hits economic crisis or catastrophe, it is felt in other nations.</p>
<p>如今，科技已然成为一种神明，无论你面临何种危机，它都能救赎你、让你重获新生。但当科技本身令你失望时，你才会发现你是多么依赖科技，才会看到科技如何影响着四面八方的人们，以至于一个国家发生的事情，如今也会波及到其他国家。如果一个国家遭遇经济危机或灾难，其他国家也会感受到。</p>
<p>God knows this is coming, of course, and that is why there is a New Revelation in the world. For God has spoken again—to warn, to bless and to prepare a struggling and unprepared humanity; to save humanity from its own conflicts and folly, its own blind assumptions and its own critical mistakes. This is a Message for the world, not for one nation or group, or one echelon of society. It is to prepare you for a very unstable world, a changing world, a new world.</p>
<p>当然，上帝知道这将到来，正因如此，世界上才会有一个新启示。因为上帝再次讲话了——为了警告、为了祝福、为了准备一个挣扎且毫无准备的人类；为了拯救人类免于它自身的冲突和愚蠢，它自身的盲目假设和它自身的严重错误。这是一条致世界的讯息，而非致于一个国家或群体，或一个社会阶层。它是为了让你们为一个非常不稳定的世界，一个变化的世界，一个全新的世界进行的准备。</p>
<p>You will feel the Upheaval within your own life as things are challenged or fall away; as you are impacted by changes in your economy, changes in your circumstances, changes in your own experience. As people, places and things fall away from you, you will feel the Upheaval.</p>
<p>当一切面临挑战或消逝，当你受到经济、环境和自身经历变化的影响时，你会感受到你自身生命的剧变。当人、地方和事物离你而去时，你也会感受到剧变。</p>
<p>If you are honest with yourself and are not casting blame all around, you will begin to take stock of your own experience and learn over time how to face it objectively and to learn to see what it is telling you.</p>
<p>如果你对你自己诚实并且不到处责怪他人，你就会开始评估你自身的经历，并随着时间的推移学会如何客观地面对它，并学会看见它正告诉你的事情。</p>
<p>The poor are struggling and are facing even graver circumstances. The rich are embedded in their conflicts, their fantasies and their personal pursuits. They do not see what is coming. In either case, there must be a greater understanding and a greater compassion between the peoples.</p>
<p>穷人正在苦苦挣扎，面临着更严峻的环境​​。富人则沉浸在他们的矛盾、幻想和个人的追求之中。他们看不到即将发生的一切。无论是哪种情况，各国人民之间都必须增进一种更伟大的理解和一种更伟大的同情心。</p>
<p>The Upheaval has the power to undermine human civilization. It is more powerful than your technology. It is more powerful than your incentive, if you do not prepare. If you remain blind and preoccupied and do not see the Great Waves of change that are coming, then they have the power to overtake you.</p>
<p>这场剧变拥有摧毁人类文明的力量。它比你们的科技更强大。如果你们不做好准备，它比你们的动机更强大。如果你们继续盲目执着，看不到即将到来的变革巨浪，那么它们就拥有吞噬你们的力量。</p>
<p>The situation is far more dangerous and grave than people will account for. And if they will stop casting blame and stop running away to their distractions, their hobbies and their concerns, they will begin to see and feel the Great Waves of change moving. This will inform them as to what they must see, know and do.</p>
<p>形势远比人们所能想象的更加危险和严峻。如果他们停止责怪，停止逃避他们的纷扰、他们的爱好和他们的担忧，他们就能开始看到并感受到巨浪的推进。这将告知他们必须看见什么、知道什么并采取的行动。</p>
<p>Humanity is gravely unprepared for the Upheaval. It is gravely unprepared for its encounter with intelligent life in the universe, an encounter that is underway in the world by forces who are here to take advantage of a weak and vulnerable humanity.</p>
<p>人类对这场剧变严重缺乏准备。它对与宇宙智能生命的相遇严重缺乏准备，这场相遇正在世界上进行，而那些势力的目的就是利用孱弱易受伤害的人类。</p>
<p>This is why God has sent a New Revelation into the world. This is why there is a New Message. It must speak to many aspects of your life, and the Teaching must be thorough and complete—far greater than any Message that has ever been sent into this world by the Creator of all the universes.</p>
<p>正因如此，上帝向世界发送了一个新启示。正因如此，一条新讯息才会存在。它必须触及你生命的诸多面向，而且这个教导必须透彻而完整——远超所有宇宙的创造者曾经发送给这个世界的任何讯息。</p>
<p>This Message is to prepare you for the Upheaval, and to prepare you for your encounter with intelligent life in the universe, and to prepare you to bring an end to your ceaseless conflicts and to prepare to protect the world and human civilization.</p>
<p>这个讯息是为了让你们为剧变做好准备，为你们与宇宙智能生命的相遇做好准备，为你们结束无休止的冲突做好准备，为你们保护世界和人类文明做好准备。</p>
<p>To not see and to not prepare is not intelligent, and many people are not acting intelligently today. They are not looking and seeing. They are not putting the pieces of the puzzle together. They are not seeing the connection that what happens in nature will determine the fate and the future of humanity. They do not see that the consequences of your encounter with intelligent life in the universe—as that encounter is taking place at this moment—can affect the outcome for everyone in the world.</p>
<p>视而不见、不做准备是不明智的，而今天许多人的行动并不明智。他们没有观察，没有去看。他们没有把拼图的碎片拼凑起来。他们没有看到自然界发生的事情将决定人类命运和未来的联系。他们没有看到你们与宇宙智能生命相遇的后果——正如这场相遇此刻正在发生的那样——会影响世界上每个人的结局。</p>
<p>People are caught up in religion. They are caught up in politics. They are caught up in social movements. They do not see the bigger picture. They cannot see the larger panorama, and, therefore, they do not recognize the Upheaval and the Great Waves of change that it will produce.</p>
<p>人们陷入宗教。他们陷入政治。他们陷入社会运动。他们看不到更广阔的图景。他们无法看到更广阔的全景，因此，他们没有认出剧变以及它将带来的巨浪般的改变。</p>
<p>What humanity is going through is what countless races in the universe have had to face as they have degraded their own environments and despoiled their natural resources to the point where it threatens their survival and their existence. Countless races have become enamored with power and technology, often introduced by other races who seek to take advantage of their world’s wealth and possibilities.</p>
<p>人类正在经历的，正是宇宙中无数种族曾经面对的。他们破坏了他们自身的环境，掠夺了自然资源，以至于威胁到他们的生存和存在。无数种族沉迷于权力和科技，而这些权力和科技往往是由其他种族引入的，其他种族试图利用他们星球的财富和潜能。</p>
<p>You are following an evolutionary pattern that has been traveled countless times before by countless races in the universe. As nations grow and begin to technologically become more sophisticated and advanced, they begin to outstrip their world’s resources. They begin to overwhelm what their planet can provide and sustain. They believe that technology is wondrous and can solve all of these problems and mitigate all the consequences of the damage that they have done.</p>
<p>你们正在遵循一种进化模式，这种模式此前已被宇宙中无数种族无数次地演绎过。随着国家发展壮大，科技也开始变得更加精进和先进，它们开始超越其世界资源的承载能力。它们开始超越其星球所能提供和维持的极限。他们相信科技是神奇的，能够解决所有这些问题，并减轻它们所造成的所有破坏后果。</p>
<p>So it is not that humanity is exceptionally foolish in this regard. It is simply following a pattern. Not all nations in the universe have followed this pattern. Some have been wiser at the outset and were able to avoid the calamities that so many others had to face.</p>
<p>所以，人类在这方面并非异常愚蠢。它只是遵循一种模式。宇宙中并非所有国家都遵循这种模式。有些国家从一开始就更加明智，从而避免了许多其他国家不得不面对的灾难。</p>
<p>There is Intervention in the world today from races who are here to take advantage of the situation. They are cold and calculating. They see their opportunity. They know that humanity is following this pattern, and that it is entering a period of grave vulnerability and instability. This is a perfect environment to cast persuasion and to establish influence.</p>
<p>当今世界存在着来自某些种族的干预，他们来此是为了利用这一局势。他们冷酷而精于算计。他们看到了他们的机会。他们知道人类正在遵循这种模式，并且正在进入一个极其脆弱和不稳定的时期。这是一个进行说服和建立影响力的完美环境。</p>
<p>As people in the world lose faith in their governments and institutions, they will turn to other powers in the universe to guide them and to save them. It is the ideal environment for Intervention. It is part of the great Upheaval that people do not see.</p>
<p>当世界上的人们对他们的政府和机构失去信心时，他们将转向宇宙中的其他大国来指引他们、拯救他们。这是干预的理想环境。这是人们看不见剧变的一部分。</p>
<p>Even the wisest of the leaders, who see many aspects of the Upheaval, cannot really communicate what they see to their populations. They have to sustain the stability of their country today and tomorrow and meet all the immediate problems that are arising. They do not have the time or the consensus of support to really prepare for the big things in the future, the big changes that will come to their countries.</p>
<p>即使是最明智的领导人，即使他们洞察了剧变的方方面面，也无法真正将他们所看到的传达给民众。他们必须维护国家当前和未来的稳定，并应对所有正在出现的紧迫问题。他们没有时间，也没有共识，无法真正为未来的重大事件、即将降临国家的巨大变革做好准备。</p>
<p>What happens when they run out of fuel? What happens when water resources diminish significantly? What happens when other nations begin to abandon them, pulling away all of their investments?</p>
<p>如果燃料耗尽，会发生什么？如果水资源大幅减少，会发生什么？如果其他国家开始放弃这些项目，撤走所有投资，会发生什么？</p>
<p>These are the things you prepare for, for the future, for the Upheaval itself. But what leader in the world can do this and still meet the problems of the day, and the complicated networks of support and administration?</p>
<p>这些都是你们为未来、为剧变本身所准备的。但世界上哪位领导人能够做到这一点，同时还能应对当下的种种问题，以及错综复杂的支持和行政网络？</p>
<p>God knows this, and there is no blame. It is humanity acting out its long-established beliefs and assumptions, and following the weakness of its emphasis on living for the moment and not preparing adequately for the future.</p>
<p>上帝知道这一点，对此无可指责。它是人类在践行其根深蒂固的信念和假设，并遵循其只顾眼前而未充分为未来做准备的弱点。</p>
<p>At this time, humanity is sacrificing the future of its children. The world that they will have to face will be so much more arduous and difficult. Even if they have more advanced technology, where will be the energy to support it and to generate it? Where will their food come from? Will they have clean waters to drink as the nations become more arid and as populations become unstable?</p>
<p>此时此刻，人类正在牺牲子孙后代的未来。他们将要面对的世界将更加艰辛和艰难。即使他们拥有更先进的技术，又从哪里获得能源来支持和创造这些技术呢？他们的食物从何而来？随着各国日益干旱，人口日益不稳定，他们还能喝上干净的水吗？</p>
<p>To seek more growth at this time is to spend the future of humanity. But growth will be sought to meet the demands of today and the needs of the people in this moment and in the days to come.</p>
<p>此时寻求更多增长，就等于牺牲人类的未来。但增长的追求，不仅要满足当今的需求，还要满足人们此刻及未来的需求。</p>
<p>War and conflict will only squander the precious resources. Do not think that cities can be rebuilt and nations restored if they are devastated, for no one will have the resources to really do this. War and conflict, for whatever purpose, will only serve to hasten your demise.</p>
<p>战争和冲突只会浪费宝贵的资源。不要认为城市被毁后还能重建，国家被毁后还能复兴，因为没有人拥有真正做到这一点的资源。战争和冲突，无论出于何种目的，都只会加速你们的灭亡。</p>
<p>Even if conflicts are generated to support freedom, there will be a great cost, not only in this moment but in the future of that nation. This is not to say that freedom movements should not occur, but there must be a reckoning of the greater costs by all who are involved.</p>
<p>即使为了维护自由而引发冲突，也必然会付出巨大的代价，不仅在当下，而且在国家的未来。这并不是说自由运动不应该发生，而是所有参与者都必须考虑到更大的代价。</p>
<p>If leaders realized this, and their populations were dissatisfied, they would step aside. They would relinquish the reins of control. For the future of their nation is at stake—not just for today and tomorrow but for the years and decades to come.</p>
<p>如果领导人意识到这一点，而民众又不满意，他们就会下台。他们会放弃控制权。因为他们国家的未来岌岌可危——不仅是今天和明天，更是未来数年乃至数十年。</p>
<p>A hundred years from now, many nations in the world will not even exist. People will not even be able to live in them. There will not be enough food production, not enough water, not enough fuel to sustain a large population.</p>
<p>一百年后，世界上许多国家将不复存在。人们甚至无法在这些国家生存。粮食产量、水资源和燃料都不足以养活如此庞大的人口。</p>
<p>Between now and then, the great Upheaval will occur and is beginning to occur now. You cannot stop it. You can only mitigate it and prepare for it. You can prevent some of its graver consequences, but you cannot stop it entirely.</p>
<p>从现在到那时，大动荡将会发生，而且现在已经开始发生。你无法阻止它。你只能减轻它的影响并为之做好准备。你可以预防一些更严重的后果，但你无法完全阻止它。</p>
<p>Now is not [the time] to say, “What do I want out of life?” It is more appropriate to say, “What must I do?” That is the question. And that is the question that you must keep asking as every new situation emerges, as every unforeseen change occurs, as every new opportunity seems to arise—whether that opportunity be genuine or not.</p>
<p>现在不是问“我想要从生命中得到什么”的时候。更合适的问是“我必须做什么？”。这才是问题所在。当每一个新情况出现，当每一个不可预见的变化发生，当每一个新机会似乎出现——无论这个机会是否真实——时，你必须不断问这个问题。</p>
<p>You cannot be satisfied and rest on your assumptions. You cannot think your nation will survive anything and everything. You cannot think your economy is immutable. You cannot think that your leaders will know what to do in the face of growing crises occurring in many places all at once.</p>
<p>你不能满足于你的假设。你不能认为你的国家能够安然度过一切。你不能认为你的经济是不可改变的。你不能认为你的领导人能够知道在多地同时发生的日益严重的危机中该如何应对。</p>
<p>You can either panic and be afraid and try to go run and hide somewhere—which would be a grave and probably fatal mistake—or you can begin to gain access to the deeper Intelligence within you that God has put there to guide you, to protect you and to bless you in the face of the Upheaval.</p>
<p>你可以惊慌失措、害怕不已，试图逃跑、躲藏在某个地方——这将是一个严重的、甚至可能是致命的错误——或者你可以开始接触上帝放置在你内心深处的智能，上帝把它放置在你的内心深处，在动荡中指引你、保护你、祝福你。</p>
<p>You were sent into the world to live in the world at these great and momentous times. God has given you the clarity and the strength and the wisdom, but this exists beyond the realm and the reach of your intellect and stands apart from your social conditioning and your consensus beliefs, attitudes and assumptions.</p>
<p>你被派到这个世界，生活在这些伟大而重要的时间。上帝赋予你清晰性、实力和智慧，但这超越了你的智力所能及的范围，并且与你的社会熏陶以及你的共识信仰、态度和假设截然不同。</p>
<p>God has given you the power, but you must take the Steps to Knowledge to find it, to understand it and to discern what it means and how it is to be used appropriately in life. You cannot seize Knowledge and use it to increase your wealth, or to overtake other people or to establish your priorities. Knowledge is not a tool of the intellect. It is more powerful than the intellect.</p>
<p>上帝赋予了你力量，但你必须开展内识进阶去发现它，理解它，辨识它的意义以及如何在生命中恰当地运用它。你无法抓住内识并利用它来增加你的财富，或超越他人，或确立你的优先次序。内识并非智力的工具。它比智力更强大。</p>
<p>Wishing and praying and hiding will not help you, for the world is giving you signs as to what is coming, and to what you must see know and do, and the degree to which you must change your life and circumstances to find higher ground, to secure your own position so that you will have the ability and opportunity to help others.</p>
<p>希望、祈祷和躲藏都无法帮助你，因为世界正在向你发出迹象，告诉你即将发生的事情，你必须看见、知道并采取行动，你必须在多大程度上改变你的生命和境遇，以找到更高的境界，确保你自身的位置，这样你就有能力和机会去帮助他人。</p>
<p>For the human need will grow beyond what you have ever seen before, and the degree of service that must be rendered will be far greater than anything the human family has ever had to deal with on a large scale. The time of giving is just beginning.</p>
<p>因为人类的需求将远超以往任何时候，而需要提供的服务规模也将远远超过人类家庭以往所经历的任何大规模服务。给予的时间才刚刚开始。</p>
<p>The need will be so great that you will feel it is impossible to meet. But that does not mean that you must not do what you were sent here to do. And only Knowledge within you knows what that is—where you must go, whom you must meet, what you must undertake in your life and what you must release and set aside.</p>
<p>这种需求将如此伟大，以至于你会觉得不可能满足。但这并不意味着你不能去做你被派来此要做的事情。只有你内在的内识知道那是什么——你必须去往何方，你必须遇见谁，你必须在你的生命中承担什么，以及你必须释放和搁置什么。</p>
<p>To see the Upheaval out on the horizon is to give you time to prepare. If you wait until it is at your doorstep, it will be too late. There is very little you can do.</p>
<p>看见即将来临的剧变，就是给你时间做好准备。如果你等到它真的来到你家门口，那就太晚了。你所能做的已经所剩无几了。</p>
<p>It is like a great series of waves. If you see them coming, if you see the ocean withdrawing, and you realize that this is not natural, this is not right, something is amiss, then you have time—perhaps only a little bit of time—to move to higher ground, to escape your vulnerable and unsustainable position.</p>
<p>它就像一连串的巨浪。如果你看到它们涌来，如果你看到大海正在退却，并且意识到这不自然，这不对劲，有什么地方不对劲，那么你就有时间——或许只有一点点时间——去往更高的地方，去摆脱你脆弱且难以为继的处境。</p>
<p>It is a time to reconsider your work and your profession—will this all be able to survive the Great Waves of change? Where you live, can you function without the use of an automobile? Can you find your nearest resources easily? Or are you living in some distant place, on the top of a mountain, or way out in the country in a very vulnerable position? These are all the things that you must now reconsider in the face of the Upheaval.</p>
<p>是时候重新审视你的工作和职业了——这一切能否在巨变的浪潮中幸存下来？在你居住的地方，你能在不使用汽车的情况下正常生活吗？你能轻易找到最近的资源吗？还是你住在某个遥远的地方，在山顶上，或者在遥远的乡村，处于非常脆弱的境地？面对剧变，这些都是你必须重新思考的问题。</p>
<p>The New Message is revealing what is coming and the great challenge to human civilization—the challenge of the danger of collapse within, and the danger of competition from without. It is painting a very clear picture. It is not the end of humanity. It is not the end days. That is foolishness. But it is the end of many things. It is the end of many assumptions and beliefs. It is the end of the world as you have known it and have come to assume it to be.</p>
<p>新讯息正在揭示即将发生的事情以及对人类文明的伟大挑战——内在崩溃的危险，以及来自外部竞争的危险。它描绘了一幅非常清晰的画面。它不是人类的终结。它不是末日。那是愚蠢的。但它是许多事物的终结。它是许多假设和信仰的终结。它是你们所认知的、并逐渐假设的世界的终结。</p>
<p>In that sense, it is the end times—a time of great change, a threshold, a time where human unity and cooperation will determine whether humanity is able to regain a greater strength and a greater resilience, or whether it begins to decline in all directions, sinking into an abyss of war and deprivation.</p>
<p>从这个意义上说，它是一个末日——一个伟大变革的时代，一个门槛，一个人类团结与合作将决定人类是否能够重新获得更伟大的力量和一种更伟大的韧性，还是开始全面衰落，陷入战争和贫困的深渊的时代。</p>
<p>Only such a great turning point in the evolution of humanity could bring a New Revelation into the world, a New Revelation that is here to empower the individual, to restore your native and natural abilities, to warn you of the Upheaval and the Great Waves of change and to prepare you for your encounter with a universe that is full of intelligent life—a non-human universe, a universe that you know nothing about.</p>
<p>唯有人类进化中这样一个伟大的转折点，才能将一个新启示带入世界，这个新启示在此赋权个体，重建你天生的和自然的能力，警示你剧变和变革的巨浪，并让你进行准备去迎接一个充满智能生命的宇宙——一个非人类的宇宙，一个你一无所知的宇宙。</p>
<p>Do not shrink from this, or you shrink from you own higher purpose and calling to be in the world. Do not run away and hide—hiding behind your assumptions, your beliefs or your admonitions of others—for this will not enable you to prepare, to become strong and to be of assistance to people around you.</p>
<p>不要逃避这一点，否则你就逃避了你自身身处世界的更高宗旨和召唤。不要逃避和躲藏——躲在你的假设、你的信仰或你对他人的劝诫背后——因为这无助于你进行准备，无助于你变得强大，无助于你周围的人。</p>
<p>It is always a choice between strength and weakness, between Knowledge and everything that parades or pretends to be Knowledge. What you decide today, what you choose to pay attention to, where you place your focus has every importance as to what you will see and your ability to recognize the changing circumstances of the world and your ability to prepare for the Upheaval.</p>
<p>它始终是在力量与弱点之间、在内识与一切炫耀或伪装成内识的事物之间做出的选择。你今天做出的决定，你选择关注什么，你的焦点放在哪里，都至关重要，这关系到你将看到什么，你认知世界变化境况的能力，以及你为剧变做好准备的能力。</p>
<p>You must find the courage and the strength and the determination to do this. And where you will find this is in the power and presence of Knowledge living deep within you. For Knowledge is not afraid of the world. Knowledge does not condemn the world. Knowledge is not shocked and dismayed by the world and the tragedies of humanity, the foolishness of humanity, the blindness of humanity.</p>
<p>你必须找到勇气、力量和决心来做到这一点。而你将在生活在你内在深处的内识的力量和存在中找到它。因为内识不惧怕世界。内识不谴责世界。内识不会因世界以及人类的悲剧、人类的愚蠢、人类的盲目而感到震惊和沮丧。</p>
<p>Knowledge is compassionate towards all these things. It understands that without Knowledge, people will make mistakes and will be prone to make mistakes, for they do not have the center of their own certainty and integrity to guide them.</p>
<p>内识对所有这些事情都充满同情心。它理解，没有内识，人们就会犯错，而且很容易犯错，因为他们没有他们自身的确定性和完整性的中心来指引他们。</p>
<p>This is why there is no Hell and punishment because God knows until you recover that part of yourself that is connected to God—which is Knowledge—all you could do is make mistakes and try to learn from your errors. It is a very destructive and painful way of learning, of course, but for many people it is the path that they choose, persistently.</p>
<p>这就是为什么没有地狱和惩罚，因为上帝知道，除非你恢复你内在与上帝相连的那一部分——也就是内识——否则你所能做的只有犯错，并努力从错误中学习。当然，这是一种极具破坏性和痛苦的学习方式，但对许多人来说，这是他们坚持不懈地选择的道路。</p>
<p>Humanity does not have much time to prepare. You cannot debate and contemplate this for years. Everything is in motion.</p>
<p>人类没有太多时间进行准备。你不可能花数年时间去争论和思考这个问题。一切都在进行中。</p>
<p>You have changed the chemistry of your own environment. Your soils are dead and depleted from the use of harsh chemicals. There is an ever-growing number of people in the world drinking from a slowly shrinking well. The vulnerabilities of humanity’s networks of trade and commerce are becoming exposed. Many assumptions and beliefs will have to be set aside to face this new world and to navigate it successfully.</p>
<p>你们改变了你们自身环境的化学性质。由于使用刺激性化学物质，你们的土壤已经枯竭，死亡殆尽。世界上越来越多的人饮用着一口逐渐萎缩的井水。人类的贸易和商业网络的脆弱性正在暴露无遗。为了面对这个新世界并成功驾驭它，许多假设和信念必须被抛诸脑后。</p>
<p>God has given you the power to navigate the new world, and to respond to it wisely and compassionately, and to avoid the hazards of living in a panic or becoming a victim of the great change that is upon you.</p>
<p>上帝赋予了你们力量去探索新世界，并明智而富有同情心地应对它，避免陷入恐慌或成为即将发生的伟大变革的受害者。</p>
<p>The religions of the world cannot prepare you for the Upheaval. They may warn of great change. They may prophesize great change. But they cannot discern what it really means, and they do not have the wisdom and the [New] Revelation to prepare people sufficiently in the time that you have.</p>
<p>世界上的宗教无法让你们为剧变做好准备。它们或许会警告巨变。它们或许会预言巨变。但是它们无法辨识这真正意味着什么，它们没有智慧和[新]启示，在你们拥有的时间里让人们充分准备。</p>
<p>That is why God has spoken again. That is why there is a great Revelation in the world. It has taken the Messenger [over] twenty-five years to receive it, it is so thorough and so great and comprehensive. It is the largest Message ever given to humanity, for you are now speaking to a literate world with modern communications, where information can go all around the world in seconds—situations and conditions that never existed before.</p>
<p>正因为如此，上帝再次讲话了。正因为如此，一个伟大的启示存在于这个世界。信使花了二十五年多的时间才接收到它，它如此透彻，如此伟大，如此包罗万象。它是人类有史以来被赋予的最宏大讯息，因为上帝现在正在对一个拥有现代通讯的文明世界讲话，在这个世界里，信息可以在几秒钟内传遍世界各地——这是以前从未有过的情况和条件。</p>
<p>Therefore, receive the Revelation. You do not know yet for sure if it is the New Message from God because you have not explored it sufficiently. But do not reject it. Do not deny it, or you deny that which can guarantee and assure your safety and your ability beyond that to be of greater service to humanity in a world of radical change and upheaval.</p>
<p>因此，接收启示吧。你还无法确定它是否是来自上帝的新讯息，因为你尚未充分探索它。但不要拒绝它。不要否认它，否则你就否认了能够保证和确保你安全的内识，从而在一个剧烈变革和动荡的世界中为人类提供更伟大服务的内识。</p>
<p>The Upheaval is occurring. It is stirring peoples around the world. It is stirring the desire for freedom. It is promoting protest and even revolution. It is challenging the stability of nations. It is affecting the price and availability of food. It is determining how nations will respond to a world of shrinking resources, and physical and social upheaval.</p>
<p>剧变正在发生。它正在激励世界各地的人民。它正在激发人们对自由的渴望。它正在引发抗议甚至革命。它正在挑战各国的稳定。它正在影响粮食的价格和供应。它正在决定各国将如何应对一个资源日益萎缩、物质和社会动荡的世界。</p>
<p>This is a time to grow up and to become wise and responsible. It is a time to outgrow your fantasies and your obsessive pursuits. It is a time to pay attention, to still your mind, to quiet your mind so that you may see, hear and know.</p>
<p>这是一个成长、变得明智和负责任的时刻。它是一个超越幻想和执着追求的时刻。它是一个关注、静止你的心灵、静下心来的时刻，这样你才能看见、听见、知道。</p>
<p>It is time to take the Steps to Knowledge—whether you are Christian, Muslim, or Buddhist, a Hindu or of any other faith tradition. It is a time to allow God to guide you through the power and presence of Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>是时候开展内识进阶了——无论你是基督徒、穆斯林、佛教徒、印度教徒还是任何其他信仰传统。是时候允许上帝通过你内在内识的力量和存在来指引你了。</p>
<p>The leaders will be confused. They will be overwhelmed. Even if they have an understanding of the dangers ahead, they will be overwhelmed by the needs of the day and the circumstances they face at this moment. They do not have the support of their peoples to instigate radical change in how their nations function, or in establishing a new direction for their economies. They have to keep everything going as it is already, or they face social upheaval; they face resistance and denial and a loss of support.</p>
<p>领导人将会感到困惑，不知所措。即使他们理解未来的危险，他们也会被眼前的现实需求和环境所压倒。他们缺乏民众的支持，无法推动国家运作方式的根本性改变，也无法为经济确立新的方向。他们必须维持现状，否则将面临社会动荡；他们将面临阻力、否定和失去支持。</p>
<p>They are in a conundrum, you see. To sustain stability today, they sacrifice their ability to prepare for tomorrow. You would do no better if you were the leader.</p>
<p>你看，他们正陷入困境。为了维持今天的稳定，他们牺牲了为明天做准备的能力。就算你是领导者，你也不会做得更好。</p>
<p>Even the freest nations will be under great pressure as their resources decline, as their options diminish, as their peoples become more desperate and more demanding and more contentious.</p>
<p>即使是最自由的国家也将面临巨大的压力，因为它们的资源减少，它们的选择减少，它们的人民变得更加绝望、更加苛刻、更加好斗。</p>
<p>If you understood the Upheaval and the Great Waves of change, you would see why and how this will all emerge. You could not predict the day and the moment of events, but you could see the patterns. You could see the consequences. You could see the great difficulties this will produce and the fact that humanity does not have answers for many of these things. It will be overwhelmed by the scale and the scope of environmental and social problems.</p>
<p>如果你理解了这场剧变和变革的巨浪，你就能看到这一切为何以及如何发生。你无法预测事件发生的日期和时刻，但你能看到其模式。你能看到其后果。你能看到这将带来的巨大困难，以及人类对其中许多问题尚无答案的事实。它将被环境和社会问题的规模和范围所淹没。</p>
<p>Even the wealthy nations will be struggling to survive and to maintain stability. Where will their wealth come from if their resources are diminished? They cannot borrow from one another forever, and that will all break down in the future anyway.</p>
<p>即使是富裕国家也将挣扎求生，难以维持稳定。如果资源枯竭，他们的财富从何而来？他们不可能永远相互借贷，而且这种借贷模式在未来终将崩溃。</p>
<p>Many debts will not be paid. Nations will fall out of favor with each other. They will have to choose whether they will cooperate to face the Upheaval, or whether they will compete for the remaining resources.</p>
<p>许多债务将无力偿还。各国将彼此失宠。他们必须做出选择：是合作应对动乱，还是争夺剩余的资源。</p>
<p>The consequences of competition now are so grave and catastrophic that you cannot even imagine it. Even the normal tendencies of humanity will have to be arrested if peoples and nations are to survive and build a greater strength in the face of the Upheaval.</p>
<p>如今竞争的后果如此严重，如此灾难性，你甚至无法想象。如果各国人民和国家想要在动荡中生存下来，并增强实力，就连人类的正常倾向也必须被遏制。</p>
<p>You must listen more deeply within yourself to hear the truth of Our words. Do not contend with it based on your ideas or beliefs, or you will miss the wisdom and the power of what We are saying and revealing to you.</p>
<p>你必须更深入地聆听你自己的内心，才能听见我们话语的真理。不要基于你的想法或信仰与之抗争，否则你将错失我们向你宣讲和启示的智慧和力量。</p>
<p>Be humble and admit you do not know what is coming. Be humble and honest and admit you do not know how to prepare or what is emerging on the horizon. It is all about self-honesty, you see, not about how correct you think your ideas are, or how much you have invested in your position in life—your ideology, your beliefs, your convictions. Everything will have to be reconsidered now in the face of a new world.</p>
<p>谦逊地承认你不知道会发生什么。谦逊而诚实地承认你不知道如何准备，也不知道地平线上会出现什么。你看，这完全关乎自我诚实，而不是你认为你的想法有多正确，或者说，你对你的生命定位——你的意识形态、你的信仰、你的信念——投入了多少。面对一个新世界，现在一切都必须重新考虑。</p>
<p>The Upheaval can redeem you. It can strengthen you. It can bring your life in order. It can establish authentic and meaningful priorities for you. It can end your self-destructive behavior because you will have so many important things to do and to consider. It will clarify your relationships. It will clarify what must be done. It will reveal to you what you can do today, and tomorrow, and the days to come. It can help you reorganize your life and move to a safer and more secure position in your community.</p>
<p>剧变可以救赎你，可以增强你的力量，可以让你的生命井然有序，可以为你建立真实而有意义的优先事项，可以终结你的自我毁灭行为，因为你将有如此多的重要事情要做、要考虑。它可以理清你的人际关系，可以明确哪些事情必须做。它可以揭示你今天、明天以及未来的日子里可以做什么。它可以帮助你重建生命，在你的社区中寻求更安全、更有保障的位置。</p>
<p>Do not live near moving waters. Do not live near the seashore. Do not live near rivers. Do not live near earthquake zones—unless God has called you to be in those places to be of service to others.</p>
<p>不要住在流水附近。不要住在海边。不要住在河流附近。不要住在地震带附近——除非上帝呼唤你到那些地方去服务他人。</p>
<p>If you do not heed this, then nothing will save you. You have put your life in danger blindly, foolishly. Do not think you will be saved in the last moment by some miracle. It will be mere chance whether you can survive, but the odds will be against you.</p>
<p>如果你不听从这一点，那么什么也救不了你。你盲目、愚蠢地将你的生命置于危险之中。不要指望最后一刻会有奇迹拯救你。你能不能活下来只是个偶然，胜算对你来说很小。</p>
<p>God has already provided the warning—clearly, repetitively, said in different ways, cast in different ideas, but clearly. Neglect this and you have no right to ask for a miracle in the face of catastrophe.</p>
<p>上帝早已发出警告——清晰地、反复地，以不同的方式、不同的想法传达，但始终清晰。忽视这一点，你就没有权利在灾难面前祈求奇迹。</p>
<p>The Creator of the universes will not save humanity in the end. And those races who are here to intervene will promise humanity wealth and power and equanimity, but it is all a deception, you see. They come not with military power but the powers of persuasion that are more developed and refined than what humanity casts upon itself. They are opportunists. They will say anything and do anything to convince you that they, more than you, understand the needs of the human family and how these needs can be fulfilled. But it is all a deception—clever, time-consuming, but in the end the world could be overtaken without firing a shot.</p>
<p>宇宙的创造者最终不会拯救人类。那些来此干预的种族将承诺人类财富、权力和平静，但你看，这全都是骗局。他们带来的不是军事力量，而是比人类施加于它自身之上的更发达、更精炼的说服力。他们是机会主义者。他们会说任何话、做任何事来说服你们，让他们相信，他们比你们更理解人类大家庭的需求，以及这些需求如何得到满足。但这全都是骗局——聪明、耗时，但最终世界可能不费一枪一弹就被征服。</p>
<p>As humanity’s condition deteriorates, as greater instability emerges, as the weakness of nations becomes more apparent, people will be frightened and uncertain and distrustful. This puts them in a position to be easily influenced by foreign, clever and cunning powers.</p>
<p>随着人类境况的恶化，随着更大的不稳定性出现，随着国家弱点的日益凸显，人们将感到恐惧、不安和不信任。这使得他们很容易受到外国狡猾势力的影响。</p>
<p>This is all part of the Upheaval, you see. The consequences had to come eventually. You cannot plunder the world forever. You cannot add more people to the world forever. You cannot deplete the topsoil of the world forever. You cannot sully and pollute the streams and waters of the world forever. You cannot change the chemistry of the environment forever without facing a tremendous set of consequences.</p>
<p>你看，这都是剧变的一部分。后果终究会降临。你们不可能永远掠夺世界。你们不可能永远给世界增添人口。你们不可能永远耗尽世界表层土壤。你们不可能永远玷污和污染世界的河流和水域。你们不可能永远改变环境的化学性质，否则将面临一系列巨大的后果。</p>
<p>Nations are investing now more heavily in their military establishments, afraid, with increasing anxiety over the insecurity and lack of protection for their nations. But you cannot use these weapons in the future, for they will destroy the essential resources. You cannot use them without committing genocide. You cannot destroy cities, for you will not have the resources to rebuild them.</p>
<p>各国如今正加大对军事设施的投资，对国家不安全和缺乏保护的担忧与日俱增。但未来不能使用这些武器，因为它们会摧毁必要的资源。使用它们必然会造成种族灭绝。不能摧毁城市，因为将没有资源重建它们。</p>
<p>It is a fool’s pursuit. It is expedient in the moment. It is all for the moment. It is living for the moment, but it has no wisdom for the future.</p>
<p>它是愚昧人的追求。它只是一时的权宜之计。一切都是为了眼前。它只顾眼前而活，却缺乏对未来的智慧。</p>
<p>It is not what the world needs. It is not what will save humanity. It is not even what will save your nation and your community.</p>
<p>它不是世界所需要的。它无法拯救人类。它甚至无法拯救你们的国家和你们的社区。</p>
<p>Another world war would really be the end. You cannot even afford regional wars without great cost, not only in the moment, of human suffering, deprivation, death. But what will it mean for the future of the nation?</p>
<p>再发生一场世界大战就真的意味着世界末日了。即使是局部战争，也需要付出巨大的代价，不仅仅是眼前的痛苦、匮乏和死亡。但这对国家的未来意味着什么？</p>
<p>Nations are not preparing for the Great Waves of change. They are not preparing for the Upheaval. They think life is just going to go on as it always has been—perhaps with greater difficulties here and there, but they do not see the great change that has already occurred in the world. They do not see that they are entering and have entered a new world. They do not see the Upheaval.</p>
<p>各国并未为变革的巨浪进行准备。他们并未为剧变进行准备。他们认为生命将一如既往地继续下去——或许这里那里会遭遇更大的困难，但他们没有看到世界上已经发生的巨变。他们没有看到他们正在进入并且已经进入了一个新世界。他们没有看到剧变。</p>
<p>They are not educating their peoples. They are not preparing their citizens. They are not strengthening those things that are essential. Their wealth has been lost. They are living in debt.</p>
<p>他们没有教育他们的人民，没有培养他们的公民，没有加强那些至关重要的事情。他们的财富已经流失，他们生活在债务之中。</p>
<p>What will you have to sell to the world if it cannot buy anything? Where will your stability and strength come from? These are the difficult questions that nations and leaders must face, but they are also questions for you to consider.</p>
<p>如果世界什么都买不到，你们还能卖什么给它？你们的稳定和力量从何而来？这些都是国家和领导人必须面对的难题，但也是你应该思考的问题。</p>
<p>You do not have answers. No one really has answers for all of this, answers for the Upheaval and the Great Waves of change. For this, you need the power and the presence of Knowledge to guide you. For this, you need a Revelation from the Creator of all life. You need God to help you. You need a greater wisdom. You need a greater strength. You need a greater determination that must come from a much more powerful part of yourself, which you are barely aware of.</p>
<p>你没有答案。没有人真正拥有这一切的答案，没有关于剧变和巨浪的答案。为此，你需要内识的力量和存在来指引你。为此，你需要来自所有生命创造者的一个启示。你需要上帝来帮助你。你需要一种更伟大的智慧。你需要一种更伟大的力量。你需要一种更伟大的决心，这必须来自你自己的一个更强大部分，而你几乎没有察觉到它。</p>
<p>It is not about what you want. It is what you must do. This will give you strength, courage and confidence if you can respond to this consistently and repeatedly.</p>
<p>它不是你想要什么的问题，而是你必须做什么的问题。如果你能持续不断地回应，这将赋予你力量、勇气和信心。</p>
<p>This is the warning and the blessing, but it is also a preparation. God has provided the Steps to Knowledge. God has provided the wisdom from the universe that can instruct you on how to face, comprehend and navigate a world undergoing Upheaval.</p>
<p>这是警告和祝福，但这也是一种准备。上帝提供了内识进阶。上帝提供了来自宇宙的智慧，能够指导你如何面对、理解和驾驭一个正在经历剧变的世界。</p>
<p>People have native skills that have become dormant from lack of use that can alert them to the presence of danger and to prepare them for the future with a greater wisdom and certainty. All these native skills are connected to Knowledge, you see.</p>
<p>人们拥有一些与生俱来的技能，由于缺乏运用而处于休眠状态，这些技能能够警示他们危险的存在，并以更伟大的智慧和确定性为未来做好准备。所有这些与生俱来的技能都与内识相连，你看。</p>
<p>For Knowledge to guide you, it must keep you alive. For Knowledge to fulfill itself through you so that you may give your true gifts to the world, it must protect you from destruction.</p>
<p>为了让内识指引你，它必须让你活下去。为了让内识通过你实现它自身，以便你能够将你真正的礼物给予世界，它必须保护你免遭毁灭。</p>
<p>That is why it is the great protector and sustainer. It is the redeemer. But it resides beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect, so you must go beyond your mind to hear it, to discern it and to respond to it. This is what it means to take the Steps to Knowledge.</p>
<p>正因如此，它是伟大的保护者和维系者。它是救赎者。但它超越智力的领域和范围，所以你必须超越你的心灵才能聆听它、辨识它并回应它。这就是开展内识进阶的意义。</p>
<p>Do not think or pretend that you can do this sufficiently today, for you are only a beginner. No matter how intuitive you think you are, you are still a beginner, for you do not yet understand what is coming to the world and what is here already. Your skills and your strengths are not yet sufficient to face these things and are barely adequate even to deal with the normal circumstances of your life.</p>
<p>不要认为或假装你今天就能充分做到这一点，因为你只是一名初学者。无论你认为你多么有直觉，你依然是一名初学者，因为你还不理解什么即将降临世界，什么已经存在。你的技能和你的力量还不足以面对这些，甚至勉强足以应对你生命中的日常处境。</p>
<p>To save humanity, you must prepare humanity. To assure the future and the stability of human civilization, you must prepare for the Upheaval and the Great Waves of change that it will produce.</p>
<p>要拯救人类，你必须让人类做好准备。为了确保人类文明的未来和稳定，你必须为剧变和它将产生的变革巨浪做好准备。</p>
<p>Do this, and you will serve the world as you were intended to serve the world. Do this, and your life will make sense, and you will no longer be in serious conflict with yourself. Do this, and your mind will change, and your heart will change, and your priorities will change—as they should.</p>
<p>这样做，你就能以你本该服务世界的方式服务世界。这样做，你的生命就会有意义，你就不会再与你自己产生严重的冲突。这样做，你的心灵就会改变，你的内心就会改变，你的优先事项也会改变——正如它们理所当然的那样。</p>
<p>Let this be your understanding.</p>
<p>让这成为你的理解。</p>
