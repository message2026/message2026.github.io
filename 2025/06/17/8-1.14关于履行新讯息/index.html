<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on August 24, 2007 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2007 年 8 月 24 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every person that has come into the world has come for a greater purpose, on a mission sent from God. This purpose and mission are kept sacred within a deeper Intelligence within each person, an Intelligence called Knowledge.</p>
<p>每个人来到这个世界，都是为了一个更伟大的目的，肩负着上帝赋予的使命。这个目的和使命被神圣地珍藏在每个人内心深处的智能之中，这个智能被称为内识。</p>
<p>Personal intellect, which has been conditioned and shaped by your experience in the world, cannot gain access to this mission and purpose, for it is held sacred and inviolable within you. It must be called out of you by forces from beyond yourself, by circumstances in the world, by key and important relationships.</p>
<p>个人的智力，它已经被你在世间的经历所制约和塑造，无法触及这个使命和目的，因为它在你内在被视为神圣且不可侵犯。它必须被你自身之外的力量、被世间的情境、被关键且重要的关系从你内在召唤出来。</p>
<p>For the calling here is to serve the world, not merely to enlighten yourself, not merely to put yourself in a position of extreme happiness and contentment.</p>
<p>因为召唤在这里是服务世界，而不仅仅是启迪你自己，不仅仅是让你自己处于极度幸福和满足的位置。</p>
<p>Therefore, the activating force must come from beyond you. It must be called out of you. This purpose and this mission must be called out of you.</p>
<p>因此，这股驱动力必须来自你之外。它必须从你身上被唤起。这个目的和这个使命必须从你身上被唤起。</p>
<p>The very circumstances that many people want to avoid and to deny, circumstances they do not want to face and contend with, are the very circumstances that have the power to call their greater purpose and mission out of them.</p>
<p>许多人想要避免和否认的情况、他们不想面对和应对的情况，恰恰是有能力唤起他们更伟大目的和使命的情况。</p>
<p>Therefore, the answer is within you, but the calling is not. It is out in the world, calling for you.</p>
<p>因此，答案就在你心中，但召唤却不在你的内在。它在外面的世界，正在召唤你。</p>
<p>It must be understood that your role and position in the world is not simply to garner a future reward. If you are a good person, you go to Heaven; if you are a bad person, you go to Hell. That is not the truth at all. That is what people think because they want to be rewarded for good behavior, and they want to punish others for their bad behavior.</p>
<p>它必须被理解，你在世上的角色和位置并非仅仅为了获得未来的回报。如果你是个好人，你就会上天堂；如果你是个坏人，你就会下地狱。这根本不是事实。人们之所以这样想，是因为他们希望因好行为而获得奖励，并希望因坏行为而惩罚他人。</p>
<p>In reality, everyone is sent to the world to work. And everyone comes to the world to work because they want to come to the world to work. You leave a place of peace and equanimity into a world of division and conflict where God is unknown, where truth is unknown, where people live lives based upon personal fear and ambition, in a world where survival is difficult and nature is harsh and exacting.</p>
<p>在现实中，每个人都被派到这个世界来工作。每个人来到这个世界工作，是因为他们想来工作。你离开一个和平与平等的地方，来到一个充满分裂与冲突的世界。在这里，上帝不为人知，真理不为人知，人们的生命建立在个人的恐惧和野心之上。在这里，生存艰难，自然严酷无情。</p>
<p>If you are living a life according to this purpose and mission, even if it has not yet been fully revealed to you, you will feel a sense of integrity in your life. You will feel a sense of abiding purpose. And you will experience Grace.</p>
<p>如果你按照这个目的和使命生活，即使它尚未完全向你显现，你也会感受到你生命的完整性。你会感受到一种永恒的目的。你也会体验到恩典。</p>
<p>If you are not living this life, if you are not close to living this life, then you will feel confusion, anxiety, frustration, anger, resentment, and you may attach yourself to radical ideas, politics or religion. You may associate yourself with radical groups. You may give yourself to political causes. You may immerse yourself in addictions or aberrant behavior. But your fundamental problem is you are not aligned with the purpose that has brought you into the world, a purpose that only Knowledge, the deeper Intelligence within you, knows and holds for you.</p>
<p>如果你没有活出这种生命，如果你没有接近这样的生命，那么你就会感到困惑、焦虑、沮丧、愤怒、怨恨，你可能会依附于激进的想法、政治或宗教。你可能会与激进的团体交往。你可能会投身于政治事业。你可能会沉迷于成瘾或异常行为。但你的根本问题是，你没有与带你来到这个世界的目的保持一致，而这个目的只有内识，你内在更深层次的智能，才能知晓并为你持有。</p>
<p>It is necessary that when people come into the world, they forget their Ancient Home. You are entering a completely different reality here, completely different. Entering a physical body, assuming a personal identity, assuming a name and a position in society, identifying with your own physical and psychological characteristics, being driven by emotions and by the emotions of others and the expectations of others and the expectations of your nation, religion or culture—you become something very different than what you really are.</p>
<p>当人们来到这个世界时，他们有必要忘记他们的古老家园。你正在进入一个完全不同的现实，完全的不同。进入一个物质身体，承担一个个人身份，承担一个名字和一个社会地位，认同你自身的生理和心理特征，被情绪、他人的情绪、他人的期望以及你的国家、宗教或文化的期望所驱使——你变成了某种与你真正的样子截然不同的存在。</p>
<p>Being in the world is a role that you play. It is not your permanent reality. It is not your true identity. You may claim all kinds of different identities, and you may try to identify with these roles completely, but the truth of your real nature and the truth of your purpose for coming into the world is held with Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>身处世界是你扮演的一个角色。它并非你永恒的现实。它并非你真正的身份。你或许宣称各种不同的身份，你或许试图完全认同这些角色，但你实际自然的真理，以及你来到世界的目的的真理，都由你内在的内识所持有。</p>
<p>The great awakening, the redemption that must take place, is reconnecting your thinking mind—your personal mind that has been conditioned and shaped by culture, family and religion—to the deeper Mind that God has placed within you, the Mind of Knowledge. For this is the only way that you will be able to follow the wisdom and the power that God has placed within you.</p>
<p>伟大的觉醒，必须发生的救赎，正在重新连接你的思维心灵——你被文化、家庭和宗教熏陶和塑造的个人心灵——与上帝放置在你内在更深层次的心灵，内识的心灵。因为这是你能够遵循上帝置于你内在的智慧和力量的唯一途径。</p>
<p>Here your mission and purpose is not simply a definition. It is not simply a name tag that you wear. It is not a job description. It is a direction that you follow, a mysterious direction, but a direction that creates very tangible results. And it is this direction, over time, that defines you and reveals to you where you are going and what your life is really about.</p>
<p>在这里，你的使命和目的并非仅仅是一个定义。它并非仅仅是你佩戴的名牌。它并非一份工作描述。它是你遵循的一个方向，一个神秘的方向，但也是一个能够创造切实成果的方向。正是这个方向，随着时间的推移，定义了你，并向你揭示了你的方向以及你生命的真正意义。</p>
<p>The notion of creating your own reality is only relevant in the sense that you can follow Knowledge and allow it to reveal to you your true nature and purpose in the world. Here you do have to set a new course for yourself. Here you do have to break away from the overbearing influence of society and culture. Here you do have to create a personal reality that can allow Knowledge to emerge within you.</p>
<p>创造你自己的现实这个概念只有在你能够遵循内识并允许它向你揭示你在世界上的真正自然和目的的意义上才是有意义的。在这里，你确实必须为你自己设定一条新的道路。在这里，你确实必须摆脱社会和文化的霸道影响。在这里，你确实必须创造一个能够让内识在你内在呈现的个人现实。</p>
<p>But most people use the idea of creating reality as weaving a new fantasy for themselves—trying to recreate themselves; trying to create a new thought process, a new experience, a new self-identity. Yet it is this very motivation that created the Separation from God in the first place.</p>
<p>但大多数人把创造现实的想法当作为他们自己编织一个新的幻想——试图重塑他们自己；试图创造一个新的思想过程、一个新的体验、一个新的自我认同。然而，正是这种动机首先造成了与上帝的分离。</p>
<p>Why recreate yourself when God has already created you? Why try to determine the nature and direction of your life when God has given you your true nature and your true direction in life—waiting to be discovered, waiting to be followed and experienced? Why try to redefine who you are and what you are and what you do when God has already created all these things within you, waiting to be discovered?</p>
<p>当上帝已然创造了你，为何还要重塑你自己？当上帝已然赋予你你真正的自然和你生命中的真正方向——正等待着被发现，正等待着被追随和体验——为何还要试图决定你生命的自然和方向？当上帝已然创造了你内在的一切，正等待着被发现，为何还要试图重新定义你是谁，你是什么，你要做什么？</p>
<p>The desperate attempt to be someone, to have something, to do something, to gain recognition, to make people believe in you or love you or follow you is such a desperate attempt and is so foreign to your true nature. The struggle for wealth, the struggle for recognition, the struggle for self-validation and self-fulfillment—these are all desperate struggles that consume people’s lives and energy while their true nature and their true purpose remain undiscovered and unexpressed.</p>
<p>拼命地想要成为某个人，拥有某种东西，做某件事，获得认可，让别人相信你、爱你或追随你，这种尝试是如此的绝望，与你的真实自然如此格格不入。为财富而奋斗，为认可而奋斗，为自我认同和自我满足而奋斗——这些都是绝望的挣扎，它们消耗着人们的生命和能量，而他们的真实自然和真正的目的却未被发现和表达。</p>
<p>So even if you are able to attain your goals through great adversity, through great self-determination, you are still left empty and disassociated from yourself. You are still angry and frustrated and confused. No matter how rigid you become in your beliefs or your ideology or your attempt to attain your goals or to fulfill your ideas, your life still remains undiscovered and unexperienced. The Separation has not been bridged within you, the Separation between your thinking mind, where you live 99% of the time, and the deeper Mind of Knowledge.</p>
<p>所以，即使你能够克服巨大的逆境，凭借强大的自决力达成目标，你依然会感到空虚，与自我分离。你依然愤怒、沮丧、困惑。无论你的信仰、意识形态，无论你多么执着于实现目标或满足你的想法，你的生命依然未被发现，未被体验。你内在的分离尚未弥合，你的思维心灵（你99%的时间都生活于此）与更深层次的内识心灵之间的分离尚未弥合。</p>
<p>At the outset, people often experience Knowledge as intuition. They have insights. They have foreknowings about things. They sense things are wrong. They are drawn to other things. They are drawn away from some things. Yet these inclinations are rarely valued and followed. And it is unfortunate because this is God trying to help you, to guide you, to protect you from error, to counsel you not to give yourself to your next great pursuit in life and to give you a sense that your life already has a true meaning and direction, a true purpose and expression.</p>
<p>起初，人们常常将内识体验为直觉。他们拥有洞察力。他们对事物有预知。他们感知到事情是错误的。他们被其他事物吸引。他们被某些事物吸引而远离。然而这些倾向很少被重视和遵循。这很不幸，因为这是上帝在试图帮助你，引导你，保护你免于错误，劝告你不要把你自己交给你生命中的下一个伟大追求，并让你感觉到你的生命已然拥有一个真正的意义和方向，一个真正的目的和表达。</p>
<p>In a sense, you need to get out of the way so that it can emerge within you. You need to begin to listen patiently and take the steps that Knowledge within you will give you to take without trying to define the outcome, without trying to determine the direction, without trying to control the process.</p>
<p>从某种意义上说，你需要让开道路，这样它才能在你内在浮现。你需要开始耐心聆听，并采取你内在内识赋予你的步骤，而不试图定义结果，不试图决定方向，不试图控制过程。</p>
<p>People pray to God for many things. They want safety. They want protection. They want their goals to be fulfilled. They want their loved ones to be saved. They want their business enterprise to succeed. They want their marriage to succeed. They want their children to succeed. But they will not allow God to move in their lives. They want these things, but they want to control the process. They want to be in charge of what happens and how it happens and what it produces.</p>
<p>人们向上帝祈求很多事物。他们想要安全。他们想要保护。他们想要实现他们的目标。他们想要亲人得救。他们想要事业成功。他们想要婚姻美满。他们想要孩子成功。但他们不允许上帝进入他们的生命。他们想要这些，却又想掌控整个过程。他们想要掌控发生的事情、发生的方式以及结果。</p>
<p>Now does this mean that you simply become a passive observer in your life? Of course not. What Knowledge will require of you is tremendous self-focus and discipline. It requires that you override the tendencies that weaken you and engage you inappropriately with people and activities. It is this power that breaks your addictions. It is this power that prevents you from giving your life away to meaningless pursuits and to damaging relationships.</p>
<p>那么，这是否意味着你只是成为了你生命中一个被动的观察者？当然不是。内识要求你高度的自我专注和自律。它要求你克服那些削弱你、让你不适当地参与他人和活动的倾向。正是这种力量打破了你的成瘾。正是这种力量阻止你将生命交给毫无意义的追求和有害的关系。</p>
<p>This will require a greater self-discipline from you than you have ever exercised before. It will require restraint on your part. It will require self-examination. It will require that you organize your affairs appropriately and correctly. Most people’s lives at this point, whether they be rich or poor, are far too out of control for them to be able to experience and to follow Knowledge effectively.</p>
<p>这将要求你比以往任何时候都更加自律。它将要求你克制自己。它将要求你自我反省。它将要求你恰当且正确地安排你的事务。大多数人的生命在此时此刻，无论贫富，都过于失控，以至于他们无法有效地体验和遵循内识。</p>
<p>For your life to become truly expressive and creative and powerful, it must become very simple. You cannot be managing twenty different things at once. The New Message gives a very clear understanding of what it means to maintain balance in life through building and maintaining the Four Pillars of your life: the Pillar of Relationships, the Pillar of Work and Providership, the Pillar of Health and the Pillar of Spiritual Development.</p>
<p>为了让你的生命变得真正富有表现力、富有创造力且充满力量，它必须变得非常简单。你无法同时管理二十件不同的事情。新讯息清晰地阐释了如何通过构建和维护你生命的四大支柱来维持生命的平衡：关系支柱、工作和供养支柱、健康支柱以及精神发展支柱。</p>
<p>Like the four legs of a table, this supports you, this maintains you, this enables you to carry greater responsibilities and greater work in the world. To build these Pillars takes a lot of self-discipline, a lot of focus, a lot of personal responsibility.</p>
<p>就像桌子的四条腿，它支撑着你，维持着你，使你能够在世界上承担更伟大的责任和更艰巨的工作。构建这些支柱需要高度的自律、高度的专注和高度的个人责任感。</p>
<p>So here you are not simply sitting back and letting God manage and control your life. That is ridiculous. God has more important things to do than try to manage your life.</p>
<p>所以，你不是简单地袖手旁观，让上帝掌控你的生命。这太荒谬了。上帝有比掌控你的生命更重要的事情要做。</p>
<p>But what God has done is place within you a deeper Intelligence that knows your mission and purpose for being in the world and has no other distractions. It is not confused. It is not angry. It is not reacting against the world. It is not ambitious. It is not deceitful. Yet it is here on a mission, your mission.</p>
<p>但上帝所做的，是将一种更深层次的智能置于你的内在，它知晓你身处世界的使命和目的，并且不受其他干扰。它不困惑。它不愤怒。它不对抗世界。它不野心勃勃。它不欺骗。然而，它在此肩负着一个使命，你的使命。</p>
<p>God knows that if you entered the world, you would never be able to find your mission without Knowledge. You would become lost in the world, consumed by the world, dominated by the world—your thoughts, your actions, your emotions—controlled by the events of the day, by your reactions to the world and other people’s reactions to the world, that you would become lost and drown in a sea of confusion and anguish, anger and ambition.</p>
<p>上帝知道，如果你进入世界，没有内识，你将永远无法找到你的使命。你将迷失在世界中，被世界吞噬，被世界支配——你的思想，你的行动，你的情绪——被每日发生的事件、你对世界的反应以及他人对世界的反应所控制，你将迷失并淹没在困惑、痛苦、愤怒和野心的海洋中。</p>
<p>That is why Knowledge has been given to you—a perfect, guiding Intelligence. And yet to allow Knowledge to emerge, your life must be brought in order. Your activities must be consistent and in harmony with one another. Your relationships must support this emergence and not compete with it. Just preparing yourself to respond to Knowledge, to experience Knowledge, is a tremendous act of personal responsibility and personal freedom.</p>
<p>正因如此，内识被赋予你——一个完美的、指引性智能。然而，为了让内识出现，你的生命必须井然有序。你的活动必须前后一致，彼此和谐。你的关系必须支持这个浮现，而非与之竞争。仅仅是让你自己做好准备去回应内识，去体验内识，就是一个关乎个人责任和个人自由的极大行动。</p>
<p>For if you are not being with Knowledge and following Knowledge, then you are a slave to other forces. You are a slave to the expectations of others. You are a slave to your personal possessions. You are a slave to your need for security. You are a slave to the expectations of certain people. You are a slave to your own fear and your own desires.</p>
<p>因为如果你不与内识同在并遵循内识，那么你就是其他力量的奴隶。你就是他人期望的奴隶。你就是你的个人财产的奴隶。你就是你的安全感需求的奴隶。你就是某些人期望的奴隶。你就是你自己的恐惧和你自己渴望的奴隶。</p>
<p>As a result, you are really pathetic. Whether you are poor or rich, you are spiritually poor. You are bereft. You are empty. You may claim an allegiance to God. You may say you believe in God. You may fervently believe in the dictates of your religion. But your heart is closed and your mind is fixated.</p>
<p>结果，你真是可悲。无论贫穷还是富有，你的精神都是贫乏的。你失去了一切，你空虚无力。你或许声称效忠上帝。你或许说你信仰上帝。你或许虔诚地信奉你的宗教教义。但你的心是封闭的，你的心灵固执己见。</p>
<p>Truly today, as in the past, there are many people who claim to be religious, who are devout in their beliefs, but who are not guided by Knowledge. They have created their own religion and their own religious focus. They have adhered themselves to a belief system, to a set of principles, but they are not following the wisdom that God has placed within them.</p>
<p>确实，今天，就像过去一样，有很多人自称有宗教信仰，虔诚地信奉他们的信仰，但却不受内识的指引。他们创造了他们自己的宗教和他们自己的宗教焦点。他们坚持一个信仰体系，坚持一套原则，但他们没有遵循上帝赋予他们内在的智慧。</p>
<p>So the problem remains, and it is fundamental. They are acting on belief not on Knowledge. Belief is weak and fallible and susceptible to all forms of manipulation and control by others. You cannot find God through belief. You need a certain amount of belief to orient your mind correctly, but what bridges the gap between your seemingly separated life and the Presence of God in your life is Knowledge.</p>
<p>所以问题依然存在，而且是根本性的。他们基于信仰而非内识行事。信仰软弱、易错，容易受到他人各种形式的操控和控制。你无法通过信仰找到上帝。你需要一定程度的信仰来正确引导你的心灵，但弥合你看似分裂的生命与你生命中上帝存在之间鸿沟的，是内识。</p>
<p>God remains beyond the definitions and the intellectual scope of human beings and all sentient beings in the universe. But you can know of God and of God’s Presence within you and within the world because this is a direct experience. This is the experience of Knowledge within you and Knowledge functioning within others.</p>
<p>上帝超越人类以及宇宙中所有有情众生的定义和智力范围。但你可以知道上帝，知道上帝在你内在以及世界内的存在，因为这是一种直接的体验。这是你内在内识以及内识在他者内在运作的体验。</p>
<p>You do not even have to be a religious person to have this experience, to experience the Presence of God, to experience God moving in your life—the urgency within you to move your life in a certain direction, to become something that you need to become, to do something that you need to do, to break free of your current circumstances if that is necessary.</p>
<p>你甚至不必是一位宗教人士，就能拥有这种体验，体验上帝的存在，体验上帝在你生命中的活动——你内在的紧迫感，将你的生命推向某个方向，成为你需要成为的某种人，做你需要做的某事，如果有必要的话，摆脱你当前的境况。</p>
<p>You do not have to be a religious person to experience this. But you are having a religious experience. Again, there is a big difference between the form and the essence of things.</p>
<p>你不必是个宗教人士就能体验到这一点。但你正在经历一种宗教体验。再说一次，事物的形式和本质之间存在着巨大的差异。</p>
<p>People can claim to be religious, even vehemently religious, and yet have no spiritual connection at all. And there are others who claim no religious affiliation, who seem to be entirely secular, yet they are having a religious experience.</p>
<p>有些人可能自称信教，甚至虔诚地信教，但实际上却没有任何精神上的联接。还有些人声称自己没有宗教信仰，看起来完全是世俗的，但他们却拥有宗教体验。</p>
<p>When Jesus said, “No man comes to the Father except through me” he means that no one can experience God except through Knowledge. At that point, he was so completely identified with Knowledge that he could make that statement and it would be true.</p>
<p>当耶稣说：“若不借着我，没有人能到父那里去”时，他的意思是，若不借着内识，没有人能体验上帝。在那一刻，他已经完全与内识融为一体，以至于他能说出这番话，而且这番话是真的。</p>
<p>But, of course, this and many other teachings about Jesus and the other great saints of the world have been misinterpreted, have been used by political forces and ambitious individuals to control the thoughts and behavior of people and to gain power themselves.</p>
<p>但是，当然，这个教导以及关于耶稣和世界其他伟大圣徒的许多其他教导都被误解了，被政治力量和野心勃勃的个人用来控制人们的思想和行为，并为他们自己获取权力。</p>
<p>Yet before this, there is a great current of Knowledge. Like a great deep water current in the ocean, it is moving the waters of the world. So even while the surface of the ocean is turbulent and seems completely dominated by the weather conditions, in the depths something greater is moving.</p>
<p>然而在此之前，有一股伟大的内识之流。如同海洋中一股浩瀚的深水巨流，它正在推动着世界的水流。因此，即使海洋表面波涛汹涌，似乎完全受天气状况所左右，但在深处，一种更伟大的力量正在涌动。</p>
<p>This is a good analogy for your life, for while your mind is turbulent and swayed by the winds of the world, beneath you there is a deeper current. It is this deeper current that is the movement of God, the Intelligence that God has placed within you to guide and to protect you and to prepare you to live a greater life—a life of purpose, meaning and direction. This is fulfillment. Because you were meant to serve the world, the world calls it out of you. But you must be in a position to respond.</p>
<p>这是对你生命的一个很好的比喻，因为当你的心灵动荡不安，被世界的风吹拂时，在你的下方，存在着一股更深层次的潮流。正是这股更深层次的潮流，是上帝的运动，是上帝置于你内在的智能，为了指引你、保护你，并让你准备活出一个更伟大的生命——一个有目的、意义和方向的生命。这就是成就。因为你注定要服务世界，所以世界召唤你。但你必须能够做出回应。</p>
<p>If your life is completely caught up in what you have created for yourself, you are bound by circumstances and obligations and expectations and relationships. If your life is in disarray, if the Four Pillars of your life have never been built or established, you cannot respond to a greater calling. You do not have the power to do it. You do not have the freedom to do it. You do not have the self-trust to do it.</p>
<p>如果你的生命完全陷入你为你自己创造的生命，你就被境遇、义务、期望和关系束缚。如果你的生命陷入混乱，如果你生命的四大支柱从未被构建或确立，你就无法回应一个更伟大的召唤。你没有力量去做它。你没有自由去做它。你没有自我信任去做它。</p>
<p>You may feel it, and it may shake you to the soul, but you are imprisoned in a life that you have allowed to be built up around you, or that you have actively established yourself. It is better here that this recognition not occur, for it will create such conflict for you. Because God wants to bring you to your realization as safely as possible, as smoothly as possible, the revelation is slow and incremental.</p>
<p>你或许能感受到它，它或许能震撼你的灵魂，但你被囚禁在一种你允许在你周围构建，或你自己主动建立起来的生命之中。最好不要发生这种认知，因为它会给你带来巨大的冲突。因为上帝希望尽可能安全、尽可能顺利地让你领悟，所以启示是缓慢而渐进的。</p>
<p>The first work of God is to unburden you, to free you from situations and circumstances that cannot serve the emergence of Knowledge within you. This usually means relationships with people, with places, with things and activities.</p>
<p>上帝的首要工作是卸下你的负担，将你从那些无法服务于你内在内识呈现的境况和环境之中解放出来。这通常意味着与人、与地点、与事物和活动的关系。</p>
<p>In lieu of people experiencing the reality of Knowledge and the guidance of Knowledge, they build entire lives for themselves. They circumscribe themselves with duties and obligations and activities. They unite with others, they join groups, they become married, they build families, everything, before they have any sense of who and what they are in the world. The truth of this is all around you.</p>
<p>人们没有体验到内识的现实和内识的指引，而是为他们自己构建了整个人生。他们用责任、义务和活动限制他们自己。他们与他人结合，他们加入群体，他们结婚，他们建立家庭，做所有的一切，却还没有意识到他们在世界上是谁，他们是什么。这一切的真理就在你身边。</p>
<p>So to quell the spiritual need, people believe in religion, but belief in religion does not bridge the gap. It does not bring you to Knowledge necessarily. For certain individuals, that will be the case, but for many people, they remain lost and confused and unfulfilled.</p>
<p>因此，为了平息精神上的需求，人们信仰宗教，但信仰宗教并不能弥合鸿沟。它不一定能带你走向内识。对某些人来说，情况确实如此，但对很多人来说，他们依然迷失、困惑、未得到满足。</p>
<p>Because here we are not talking about the fulfillment of your wishes and your desires—your desire for pleasure and wealth and recognition, comfort, security and safety—we are talking about the need of the soul. The need of your soul is to find your mission and to fulfill it. And the only way you can recognize it and know what it really is and take the steps towards it is by re-engaging with Knowledge because only Knowledge knows what it is.</p>
<p>因为在这里，我们谈论的并非你的愿望和渴望的满足——你对快乐、财富、认可、舒适、安全感和安全的渴望——我们谈论的是灵魂的需求。你灵魂的需求是找到你的使命并去履行它。而你可以认出它、知道它真正是什么、并迈向它的唯一方式，就是重新参与内识，因为唯有内识知道它是什么。</p>
<p>God has put this Knowledge in you to give you a chance at success in this world. God speaks to you through Knowledge. God’s Will is expressed to you through Knowledge.</p>
<p>上帝将这个内识赋予你，是为了让你有机会在这个世界上获得成功。上帝通过内识与你对话。上帝的意志也通过内识向你表达。</p>
<p>If you are not inner directed, you are outer directed. You are directed by the world—by people, by family, by religion, by social obligations and conventions. You are a slave to other forces. Even if they are very beneficial, you are still a slave to them. You must follow dutifully, like sheep, like cattle.</p>
<p>如果你不受内在指引，你就会受外在指引。你被世界指引——被人、被家庭、被宗教、被社会义务和习俗指引。你成了其他力量的奴隶。即使它们对你非常有益，你仍然是它们的奴隶。你必须尽职尽责地跟随，就像绵羊、牛群一样。</p>
<p>God has placed a deeper Intelligence within you that is not bound to these things necessarily. It may work within them or outside of them. It may work through conventional religion or outside of conventional religion. You cannot control what it is, for you have a destiny. You did not create this destiny. You did not create this reality. It created you. So instead of trying to create your reality, find the reality that created you and that is here to guide and protect you in a dangerous world facing grave and serious change now on the horizon.</p>
<p>上帝已经将一个更深层次的智能置于你的内在，它并不一定受制于这些事物。它或许在它们之内运作，或许在它们之外运作。它或许通过传统宗教运作，或许在传统宗教之外运作。你无法控制它是什么，因为你拥有一个天命。你并未创造这个天命。你并未创造这个现实。它创造了你。因此，与其试图创造你的现实，不如去寻找创造你的现实，它在此指引和保护你，在这个危险的、正面临严峻而严重变革的世界里，这个世界如今正冉冉升起。</p>
<p>Knowledge will bring you to the world, for you must serve the world. You must help humanity in your own unique and appointed way. Perhaps you will serve only one or two people, take care of one or two people. Perhaps you will take care of wildlife or the environment. Perhaps you will serve the interests of your local community or your local church. Perhaps you will serve the interests of your nation or the international community. You are designed for whatever this is. Your personality, your traits, your strengths, your limitations, your natural orientation—everything is designed for this purpose.</p>
<p>内识将带你走向世界，因为你必须服务世界。你必须以你自己独特且指定的方式帮助人类。或许你将只服务一两个人，照顾一两个人。或许你将照顾野生动物或环境。或许你将服务你当地社区或你当地教会的利益。或许你将服务你的国家或国际社会的利益。无论这是什么，你都是为此而设计的。你的人性，你的特质，你的优势，你的局限，你的自然取向——一切都是为了这个目的而设计的。</p>
<p>But if you do not know what this purpose is, then you do not understand your design. You do not know why you are the way you are because it has no context. You do not fit anywhere. So either you make yourself fit in with what everyone thinks and wants and believes, or you are sort of an outcast living in a state of perpetual discomfort and disassociation.</p>
<p>但如果你不知道这个目的是什么，你就无法理解你的设计。你不知道你为什么会是现在这个样子，因为它缺乏背景。你无法融入任何地方。所以，你要么让你自己融入所有人的想法、愿望和信仰，要么成为一个被抛弃的人，生活在一种永远的不适和分离之中。</p>
<p>Yet no matter however confusing things might seem, Knowledge within you is absolutely certain. When you take the Steps to Knowledge, you allow this certainty to slowly emerge in your awareness. You allow it to guide your steps. Perhaps they are just baby steps at the outset, but they are steps.</p>
<p>然而，无论事情看起来多么令人困惑，你内在的内识都是绝对确定的。当你踏上内识进阶时，你让这份确定性在你的觉知中慢慢浮现。你让它指引你的脚步。或许一开始它们只是婴儿般的小步，但它们终究是步伐。</p>
<p>You do not get up the mountain by being whisked away on a magic carpet. You do not climb into the elevator and ride your way to the top. You must take the steps. How do you get from here to there? You take the steps. How do you get up the mountain to a place where you can see clearly beyond the confinement of the forests and the hills? By getting up the mountain. By taking the steps.</p>
<p>你不可能坐上魔毯，就能爬上山顶。你也不可能坐电梯，一路攀升到山顶。你必须踏上台阶。你如何从这里到达那里？你必须踏上台阶。你如何登上山顶，到达一个可以清晰地看到森林和山丘之外的地方？你必须登上山顶，踏上台阶。</p>
<p>If you keep climbing, you will reach this place of clarity and accomplishment. And you will render unique forms of service to people and to life along the way. This gives you a sense of rightness about your life. Your life is still undefined and mysterious, but there is a sense now of rightness about your life, and this is precious.</p>
<p>如果你不断攀登，你终将抵达这明晰而成就的境界。你将在此过程中，以独特的方式为他人、为生命服务。这赋予你一种对生命的正确感。你的生命依然模糊而神秘，但现在你对生命有了正确的认识，而这非常珍贵。</p>
<p>This is what people are striving for in their pursuit of wealth and pleasure, comfort and security. They are trying to get right with their life, but they are not right with their life, for they are not connected yet. They are not connected to Knowledge. They are not connected to God.</p>
<p>这就是人们在追求财富和快乐、舒适和安全时所追求的。他们努力让他们的生命变得正确，但他们的生命并没有变得正确，因为他们尚未联接。他们没有联接到内识。他们没有联接到上帝。</p>
<p>So as you begin to take the Steps to Knowledge, as you begin to allow Knowledge to reveal to you what you really need to do, as you appeal to what you know as opposed to what you believe or what you want, there is a greater and increasing sense of rightness as your life is rearranged and brought into a greater order, a greater simplicity and a greater harmony.</p>
<p>因此，当你开始开展内识进阶时，当你开始允许内识向你揭示你真正需要做什么时，当你诉诸你所知道的，而非你所相信的或你想要的时，你将拥有一种更伟大且不断增长的正确感，因为你的生命被重新安排，并被带进一种更伟大秩序、一种更伟大简朴和一种更伟大的和谐之中。</p>
<p>There are so few people in the world today who are really where they need to be, doing what they need to be doing. That is why in the minds and hearts of people everywhere, there is a discomfort. There is a frustration. There is a lack of peace and contentment. There is an anger. There is a yearning.</p>
<p>当今世界，真正身处其位、做其事的人如此之少。正因如此，世界各地人们的心灵中都弥漫着不安、沮丧、缺乏和平与满足。内心中充满着愤怒，也充满着渴望。</p>
<p>You cannot take this away from people by enriching them or by giving them pleasurable circumstances. Many people in the world today simply need the basics of life. They need that first, and then they can approach a greater meaning and a greater purpose.</p>
<p>你无法通过丰富人们的生活或给予他们愉悦的境遇来剥夺这一点。当今世界上许多人只是需要生命的基本要素。他们首先需要这些，然后他们才能接近更伟大的意义和更伟大的目的。</p>
<p>But you must understand that people are not where they need to be, and that is why they are uncomfortable, that is why they are restless, that is why they give themselves to things that are reckless.</p>
<p>但你必须理解，人们没有处在他们需要处的地方，这就是为什么他们感到不舒服，这就是为什么他们焦躁不安，这就是为什么他们把他们自己投入到鲁莽的事情中。</p>
<p>If you are going to serve God, you must let God serve you first. You must begin to make the connection. There is no fulfillment apart from this. There is no real satisfaction apart from this.</p>
<p>如果你要服务上帝，你必须先让上帝服务你。你必须开始建立这种联接。除此之外，别无成就。除此之外，别无真正的满足。</p>
<p>You cannot be true to yourself and be disconnected from Knowledge, for Knowledge is the truth of yourself. It is the memory of your Ancient Home. It is the sense that you are sent here for a purpose, and you must allow this purpose to reveal itself to you incrementally as you go along. You must allow for this mystery to be in your life.</p>
<p>你无法忠于你自己却又与内识脱节，因为内识是你自己的真理。它是你古老家园的记忆。它是你为了某个目的被派到这里的感受，你必须允许这个目的在你前行的过程中逐渐向你揭示它自己。你必须允许这个神秘存在于你的生命中。</p>
<p>If you are a person who lives on assumptions and definitions, you basically have no certainty. You are pretending. To come to Knowledge is to give up your assumptions about life, for they are the substitutes for God. You are placing your certainty on the belief in things external to you. How can you do this without denying your relationship with God?</p>
<p>如果你是一个活在假设和定义上的人，你基本上没有确定性。你正在假装。走向内识就是放弃你对生命的假设，因为它们是上帝的替代品。你把你的确定性寄托在你外在事物的信仰上。你怎么能做到这一点而不否认你与上帝的关系呢？</p>
<p>You must gain this greater vulnerability to allow Knowledge to guide you and to protect you. Everyone may want to go one way. Knowledge wants you to go another. How will you have the strength and confidence to follow Knowledge if you are guided and dependent upon what everyone else thinks or wants or does? You will not be able to do it. You will be swayed by the group, and you will go with them even though it is catastrophe to do so.</p>
<p>你必须获得这种更伟大的脆弱性，才能让内识指引你、保护你。每个人或许都想走一条路。内识却希望你走另一条路。如果你被引导，并依赖于其他人的想法、愿望或行为，你怎么会有力量和信心去追随内识呢？你将无法做到。你将受群体左右，你将跟随他们，即使这样做会带来灾难。</p>
<p>What is fulfillment? Fulfillment is fulfilling what you came here to do. Only Knowledge knows what you came here to do because Knowledge was put within you by God.</p>
<p>什么是成就？成就就是完成你来此要做的事。只有内识知道你来此要做的事，因为内识是由上帝置于你内在的。</p>
<p>You must start then as a beginner, even if you have done spiritual practice for years. Even if you are deeply involved in your religion, you are a beginner in The Way of Knowledge. You claim no other accomplishments if you seek to really learn, for all true students are beginning students.</p>
<p>所以，你必须从初学者开始，即使你已经精神练习多年。即使你深谙宗教，你在内识之路上也只是一名初学者。如果你真正地追求学习，你不会取得其他成就，因为所有真正的学生都是初学者。</p>
<p>To be a beginning student is to be a consummate learner, is to have humility, is to be able to look again to reconsider. If you think you know the truth, then the truth is beyond your reach. Truth emanates from Knowledge. It emanates from real actions, real service, real giving, real relationships, real activities and real accomplishment.</p>
<p>成为一名初学者意味着成为一名完美的学习者，意味着拥有谦逊，意味着能够重新审视和反思。如果你认为你知道真理，那么真理就遥不可及。真理源于内识。它源于真实的行动、真实的服务、真实的给予、真实的关系、真实的活动和真实的成就。</p>
<p>You are not here to understand life. You are here to serve life. And Knowledge has your form of service and contribution already established.</p>
<p>你来此不是为了理解生命。你来此是为了服务生命。内识已经为你服务和贡献的形式奠定了基础。</p>
<p>Now how this works out is dependent upon many things in the world, so everything that occurs is not preordained. Your direction is preordained. Your gift is preordained. But how it will be expressed, where it will be expressed, or even if it will be expressed is dependent upon the situation in the world. It is dependent upon whether other people who are meant to be part of your service make their rendezvous with you. It depends on the conditions of life. It depends on many things, mostly beyond your control.</p>
<p>现在，这一切如何运作取决于世界上的很多事情，所以发生的一切都不是注定的。你的方向是注定的。你的礼物是注定的。但它将如何表达，它将在何处表达，甚至它是否会被表达，都取决于世界的状况。它取决于那些注定要成为你服务一部分的其他人是否与你会合。它取决于生命的条件。它取决于很多事情，其中​​大部分都超出了你的控制范围。</p>
<p>All you can do is do your part. If you do your part, you will feel right about your life. This is a form of confirmation far more valuable than any form or source of pleasure or stimulation. Even spiritual ecstasy cannot compete or compare with this sense of rightness about your life. That means your mind and your heart are working together now and not apart. That means all of you is involved. You are not a bunch of separate individuals all going in different directions, connected to different things.</p>
<p>你所能做的就是做好自己的部分。如果你做好自己的部分，你就会对自己的生命感到满意。这是一种确认，远比任何形式的快乐或刺激的来源都更有价值。即使是精神上的狂喜也无法与这种对生命的正确感受相媲美。这意味着你的心灵和你的内心现在正在协同工作，而不是分开。这意味着你们所有人都参与其中。你不再是一群分离的个体、朝着不同的方向、与不同的事物相连。</p>
<p>You cannot change your mission and your purpose, but circumstances will determine where, how and if it can be expressed. Clearly, if you are in a situation where people are starving to death, the expression of your purpose would have to adapt itself to that set of circumstances.</p>
<p>你无法改变你的使命和目的，但环境将决定它能否在何处、如何以及能否得以表达。显然，如果你处在一个人们正在饿死的境地，你目的的表达就必须适应当时的环境。</p>
<p>Change in the world will accelerate now. Great change is upon the world, difficult change. The power of this change has the power to call your purpose from you, but you must be in a position to respond. You must come to Knowledge with open hands, an open heart and an open mind.</p>
<p>世界的改变现在将加速。世界正在经历巨大的改变，艰难的改变。这变革的力量能够唤醒你的目的，但你必须能够做出回应。你必须带着开放的双手、开放的心和开放的心灵走向内识。</p>
<p>If your life is completely circumscribed by everything you have built around it, then you are like a prisoner. You cannot respond. And you will be afraid to respond, afraid that if you experience Knowledge, it would somehow upset all that you have created. It would challenge your ideas and your obligations and your assumptions and so forth.</p>
<p>如果你的生命完全被你围绕它构建的一切所限制，那么你就像一个囚徒。你无法回应。你将害怕回应，害怕如果你体验内识，它会以某种方式颠覆你所创造的一切。它会挑战你的想法、你的义务、你的假设等等。</p>
<p>This is the problem with personal achievement. It must follow Knowledge to be genuine and authentic and constructive. If it precedes Knowledge, well, then it becomes an immense impediment.</p>
<p>这就是个人成就的问题所在。它必须遵循内识才能真实、可靠且富有建设性。如果它先于内识，那么它就会成为极大的障碍。</p>
<p>When people are born again, their lives are refocused and reshaped to allow Knowledge to emerge within them. This is what it means to really be born again, instead of just adopting a new belief system and trying to immerse yourself in a belief system.</p>
<p>当人们重生时，他们的生命被重新聚焦、重塑，以允许内识在他们内在涌现。这才是真正重生的意义，而非仅仅接受一个新的信仰体系，并试图让你自己沉浸其中。</p>
<p>Knowledge is calling to you. Within yourself, you have a growing sense that you are here to do something important, and you will look around and you will think, “Well, I don’t see it happening. I must do something new or different. Something is moving me.”</p>
<p>内识正在召唤你。你内心深处越来越感觉到，你来此是为了做一件重要的事情，而你环顾四周，心想：“嗯，我看不到任何进展。我必须做点新的、不同的事情。有什么东西正在驱使我。”</p>
<p>What Knowledge will do for you then is give you steps to follow to begin to reshape and refocus your life. For until that happens, until your Four Pillars become substantial enough and correctly built, then you have no possibility of living a greater life.</p>
<p>内识将为你做的，是赋予你遵循的步骤，开始重塑和重新聚焦你的生命。因为除非这发生，除非你的四大支柱变得足够坚实且正确构建，否则你不可能活出更伟大的生命。</p>
<p>Now many people who are living in very impoverished situations, they cannot really change their circumstances very much, but the emergence of Knowledge is still potent within them.</p>
<p>现在很多人生活在非常贫困的环境中，他们无法真正改变他们的境遇，但内识的涌现仍然在他们内在强大。</p>
<p>Knowledge is not fooled by the world. It is smarter than the world. It represents a little part of God’s Intelligence that has been put within you. Your service can be rendered under any circumstance—an environment of political restraint and poverty or a wealthy, affluent environment. In either case, people are disconnected from Knowledge. They are disassociated. They are confused. They are suffering. They are angry.</p>
<p>内识不会被世界愚弄。它比世界更聪明。它代表着上帝的智能被置于你内在的一小部分。你的服务可以在任何境况下提供——无论是政治约束和贫困的环境，还是富裕富足的环境。无论哪种情况，人们都与内识脱节。他们疏离。他们困惑。他们受苦。他们愤怒。</p>
<p>Rich or poor, the poverty of the soul remains. The need of the soul remains. And the great promise of redemption through Knowledge remains.</p>
<p>无论贫富，灵魂的贫乏依然存在。灵魂的需求依然存在。通过内识获得救赎的伟大承诺依然存在。</p>
<p>The New Message from God is here to teach the reality of your spirituality at the level of Knowledge, to teach that redemption happens at the level of Knowledge—the reclamation of Knowledge, taking the Steps to Knowledge. It is not what people believe and think necessarily, and yet it has always been true. It has always been the case.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息在此教导你在内识层面的精神性现实，教导救赎发生在内识层面——唤回内识，开展内识进阶。它并非必然是人们所相信和思考的那样，然而它始终是真实的。它始终是这样的。</p>
<p>Your great saints and contributors in any field of endeavor have all been guided by Knowledge. Even if their personal behavior was not exemplary, they were being guided by Knowledge. They made their contribution. They struggled to make this contribution. They struggled against all the forces of conventional thinking, beliefs and attitudes to make their unique contribution—to break new ground for humanity, to keep Knowledge alive in the world, to stir people spiritually, to provide for people materially, to create greater opportunities for humanity, greater well-being for humanity and so forth, through every avenue of endeavor.</p>
<p>你们伟大的圣人和各领域的贡献者都受到了内识的指引。即便他们的个人行为并非典范，但他们也受到了内识的指引。他们做出了他们的贡献。他们奋力做出这种贡献。他们对抗着所有传统思维、信仰和态度的力量，做出他们独特的贡献——通过各种努力，为人类开辟新的天地，保持内识在世界上的活力，在精神上激励人们，在物质上供养人们，为人类创造更伟大的机会，为人类带来更伟大的福祉，等等。</p>
<p>And yet they remain distinct and unusual because people are still trying to fulfill themselves through their ideas, through their assumptions, through their beliefs, through their material acquisition.</p>
<p>然而，它们仍然是独特的和不寻常的，因为人们仍然试图通过他们的想法、他们的假设、他们的信仰、他们的物质获取来满足他们自己。</p>
<p>This is the problem of living in physical life. You forget about God. You are unaware of Knowledge within yourself, and so you try to build a fortress for yourself in the world—a fortress that can only fail and fall in time, a fortress that will corrupt you and isolate you and cast you apart, a fortress in which your children will grow up to be spoiled and insipid without any sense of responsibility to themselves or to the world.</p>
<p>这就是活在物质生命里的问题。你忘记了上帝。你没有察觉你内在的内识，因此你试图在世界上为你自己建造一座堡垒——一座只会随着时间而失败和倒塌的堡垒，一座将腐蚀你、孤立你、抛弃你的堡垒，一座你的孩子们将在其中长大，变得被宠坏、变得乏味，对他们自己或对世界没有任何责任感的堡垒。</p>
<p>Can this really be an honorable goal for people? To achieve a state of listlessness and recklessness? Is this what wealth produces? Personal corruption? Personal irresponsibility? Addiction? Self-obsession? Is this the wealth that everyone wants? To be inured from the world so you feel nothing and know nothing?</p>
<p>这真的能成为人们光荣的目标吗？达到一种倦怠和鲁莽的状态？这就是财富带来的结果吗？个人腐败？个人不负责任？上瘾？自我痴迷？这就是每个人都想要的财富吗？与世隔绝，感觉不到任何变化，一无所知？</p>
<p>There is a greater wealth. It has always been with you. It is here at this moment. It represents your redemption in the eyes of God. You may become famous in your culture. Others may think you are a great man or a great woman, but to God it only matters if you find and follow Knowledge and contribute the gifts of Knowledge that you are meant to contribute. This is fulfillment in this world and in all worlds throughout the Greater Community of life in the universe.</p>
<p>有一个更伟大的财富。它一直伴随着你。它此刻就在这里。它代表着你在上帝眼中的救赎。你或许在你的文化中成名。其他人或许认为你是一位伟人，但对上帝而言，唯有你发现并遵循内识，并贡献你注定要贡献的内识礼物，它才是重要的。这是这个世界以及整个宇宙生命大社区所有世界的成就。</p>
