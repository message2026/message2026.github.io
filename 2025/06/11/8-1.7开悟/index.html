<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on September 19, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 9 月 19 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is natural for people to want to discover their deeper nature, and to discover and to fulfill their greater purpose for coming into the world. For indeed everyone has been sent here for a greater purpose even though very few people have ever discovered this, or even understand that it is a reality for them.</p>
<p>人们自然而然地想要发现他们更深层次的自然，发现并实现他们来到这个世界的更伟大目的。因为事实上每个人都被派到这里是为了一个更伟大目的，尽管很少有人发现这一点，甚至理解这对他们来说是一个现实。</p>
<p>Once you have secured yourself in the world and have adequate provisions—food and water, shelter, clothing and security—a deeper set of needs sets in: the need for personal freedom and self-expression, the need for opportunity, the need to develop and cultivate one’s skills and abilities, the need for political freedom and economic opportunity. But beyond the possibility of fulfilling these needs, there is a greater and more fundamental need within the individual. And while many people in the world today cannot even fulfill the first set of needs for food and shelter and security, this deeper need resides within them as well.</p>
<p>一旦你在这个世界上安顿下来，拥有了充足的供给——食物、水、住所、衣服和安全——一系列更深层次的需求就会随之而来：对个人自由和自我表达的需求，对机会的需求，对发展和培养个人技能和能力的需求，以及对政治自由和经济机会的需求。然而，除了满足这些需求的可能性之外，个人内心深处还有一种更伟大、更根本的需求。虽然当今世界上许多人甚至无法满足食物、住所和安全这第一类需求，但这种更深层次的需求也存在于他们的内心深处。</p>
<p>That is one of the tragedies of poverty: it denies the possibility of a great percentage of humanity from making their contribution to the world. The countless individuals who would otherwise become major contributors to their cultures and societies, and to the well-being and progress of humanity, will not even have a chance to gain this greater expression of their lives. They are overtaken by their circumstances, prisoners of their circumstances.</p>
<p>这是贫困的悲剧之一：它剥夺了人类中很大一部分人对世界做出贡献的可能性。无数原本可以成为其文化和社会、人类福祉和进步的重要贡献者，却连实现其生命更伟大价值的机会都没有。他们被他们的条件所束缚，沦为境遇的囚徒。</p>
<p>Others who are more affluent become prisoners of their desires and their obsessions. They become prisoners to their ambitions or their personal interests, their romances or their addictions. In all of these cases, people are prevented from gaining access to their deeper nature, the deeper current of their life, and with it the possibility of experiencing and expressing a greater purpose that has brought them into the world.</p>
<p>其他较为富裕的人则沦为欲望和执念的囚徒。他们沦为野心或个人兴趣、恋情或成瘾的囚徒。在所有这些情况下，人们被阻碍触及他们更深层次的自然，他们生命的更深层次的潮流，以及随之而来的体验和表达将他们带到这个世界的一种更伟大目的的可能性。</p>
<p>For some people, enlightenment is held out to be the ultimate goal: to become free of attachment; free of worldly restraint; free to immerse yourself in a greater consciousness, the consciousness of all life, perhaps the consciousness of God; to be unhindered internally; to be free of anger and resentment and low self-esteem.</p>
<p>对于某些人来说，开悟被视为最终目标：摆脱执着，摆脱世俗的束缚，自由地沉浸在一种更大的意识中，所有生命的意识，也许是上帝的意识中；内心不受束缚；摆脱愤怒、怨恨和自卑。</p>
<p>For some people enlightenment then becomes their new obsession. They think that that is why they are here in the world—to escape the world, to escape the endless cycle of existence and all of the suffering and struggle and difficulty that that entails.</p>
<p>对某些人来说，开悟成了他们新的执念。他们认为这就是他们来到这个世界的原因——逃离这个世界，逃离无尽的轮回，以及随之而来的所有苦难、挣扎和困难。</p>
<p>If it were your purpose to discover the deeper Knowledge that God has placed within you and to follow that Knowledge and to be a vehicle for its expression in the world—if that were your definition of enlightenment, then enlightenment would be completely appropriate. But enlightenment, in the minds of many people, is something very different. It is a kind of personal exaltation. It is an escape from life. It is a retreat from the world. It is a great ambition.</p>
<p>如果你的目的是发现上帝放置在你内在的更深层次的内识，并遵循内识，并成为它在世界上表达的一个载体——如果那是你对开悟的定义，那么开悟将是完全合适的。但是，在很多人的心灵中，开悟是某种非常不同的东西。它是一种个人的提升。它是对生命的一种逃离。它是对世界的一次退隐。它是一种伟大的雄心。</p>
<p>Yet if the spiritual practices that lead in the direction of enlightenment can engage one with their deeper Knowledge, their deeper nature, then they will have to come back into the world to serve. For if you discover your deeper nature, if you experience the deeper mind of Knowledge within yourself, you will realize that you have a destiny in the world and a service to perform here, a very specific service involving certain individuals.</p>
<p>然而，如果通往开悟的精神修行能够使一个人接触到他们更深层次的内识、他们更深层次的自然，那么他们就必须回到世界去服务。因为如果你发现了你更深层次的自然，如果你体验了你自己内在内识的更深层次的心灵，你将意识到你在世界上有一个天命，你在这里有一个服务要履行，一个涉及特定个体的非常具体的服务。</p>
<p>Though you may have sought bliss and contentment, in actuality you find that you have a great service in the world, and you must return to the world with all of its difficulties, its tragedies and its seductions because this is why you have come into the world.</p>
<p>尽管你或许寻求了喜乐和满足，但实际上你发现你在世界上有一个伟大的服务，你必须带着它的所有困难、它的悲剧和它的诱惑回到这个世界，因为这就是你来到这个世界的原因。</p>
<p>You have not come into the world to escape the world. You have not come into the world to pursue personal happiness and satisfaction, for that only makes you a mass consumer, and it leads to self-obsession, which is the source of all mental illness.</p>
<p>你来到这个世界，不是为了逃避这个世界。你来到这个世界，也不是为了追求个人的幸福和满足，因为那只会让你成为一个大众消费者，并导致自我痴迷，而自我痴迷正是所有心理疾病的根源。</p>
<p>If your pursuit of enlightenment engages you with Knowledge, then you will be prepared to return to the world, and your form of service may engage you in very difficult situations, where the need is profound. You cannot escape this service, for it really represents your destiny.</p>
<p>如果你对开悟的追求让你投入到内识，那么你将准备好回归世界，你的服务形式可能会让你陷入非常艰难的境地，在那里需求是深刻的。你无法逃避这种服务，因为它真正代表着你的天命。</p>
<p>For some people, enlightenment however has nothing to do with Knowledge. It is a personal goal. It is the ultimate experience of happiness and contentment. And that is the goal of their lives: to be happy and contented.</p>
<p>然而，对某些人来说，开悟与内识无关。它是一种个人目标，是幸福与满足的终极体验。而这正是他们生命的目标：幸福与满足。</p>
<p>So they will spend their lives—all their resources, all of their self-determination—to try to eradicate or overcome or overlook all of the tendencies within themselves that keep them small and chained to the world. But they will also overlook the power and presence of Knowledge and what it is calling them to do. And they will have to face guilt, the guilt that they are not responding to their deeper nature and to the deeper need of the soul. But they will tend to dismiss this guilt as simply part of the limitations that they must overcome.</p>
<p>因此他们将耗费他们的生命——他们所有的资源，他们所有的自我决定——去试图根除、克服或忽视他们内在所有让他们变得渺小并被束缚于世界的倾向。但他们也将忽视内识的力量和存在，以及内识召唤他们去做的事情。他们将必须面对内疚，内疚于他们没有回应他们更深层次的自然和灵魂更深层次的需求。但他们倾向于将这种内疚简单地视为他们必须克服的局限的一部分。</p>
<p>Here there is a confusion, a misunderstanding, a misapprehension of the goal and purpose of your life. While peace and contentment are certainly important, these must be the by-product or the result of a deeper and more profound engagement in the world.</p>
<p>这里存在着一种困惑、一种错误理解、一种对你生命目标和宗旨的误解。虽然和平与满足当然重要，但它们必须是对世界一种更深层次、更深刻参与的副产品或结果。</p>
<p>To escape the world to pursue happiness is no different than trying to enrich yourself with possessions or with gaining high social position. It is still a focus on one’s own fulfillment. But you did not come into the world to fulfill yourself. You did not come here to be a mass consumer, to use everything in the world for your own edification, for your own satisfaction, for your own happiness.</p>
<p>逃避尘世去追求幸福，与试图用物质财富或高贵的社会地位来充实你自己并无二致。这依然是追求个人成就感。但你来到这个世界，并非为了成就你自己。你并非为了成为大众消费者，利用世间一切来提升你自身，满足你自身，追求你自身的幸福。</p>
<p>This is a very important point of clarification because if you do not see this, then you will think of enlightenment as a kind of noble road to take, the ultimate pursuit, the greatest adventure, the greatest and most significant challenge in life. But you risk missing what is fundamental to who you are and to the greater purpose that has brought you into the world.</p>
<p>这是一个非常重要的澄清点，因为如果你没有看见这一点，你就会把开悟视为一条值得走的崇高之路，视为终极追求，视为最伟大的冒险，视为生命中最伟大、最重要的挑战。但你可能会忽略那些构成你自然的根本，以及你来到这个世界的更伟大目的。</p>
<p>While it may be necessary to retreat from the world, for even extended periods of time, to build an inner connection to this deeper Knowledge that God has placed within you, to experience your life at a deeper and more profound level, and to gain a sense of true direction in life, this retreat from the world for most people must be temporary.</p>
<p>尽管可能需要从世界中退隐，即使很长一段时间，来构建与上帝放置在你内在的这种更深层次内识的一种内在联接，在一个更深层次、更深刻的层面上体验你的生命，并获得一种生命真正方向感，但对于大多数人来说，这种从世界中退隐必须是暂时的。</p>
<p>The person who is destined to become a monastic is a rare individual, and their participation in a monastic life must not be driven by the inability or the avoidance of functioning in the world. This represents a false motive. It does not come from the heart.</p>
<p>注定要成为僧侣的人是罕见的个体，他们参与修道生活绝不能出于无力或逃避世俗的驱使。这是一种错误的动机，并非发自内心。</p>
<p>You cannot purify yourself completely before you become of service to others. It is not possible because the service itself is part of the purification. And while it is true you cannot simply serve people without building an inner life and building a foundation in Knowledge within yourself, it is equally true that you cannot delay service indefinitely while you strive and struggle to gain a kind of perfection within yourself.</p>
<p>你无法在开始服务他人之前完全净化你自己。这是不可能的，因为服务本身就是净化的一部分。虽然你确实无法简单地服务他人而不在你内在构建一个内在生命和构建一个内识基础，但同样真实的是，在你努力奋斗以获得你自己完美的同时，你不能无限期地拖延服务。</p>
<p>The goal of your spiritual practice—in whatever form it takes, in whatever tradition it might exist—is to engage your surface mind, your worldly mind, with the mind of Knowledge that God has placed within you and to follow that Knowledge, which will bring you to experience and then to express your greater purpose for being in the world, which is a specific form of service to life.</p>
<p>你精神练习的目标——无论它采取何种形式，无论它存在于何种传统中——是将你的表面心灵、你的世俗心灵与上帝放置在你内在的内识心灵进行一种联接，并遵循内识，它将带你去体验并随后表达你身处世界的更伟大目的，这是服务生命的一种特定形式。</p>
<p>Do not think that you are healing the world through your spiritual practice alone, though your spiritual practice does cast a beneficial influence in the mental environment. You have a greater service to perform. Even those living in monasteries must serve one another and do this out of a state of humility and respect.</p>
<p>不要认为你仅凭精神练习就能疗愈世界，尽管你的精神练习确实对心理环境产生了有益的影响。你还有更伟大的服务要做。即使是住在修道院的人也必须彼此服务，并且要怀着谦逊和尊重去做。</p>
<p>For life is service for a sentient being. You are not merely a plant or an animal that just has to survive and reproduce. You are here for a greater purpose. You are not here to be a locust upon the world, consuming everything in sight. You are here for a greater purpose.</p>
<p>因为生命就是为有情众生服务。你不仅仅是一株植物，也不仅仅是一只只需要生存和繁衍的动物。你在这里是为了一个更伟大的目的。你在这里不是为了成为世界上的蝗虫，吞噬一切。你在这里是为了一个更伟大的目的。</p>
<p>It is this greater purpose that represents the fulfillment of your soul and the fulfillment of your destiny. To do this adequately frees you from having to return to this level of life. For this will end Separation within yourself and build a strong enough connection to what God has placed within you, and to God, that you will not need to enter into physical life again. Your service then will be on another level. It will be a greater service and a greater responsibility.</p>
<p>正是这个更伟大目的代表着你灵魂的成就和你天命的实现。做到这一点，足以让你摆脱重返这个生命层面的束缚。因为这将终结你内在的分离，并与上帝放置在你内在的一切，以及与上帝，建立一种足够强大的联接，以至于你将无需再次进入物质生命。你的服务将在另一个层面上。它将是一种更伟大的服务以及一种更伟大的责任。</p>
<p>Do not seek perfection. You cannot perfect your personal mind, you cannot perfect your body, you cannot live a life of perfect equanimity without divorcing yourself from the world and without divorcing yourself from Knowledge within yourself. No matter how long you take to engage in spiritual practice, you must return to the world to serve.</p>
<p>不要去追求完美。如果不脱离世界，如果不脱离你内在的内识，你就无法完善你的个人心灵，你无法完善你的身体，你无法过上一种完美平静的生命。无论你花多长时间进行精神练习，你都必须回归世界去服务。</p>
<p>Everyone was sent into the world to serve. But service requires preparation. It requires the right attitude and the right understanding.</p>
<p>每个人都被派到世界上来进行服务。但服务需要准备。它需要正确的态度和正确的理解。</p>
<p>There are many people who are engaged in service as a kind of compensation for their own lack of integrity, and for their own inability to be honest about their lives and to engage with other people truthfully and appropriately. So they seek to counteract the sense of guilt and inadequacy that this produces by engaging in various forms of service. But their service is a kind of self-compensation. It is tied up in their own compromised lives and approach to life.</p>
<p>许多人从事服务，是为了弥补他们自身缺乏的完整性，无法诚实地面对生命，无法真诚恰当地与他人交往。因此，他们试图通过参与各种形式的服务来抵消由此产生的内疚感和不足感。但他们的服务其实是一种自我补偿，与他们自身妥协的生命和生活方式息息相关。</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not complete. It is not authentic. It does not have the power of Spirit within it. It is more a form of escape, a form of avoidance, an attempt to prove to oneself [one’s] own worth and value.</p>
<p>因此，它并不完整。它并不真实。它也不具备精神的力量。它更像是一种逃避，一种回避，一种试图证明自身价值的尝试。</p>
<p>This is not real service. That is why you must take the Steps to Knowledge and build a connection to Knowledge before you try to give your life to service. In this sense, you must build a foundation, for you cannot determine the form of service. You may try. You may try many different things, you may give yourself to many different things, and while this may be beneficial for others, it may lead you nowhere.</p>
<p>这不是真正的服务。正因为如此，在你尝试将你的生命交给服务之前，你必须开展内识进阶，并构建与内识的一种联接。从这个意义上讲，你必须构建一个基础，因为你无法决定服务的形式。你可以尝试。你可以尝试很多不同的事情，你可以将你自己交给很多不同的事情，尽管这可能对他人有益，但它可能让你一事无成。</p>
<p>For you were born with a greater purpose. The form of the service that you are destined to give lives within you, kept sacred and safe within Knowledge within you. You cannot figure it out with your intellect. It is not based upon your personal goals or ambitions.</p>
<p>因为你生来就带着一个更伟大的目的。你注定要奉献的服务形式存在于你的内在，并被你内在的内识神圣且安全地守护着。你无法用你的智力去理解它。它并非基于你的个人目标或野心。</p>
<p>You must yield to Knowledge within yourself, and learn to find this greater purpose, and distinguish it from all the other compulsions and expectations in your mind, and gain the strength and the inner freedom to give yourself in this direction—thus overcoming your other ambitions, thus requiring you to reconcile your life, to bring your life in order and to withdraw from your self-destructive pursuits and from your compromised relationships, which really have nowhere to go and cannot produce anything of value to the world.</p>
<p>你必须臣服于你内在的内识，学习发现这个更伟大目的，并把它与你心灵中所有其他的冲动和期望区分开来，并获得力量和内在自由来把你自己交给这个方向——从而克服你的其他野心，从而要求你和解你的生命，让你的生命井然有序，并从你的自我毁灭的追求和你妥协的关系中抽身，它们真的无处可去，无法为世界带来任何有价值的东西。</p>
<p>This is the self-purification of taking the Steps to Knowledge. But it is not the same as trying to become perfect according to one’s notions or ideals, or the ideals of anyone else, or even the ideals of religion and religious teaching.</p>
<p>这是开展内识进阶中的自我净化。但这不同于试图按照自己的观念或理想，或任何其他人的理想，甚至宗教和宗教教导的理想去变得完美。</p>
<p>Instead of personal exaltation, it is coming down into the truth within oneself. It is a reconciliation. It is not an escape from life. It is a re-engagement with life. And that begins with the re-engagement with the deeper current of life in your life, the thread of truth that has existed every day of your life.</p>
<p>它并非个人的升华，而是回归自身内在的真理。它是一种和解。它并非逃避生命。它是与生命的重新契合。而这始于与你生命中更深层次的生命之流，与你生命中每一天都存在的真理之线的重新契合。</p>
<p>While you may have built an existence that is unrelated to this deeper thread of truth, it remains. It is your lifeline to God. It is the core and center of your real life. Even if you have created a life full of other obligations and commitments and attachments, it is this deeper thread of your life that you must reconnect with.</p>
<p>尽管你可能构建了一种与这条更深层次的真理之线毫不相关的存在，但它依然存在。它是你通往上帝的生命线。它是你真实生命的核心与中心。即使你创造了一种充满其他义务、承诺和依恋的生命，你也必须重新连接你生命中这条更深层次的真理之线。</p>
<p>Only Knowledge knows why you are here and what you are here to do. So while you may attempt to do any number of other things, trying to fulfill yourself or even trying to serve the world, only Knowledge within you knows where you need to go and what you need to do. And even more importantly, Knowledge knows the pathway you must follow to prepare yourself, to regain your integrity and your clarity of mind in order to recognize and to render this greater service.</p>
<p>只有内识知道你为何在此，以及你在此做什么。因此，尽管你可能尝试做许多其他事情，试图成就你自己，甚至试图服务世界，但只有你内在的内识知道你需要去往何方，你需要做什么。更重要的是，内识知道你必须遵循的道路，以便准备你自己，重新获得你的完整性和你心灵的清晰，从而认知并呈现这个更伟大服务。</p>
<p>Here personal ambition and self-avoidance are great obstacles to reconnecting with Knowledge. People have invested heavily in their personal pursuits, in their personal relationships. They want to keep trying to prove that their investment was wise and efficacious. So they keep trying to make it work. They keep trying to make their relationship work or their pursuit in life be successful. And they keep trying and keep trying and keep trying, only postponing the day when they realize that they are not moving in the right direction and that their constant investment of themselves and their resources is only furthering and deepening their dilemma.</p>
<p>在这里，个人野心和自我回避是重新联接内识的巨大障碍。人们在他们的个人追求、他们的人际关系上投入了大量资金。他们想要不断努力证明他们的投入是明智和有效的。因此他们不断努力让它发挥作用。他们不断努力让他们的关系运作起来，或者让他们的生命追求获得成功。他们不断尝试、不断尝试、不断尝试，只是在推迟他们意识到他们没有朝着正确方向前进的那一天，以及他们对他们自身和资源的持续投入只会进一步加深他们的困境。</p>
<p>That is why you must begin by taking the Steps to Knowledge, for this will bring clarification into your life. This will restore to you your greater power and greater sense of certainty. This will free you from other obligations or commitments that have no future and which are only wasting your life.</p>
<p>正因为如此，你必须从开展内识进阶开始，因为这将为你的生命带来清晰。这将为你重建你更伟大的力量和更伟大的确定性。这将使你摆脱其他没有未来、只会浪费你生命的义务或承诺。</p>
<p>Never think in this regard that you are right where you need to be, for in truth you are trying to get up a mountain. You are trying to get up beyond the valleys and the trees to see and to know and to have the clarity to understand the parameters of your life and the greater journey you must take.</p>
<p>在这方面，永远不要认为你正处于你需要去的地方，因为事实上你正在努力攀登一座山。你正在努力超越山谷和树木去看见、去知道，并拥有清晰性去理解你生命的界限以及你必须踏上的更伟大旅程。</p>
<p>Here many things will have to be set aside—even enlightenment. Personal goals, ambitions, ultimate achievements—they are all driven by personal insecurity and self-doubt.</p>
<p>在这里，许多事情都必须搁置一旁——甚至连开悟也一样。个人目标、抱负、终极成就——所有这些都是由个人的不安全感和自我怀疑所驱动的。</p>
<p>Without Knowledge to guide your mind, your mind is like a wandering child. It is like an orphan in the world, forever insecure and fearful, forever feeling inadequate and longing for some kind of reunion or reconnection with a greater reality. It drives you. It drives you ceaselessly to try to find yourself in people, places, things, or even in enlightenment.</p>
<p>没有内识来指引你的心灵，你的心灵就像一个流浪的孩子。它就像世间的孤儿，永远不安全、恐惧，永远感到不足，渴望与更伟大现实的一种重聚或重新连接。它驱使着你。它不断地驱使着你，试图在人群、地点、事物，甚至在开悟中寻找你自己。</p>
<p>Whatever the stated goal, the driving incentive is the same. It is born of Separation. It is born of the fact that you are not connected to Knowledge and that your personal mind is running wild, trying to seek fulfillment, trying to seek security, trying to seek happiness, trying to seek the ultimate happiness. It is driven by insecurity and a profound sense of personal failure.</p>
<p>无论既定目标是什么，驱动力都是一样的。它源于分离。它源于你没有联接内识，你的个人心灵正在狂奔，试图寻求成就，试图寻求安全，试图寻求幸福，试图寻求终极幸福。它被不安全感和深刻的个人失败感所驱动。</p>
<p>As you continue to dedicate yourself to these pursuits, whatever they may be, your sense of personal failure and anxiety only increases, for you have not met the deeper need of your soul. And though you keep trying to fulfill your goals and ambitions, they keep robbing you of time and diminishing your opportunity to gain access to Knowledge and to reconnect yourself, your mind, your consciousness with the greater purpose that has brought you into the world.</p>
<p>当你继续奉献你自己于这些追求时，无论它们是什么，你的个​​人失败感和焦虑感只会增强，因为你尚未满足你灵魂更深层次的需求。尽管你不断努力去实现你的目标和野心，但它们却不断夺走你的时间，减少你接触内识，并重新联接你自己、你的心灵、你的意识以及带你来到这个世界的更伟大目的的机会。</p>
<p>Some people may say: “Well, there is no real greater purpose for me. I am just here to become enlightened so I can become free of the world and its restraints.” But this is the kind of ultimate expression of Separation, that there is no greater purpose for that person. They are just here to try to create an ultimate reality for themselves or to leap into ultimate reality as they conceive of it.</p>
<p>有些人可能会说：“好吧，我在这里并没有什么真正的更伟大目的。我来到这里只是为了获得开悟，这样我就能摆脱这个世界和它的束缚。”但这正是分离的终极表达，即这个人没有更伟大的目的。他们来到这里只是为了试图为他们自己创造一种终极现实，或者跃入他们所构想的终极现实。</p>
<p>But their problem is that what is motivating them is fear and anxiety, and a profound sense of deficiency in their own life and nature. They are trying to create and fulfill the answer, but the answer has already been given to you.</p>
<p>但他们的问题是，驱动他们的是恐惧、焦虑，以及他们自身生命和自然中深刻的缺失感。他们试图创造并实现答案，但答案早已经赐予你。</p>
<p>The answer was given at the beginning of time when the Separation began. God instantly created Knowledge in all sentient beings—a deeper conscience, a deeper sense of connection and responsibility, a deeper experience of fulfillment and relationship.</p>
<p>答案在时间之初，即分离之初便已经给出。上帝瞬间在所有众生心中创造了内识——一种更深层次的良知，一种更深层次的联结与责任感，一种更深层次的成就感与关系的体验。</p>
<p>If your idea of enlightenment is aimed towards Knowledge, then it is appropriate. But your understanding is still incomplete. For you must see that your pursuit of clarity, certainty and strength will lead you to a greater form of service in the world. The goal is not bliss or contentment or peace, but instead engagement at a higher level.</p>
<p>如果你对开悟的理解是指向内识，那么它是恰当的。但你的理解仍不完整。因为你必须看见，你对清晰性、确定性和力量的追求，将引领你为世界提供一种更伟大的服务。目标并非喜悦、满足或和平，而是更高层面的参与。</p>
<p>If your idea of enlightenment is to achieve a kind of escape from life, then you must reconsider your objectives, and consider seriously the reality that God has already placed the answer within you, and that you cannot find this answer alone only through spiritual practice. For the answer is a movement. It is not just one realization. It is not just one sudden moment where your eyes are opened and your mind is completely clear.</p>
<p>如果你认为开悟是为了逃避现实，那么你必须重新审视你的目标，认真思考上帝早已将答案置于你内心的现实，而你无法仅凭精神练习找到答案。因为答案是一种运动。它不仅仅是一次顿悟。它不仅仅是一个瞬间，你的眼睛睁开，你的心灵完全清醒。</p>
<p>You may have such lucid moments as a product of your spiritual practice, but ultimately you are here to come to terms with the greater movement of your life—a movement that has a direction and a purpose in the world, a movement that will take you into the world to engage with certain people for a greater and more specific purpose.</p>
<p>你或许会拥有这样清醒的时刻，这是你精神练习的产物，但最终你来此是为了适应你生命的更伟大运动——一个在这个世界上有着一个方向和一个目的的运动，它将带你走向世界，为了一种更伟大、更特定的目的与特定的人接触。</p>
<p>The separated are reclaimed everywhere in the universe through Knowledge. Whatever your understanding or orientation, whatever be the nature of your spiritual practice, the truth remains that you are saved through Knowledge.</p>
<p>宇宙中所有分离的个体都通过内识获得救赎。无论你的理解或取向如何，无论你的精神练习的自然如何，真理始终不变：你通过内识获得拯救。</p>
<p>Knowledge is not some distant shore. It is not some remote place. It is not the result of a long and arduous journey. It is within you now. It is talking to you every day, but you cannot hear it because your mind is too full of noise and is too engaged in its own pursuits.</p>
<p>内识并非遥远的彼岸。它不是遥远的地方。它不是漫长艰辛旅程的成果。它此刻就在你的内心。它每天都在与你对话，但你却听不到，因为你的心灵充满了噪音，你过于专注于它自身的追求。</p>
<p>It is not perfection you seek, but this deeper engagement and this deeper relationship with God. This brings you back into the world to contribute something to the flow and evolution of life here, and to the well-being of humanity, and to the world. Do not try to define this ultimate role for yourself, for that will only hinder your progress.</p>
<p>你寻求的并非完美，而是这种与上帝的更深层次的参与和这种更深层次的关系。这带你回归世界，为这里生命的流动和进化，为人类的福祉，为世界的福祉做出贡献。不要试图为你自己定义这个终极角色，因为这只会阻碍你的进步。</p>
<p>Here your mind must live with questions and not rely upon answers. You must have the sense of security and self-confidence to know that you are on the right track, that you are moving up a great mountain, that you cannot leap to the summit and that you do not know what the summit is or what it will be like or what it will mean for you. You do not know what you will see as you gain a greater altitude on this mountain. So you go forward with a kind of faith, but it is not a passive faith, for you are fully engaged in your preparation.</p>
<p>在这里，你的心灵必须带着问题生活，而非依赖答案。你必须拥有安全感和自信，知道你走在正确的道路上，你正在攀登一座高山，你无法跃上顶峰，你不知道顶峰是什么，它将会是什么样子，它对你意味着什么。你不知道当你在这座山上攀登到更高的高度时，你会看到什么。因此你带着一种信念前行，但这不是一种被动的信念，因为你完全投入于你的准备之中。</p>
<p>You are not waiting around for a bolt of lightning to strike you. You are not waiting around for some magical event or some miracle to open your eyes. You are making the journey. You are getting up the mountain, step by step. You are learning to take the Steps to Knowledge, to gain an ever greater sense and experience of the deeper current of your life. This is more a process of letting things go than taking things on, more a process of reducing yourself to what is really essential and real in your life as opposed to taking on more ideas, more activities, more commitments, more relationships.</p>
<p>你不是在等待一道闪电击中你。你不是在等待某个神奇的事件或奇迹来打开你的双眼。你正在踏上旅程。你正在一步步攀登高峰。你正在学习迈向内识的进阶，去获得对你生命更深层次潮流的更伟大的感知和体验。这与其说是一个承担的过程，不如说是一个放下的过程；与其说是一个承担更多想法、更多活动、更多承诺、更多关系的过程，不如说是一个将你自己缩减到生命中真正重要和真实生命的过程。</p>
<p>It is like an emptying out, but it occurs gradually because you must choose along the way what to value and what not to value. You must see what is good from what only looks good. You must gain this wisdom through discernment, through decisions, through the process of assuming certain responsibilities and letting others go.</p>
<p>它就像一种清空，但它是逐渐发生的，因为你必须一路选择什么值得珍惜，什么不值得珍惜。你必须从那些仅仅看起来美好的事物中，辨别出什么是美好的。你必须通过辨识、通过决策、通过承担某些责任并放下其他责任的过程，来获得这种智慧。</p>
<p>That is why sudden enlightenment does not mean anything; it is only a moment. You must still make the journey. There is no secret magic carpet that is going to take you up this mountain. The presence of a great teacher, even contact with the Angelic Presence, will not transport you up this mountain. You must make the journey.</p>
<p>正因如此，顿悟并不意味着什么；它只是一瞬间。你仍需踏上旅程。没有神秘的魔毯能带你登上这座山。即使有一位伟大的老师在场，甚至与天使的存在接触，也无法将你送上这座山。你必须踏上旅程。</p>
<p>It is in making this journey that you become strong, that you gain wisdom, that you mature as a person, that you learn to make wise decisions, and discern with greater and greater clarity the truth and the falsity that exist in so many things, and to separate them, and to discern truth from falsity in an ever-increasing number of situations. You learn to do this without condemnation, without self-hatred or hatred for others. You become more sober about life, more clear about life, but ever connecting with the promise of life.</p>
<p>正是在这段旅程中，你变得强大，获得智慧，成熟，学会做出明智的决定，越来越清晰地辨别存在于万物之中的真伪，并将它们区分开来，在越来越多的情境中辨别真伪。你学会做到这一点，不带谴责，不带自我憎恨，也不带对他人的憎恨。你对生命更加清醒，更加清晰，却始终与生命的承诺相连。</p>
<p>There are spiritual teachers, or those who claim to be spiritual teachers, who promise enlightenment, liberation, complete freedom, complete contentment, a life without difficulty, a life without conflict. But what is this? It is an escape from life. It is an avoidance. It is like giving someone a drug, and having them become addicted so they do not have to experience themselves or their condition anymore.</p>
<p>有些精神导师，或者那些自称是精神导师的人，承诺给予人开悟、解脱、彻底的自由、完全的满足，以及一种没有苦难、没有冲突的生命。但这究竟是什么呢？这是对生命的逃避。它是一种回避。它就像给一个人下药，让他们上瘾，这样他们就不必再经历他们自己或他们的处境了。</p>
<p>People who are attracted to this are unwilling to live a real monastic life, with all of its restrictions and restraints. They want to have the world, but they want to have it on their terms. They want the world they want. They are unwilling to face the world as it is. They want to have love, but they cannot accept themselves or the world, and so love remains beyond their reach. They want to feel good about themselves, but underneath within themselves, they do not feel good about themselves, for they are neglecting some kind of primal responsibility in life. They are missing a connection.</p>
<p>受此吸引的人不愿过真正的修道生活，不愿承受其所有的限制和约束。他们想要拥有世界，却又想按照他们的意愿去拥有。他们想要他们想要的世界。他们不愿面对世界的本来面目。他们想要爱，却无法接受他们自己或世界，因此爱对他们来说遥不可及。他们想要自我感觉良好，但在内心深处，他们却自我感觉不佳，因为他们忽视了生命中某种原始的责任。他们缺失了一种连接。</p>
<p>So they try harder. They become more adamant in their spiritual practice. They become more critical of their own state of mind. They become more judgmental of others, seeking to have their idea of perfection or liberation.</p>
<p>所以他们更加努力。他们在精神修行上变得更加坚定。他们对他们自身的心灵状态更加挑剔。他们对他人更加评头论足，追求他们理想中的完美或解脱。</p>
<p>It is like the person who is going to seek material wealth, and they are going to do whatever it takes. They are going to forfeit their relationships. They are going to forfeit their health. They are going to forfeit participation in life to achieve their goals. They are determined; they are obsessed.</p>
<p>它就像一个人为了追求物质财富，不惜一切代价。他们甚至会放弃人际关系，放弃健康，放弃参与生命，只为实现目标。他们意志坚定，痴迷不已。</p>
<p>God has already placed an answer within you, but this answer will only emerge as you are prepared for it and as your desire for it becomes pure and clear. It will emerge as your life is brought into greater order and harmony, as you have reconciled your activities and have become honest about your engagements with other people.</p>
<p>上帝已经将一个答案置于你的内在，但这个答案唯有当你为它做好准备，当你对它的渴望变得纯粹和明晰时，才会呈现。当你的生命被带入更伟大的秩序与和谐，当你和解了你的活动，并对你与他人的交往变得坦诚时，它才会呈现。</p>
<p>Then the world itself will call this Knowledge out of you, for you cannot call it out of yourself. The world will activate your greater purpose. It will tell you where you need to serve, where your service can be of the greatest benefit, to whom it must be directed, and how it must be expressed.</p>
<p>然后，世界本身会从你身上唤出这种内识，因为你无法从你自己身上唤出这种内识。世界将激活你的更伟大目的。它将告诉你，你需要在哪里服务，你的服务在哪里能带来最大的益处，你的服务必须面向谁，以及必须如何表达。</p>
<p>How different this is from people trying to fulfill their idea of enlightenment, or trying to escape the ego in all things. Here it is the ego that wants to escape the ego. The ego goes along for the ride. It is being empowered. Even while you seek to escape its limitations, it continues with you.</p>
<p>这和那些试图实现开悟想法，或试图在一切事物中摆脱自我的人是多么不同啊。在这里，是自我想要逃离自我。自我随波逐流。它被赋予了力量。即使你试图摆脱它的局限，它仍然会继续与你同在。</p>
<p>It is like trying not to feel pain. If you try not to feel any emotional or physical pain, you will withdraw from life. Life is uncomfortable. Life is challenging. Life presents problems and predicaments, some of which are very difficult to understand and to resolve. Some you cannot resolve. If you do not want to feel these things, then you are taking yourself somewhere else, removing yourself from the world and removing yourself from the possibility of fulfilling your greater purpose here.</p>
<p>它就像试图不去感受痛苦。如果你试图不去感受任何情绪或身体上的痛苦，你就会逃避生命。生命是不舒适的。生命充满挑战。生命呈现着问题和困境，其中一些非常难以理解和解决。有些你无法解决。如果你不想感受这些事情，那么你就是在把你自己带往别处，把你自己从世界上移除，把你自己从实现你在此的更伟大目的的可能性中移除。</p>
<p>Your first responsibility is to take the Steps to Knowledge. Your second responsibility is to bring your life into order, which means that everything you are doing is true and that you have gained the strength to release obligations, commitments, behaviors and attachments that do not represent this fundamental truth within yourself. For many people, this takes years and years, but it must occur.</p>
<p>你的首要责任是开展内识进阶。你的第二项责任是让你的生命井然有序，这意味着你所做的一切都是真实的，并且你获得了力量去释放那些不代表你内在这个根本真理的义务、承诺、行为和执着。对许多人来说，这需要很多年，但它必须发生。</p>
<p>Then you learn to look at the world without condemnation. You look to listen, to feel the need for Knowledge in the world, and to see where Knowledge within you is taking you.</p>
<p>然后，你学会不带谴责地看待世界。你去倾听，去感受世界对内识的需求，去看见你内在的内识将引领你走向的方向。</p>
<p>Here you are going from an old life to a greater life, but you cannot put a greater life on top of an old life. You are taking a journey from one reality to another, but you are in the world while you are doing this. And you are maintaining your spiritual practice in The Way of Knowledge while you are doing this.</p>
<p>在这里，你正从一个旧的生命走向一种更伟大的生命，但你无法将更伟大的生命置于旧的生命之上。你正从一个现实走向另一个现实，但当你这样做的时候，你身处世界。当你这样做的时候，你正维持着你在内识之路上的精神练习。</p>
<p>Unless you are destined to become a monastic, which is a very unique role with very specific requirements, do not think you are going to escape the world. Do not think that you are going to live in the world but not in the world. That is like being in relationship but not really being in a relationship, which is the condition of so many people’s relationships. Yes, they are there, but not wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>除非你注定要成为一名僧侣——这是一个非常独特的角色，有着非常特定的要求——否则不要认为你就能逃离这个世界。不要认为你活在世间却又不属于这个世界。那就像你身处一段感情却并非真正的感情，而这正是很多人的感情状况。是的，他们存在，但并非全心全意地存在。</p>
<p>You have to be in the world wholeheartedly. You cannot be ambivalent about this. Otherwise, you just want the pleasures of the world without any of its pains, and this is dishonest. This is unreal. That is like wanting to be in the ocean without getting wet. This is wanting to be in a relationship without experiencing difficulties in communication and in understanding another person. This is like having only dessert for dinner and missing that which really nourishes you.</p>
<p>你必须全心全意地活在世上。你不能对此感到矛盾。否则，你只想享受世间的快乐，却不想承受任何痛苦，这是不诚实的。这是不真实的。这就像想在大海里畅游却浑身不沾水。这就像想在恋爱中不经历沟通和理解的困难。这就像晚餐只吃甜点，却错过了真正滋养你的东西。</p>
<p>Enlightenment is either true or false, depending on where it is taking you and what it is emphasizing. If it is a path to Knowledge, if it is a preparation for a greater engagement in life, then it is moving in the right direction. Yet if it is not oriented in this manner, then it is taking you somewhere else. It is deepening your self-obsession. It is taking you further from the world, further from true relationship, further into yourself, a self that has no reality in reality.</p>
<p>开悟要么是真实的，要么是虚假的，取决于它带你去哪里，以及它强调什么。如果它是一条通向内识的道路，如果它是为生命中更伟大参与的一种准备，那么它就朝着正确的方向前进。然而，如果它不是以这种方式导向，那么它就带你去别的地方。它加深了你的自我痴迷。它带你远离世界，远离真正的关系，深入你自己，一个在现实中没有现实的自我。</p>
<p>Here your understanding must be clear. You were sent into the world for a purpose, so you do not need to create your purpose. God has given you Knowledge to redeem you, so you do not have to redeem yourself. God has given you a greater direction in life, so you do not have to create this direction. But you do have to actively prepare—to discover Knowledge, to bring your life into order, and to take the steps towards experiencing and expressing a greater purpose in life, which the world more than anything else will reveal to you.</p>
<p>在这里，你的理解必须是清晰的。你被派到世界上是为了一个目的，所以你无需创造你的目的。上帝赋予你内识来救赎你，所以你无需救赎你自己。上帝赋予你生命中一个更伟大方向，所以你无需创造这个方向。但你必须积极地进行准备——去发现内识，去让你的生命井然有序，并迈出通往体验和表达生命中一个更伟大目的的步伐，这个世界比其他任何事物都更能向你揭示这个目的。</p>
<p>Here you gain a greater relationship with the world, a greater relationship with yourself, and a greater relationship with others. And it is these greater relationships that end the Separation within yourself, that demonstrate you are really connected to life and to a greater life beyond this world. This ends Separation in all directions. It establishes relationships above you and below you and all around you, simultaneously.</p>
<p>在这里，你获得了与世界的一种更伟大关系，与你自己的一种更伟大关系，以及与他人的一种更伟大关系。正是这些更伟大关系终结了你内在的分离，证明了你真正地联接着生命，以及联接着超越这个世界的一个更伟大生命。这终结了所有方向的分离。它同时在你之上、在你之下以及在你周围建立了关系。</p>
<p>This is how God’s Plan works. It is not the purification of the intellect. It is not just a shedding of the ego. For the more attention you give to your ego, the stronger it becomes. It loves attention; it lives off of attention and investment. Here you can diverge from your true path and spend your life trying to seek a goal that you yourself cannot fulfill.</p>
<p>这就是上帝计划的运作方式。它并非净化智力，也并非仅仅摆脱自我。因为你越关注你的自我，它就越强大。它喜欢关注；它依赖关注和投入而生存。在这里，你可能会偏离你真正的道路，耗尽一生去追寻一个你自己无法实现的目标。</p>
<p>For it takes a greater surrendering, not to a distant God or a distant power, not to a spiritual teacher, not to an idea or a set of beliefs, but to the deeper current of your life, which is here to take you somewhere and to prepare you for living in the world in a very different way.</p>
<p>因为它需要一种更伟大的臣服，不是臣服于一个遥远的上帝或一种遥远的力量，不是臣服于一位精神导师，不是臣服于一个想法或一套信仰，而是臣服于你生命的更深层次的潮流，它在此带你去某个地方，并让你为以一种非常不同的方式生活在世界上进行准备。</p>
<p>God has sent a New Message into the world to clarify these things, and to provide Steps to Knowledge. There are other pathways to Knowledge that have been established over time in the world, and many of them are very potent and authentic. But they can be very hard to find. And those that teach them are not in the public arena and can be very difficult to find. That is why God has sent the Steps to Knowledge into the world, to become a pathway for people who cannot find any other way and who need the blessings and the power of Knowledge in their lives today.</p>
<p>上帝向世界发送了一条新讯息，来阐明这些，并提供内识进阶。随着时间的推移，世界上已经建立了其他内识路径，其中许多非常有力且真实。但它们可能非常难以找到。而那些教导它们的人并不在公共领域，可能非常难以找到。正因如此，上帝向世界发送了内识进阶，成为那些无法找到任何其他道路，并在当今生命中需要内识祝福和力量的人们的一条路径。</p>
<p>God’s New Message also reveals humanity’s destiny within a Greater Community of intelligent life in the universe, and how humanity must prepare for the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world, as your planet undergoes environmental change.</p>
<p>上帝的新讯息也揭示了人类在宇宙智能生命大社区中的天命，以及随着你们的星球经历环境变化，人类必须如何为即将降临世界的变革巨浪做好准备。</p>
<p>To understand your purpose, you must understand the context in which it will be expressed, and that is why a permanent retreat from the world is so counter productive.</p>
<p>要理解你的目的，你必须理解表达它的背景，这就是为什么永久地退出世界是如此适得其反。</p>
<p>You must learn of humanity’s emergence into a Greater Community of life and the great threat to human freedom that is existing in the world today by those forces from the universe who are here to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity. And you must learn of the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world: environmental degradation, resource depletion, violent weather, changing climate, growing economic and political instability, and the threat of war and conflict. You are here to be a part of all of this, so you must learn of the condition of the world and what is coming over the horizon, which only a Revelation from God can provide.</p>
<p>你必须学习人类向生命大社区的迈进，以及当今世界存在于人类自由的巨大威胁，这些威胁来自那些来自宇宙的势力，它们来此是为了利用软弱和分裂的人类。你必须学习正在降临世界的变革巨浪：环境恶化、资源枯竭、恶劣天气、气候变化、日益加剧的经济和政治不稳定，以及战争和冲突的威胁。你来此是为了成为所有这一切的组成部分，因此你必须了解世界的状况，以及即将发生的事情，而这唯有来自上帝的启示能够提供。</p>
<p>To know who you are and why you are here, you must understand where the world stands and where it is going. You must understand your environment to know what to do in life, correctly and wisely. You are here to serve the world, so you must understand the world with a greater clarity, a greater objectivity and a greater courage. You cannot be apart and be in relationship at the same time.</p>
<p>要知道你是谁，以及你为何身处此地，你必须理解世界所处的位置和它的未来走向。你必须理解你的环境，才能知道在生命中该如何正确而明智地行事。你来此是为了服务世界，所以你必须以更清晰的视野、更客观的态度和更大的勇气去理解这个世界。你无法同时保持分离和联系。</p>
<p>Knowledge will bring you into a greater association with life and with the world and with yourself. But you must take the Steps to Knowledge, and you must bring your life in order, and you must prepare yourself for a greater engagement with the world, for this is why you have come. And it is this that you will reflect upon once you leave this world.</p>
<p>内识将带你进入与生命、与世界、与你自己的一种更伟大关联。但你必须开展内识进阶，你必须让你的生命井然有序，你必须让你自己为与世界的一种更伟大参与进行准备，因为这就是你来此的原因。一旦你离开这个世界，你将反思的正是这一点。</p>
<p>The power and the presence of Knowledge is with you. It has always been with you. You must begin now to feel its deeper current, to recognize its signs, to respond to its encouragements and its restraints, to give over your ideas and your beliefs to serve a greater power that lives within you in this moment and which will carry you forth into the great and uncertain times ahead.</p>
<p>内识的力量和存在与你同在。它始终与你同在。你必须现在开始感受它更深层次的潮流，认知它的迹象，回应它的鼓励和限制，放弃你的想法和你的信念，去服务此刻活在你内在的一个更伟大力量，它将引领你走向前方伟大而不确定的时代。</p>
