<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on September 4, 2008 in Rocky Mountain Park, Colorado<br>2008 年 9 月 4 日，在科罗拉多州落基山公园(Rocky Mountain Park, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While people abhor violence, and condemn violence, and seek ultimate punishment for those who are engaged in certain kinds of violence, they often fail to see the degree of potential violence within themselves.</p>
<p>虽然人们憎恶暴力、谴责暴力，并寻求对从事某些暴力行为的人进行最终的惩罚，但他们往往看不到他们自己身上潜在的暴力程度。</p>
<p>People love to watch violent movies, or pay close attention to catastrophes or battles or wars, as if they have an appetite and a thirst for violence. You see this all around you. It is not a mystery.</p>
<p>人们喜欢看暴力电影，或者密切关注灾难、战斗或战争，仿佛他们对暴力有着强烈的欲望。这种现象在你身边随处可见。它并不神秘。</p>
<p>Look at the movies that people watch. Look at what is portrayed in the news media. Look at what fascinates people’s imaginations. As long as there seems to be justice in violence, violence is often condoned. If violence appears to be unjust, it is condemned. But what about the violence within the person, within the people who are engaged in violent activities? What about the violence within you?</p>
<p>看看人们观看的电影。看看新闻媒体是如何描述的。看看是什么激发了人们的想象力。只要暴力看似正义，暴力往往就会被宽恕。如果暴力显得不公正，它就会受到谴责。但是，那些从事暴力活动的人，他们内心的暴力又如何呢？你内心的暴力又如何呢？</p>
<p>To seek gratification or stimulation by observing the suffering of others means that you have a tendency within yourself, an appetite within yourself, that must be satisfied through these things. You might think that violence is terrible. It might be abhorrent. You cannot even speak of it perhaps. But there is something within you that has the potential for violence and may already be violent.</p>
<p>通过观察他人的痛苦来寻求满足或刺激，意味着你内心有一种倾向，一种渴望，必须通过这些事情来满足。你或许认为暴力可怕，令人憎恶，甚至可能不愿提及。但你内心深处有某种东西，它拥有暴力的潜能，甚至可能已经暴力了。</p>
<p>What is condemnation but controlled violence? What is admonishing others but a controlled violence? What is the rejection of other peoples and nations but a controlled violence? If your mind is turbulent, if it is restless, if it is agitated, if it is filled with anxiety and resentment, then it is a well for many things, including violence.</p>
<p>谴责不就是可控的暴力吗？劝诫他人不就是可控的暴力吗？拒绝其他民族和国家不就是可控的暴力吗？如果你的心灵动荡不安，焦躁不安，焦虑不安，充满焦虑和怨恨，那么它就是许多事物的源泉，包括暴力。</p>
<p>In facing the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world, which will create great pressure on people and great difficulty, even in the wealthy nations, the veneer of civility will wash away, revealing the deeper and more genuine state of people at this time.</p>
<p>面对即将席卷世界的变革巨浪，这将给人们带来巨大的压力和困难，即使在富裕的国家，文明的虚饰也将被洗去，露出人们此时更深层次、更真实的状态。</p>
<p>People who are cultured and polite will become angry and vengeful. People who seem sophisticated will act like animals. The Great Waves of change­— which will bring violent weather, the depletion of resources, increasing economic and political instability and the growing risk of conflict and war—the darkening of the world, will push people over the edge.</p>
<p>有教养、有礼貌的人会变得愤怒和复仇。看似世故的人会像野兽一样行事。变革的巨浪——它将带来恶劣的天气、资源的枯竭、日益加剧的经济和政治不稳定，以及日益增长的冲突和战争风险——世界将变得黑暗，这些都将把人们推向崩溃的边缘。</p>
<p>They cannot be tolerant any further because they are losing their jobs. They are losing their homes. They are losing their social and political power. They are facing ever greater uncertainty. Vast networks of corruption will be revealed. Human incompetence will come to the surface in governments, religions and commerce.</p>
<p>他们无法再容忍下去，因为他们正在失去工作。他们正在失去家园。他们正在失去社会和政治权力。他们面临着越来越大的不确定性。庞大的腐败网络将被揭露。人类的无能将在政府、宗教和商业领域暴露无遗。</p>
<p>People will be enraged. They will be frustrated. They will be very frightened. Tolerance will melt away like ice in the sun, and the potential for violence—not only between nations but between people, between groups of people—will escalate, requiring more government control and suppression of personal freedom.</p>
<p>人们会愤怒，会沮丧，会极度恐惧。宽容会像阳光下的冰块一样融化，暴力的可能性——不仅是国家之间，而且是人与人之间、群体与群体之间——将会升级，需要政府加强控制，压制个人自由。</p>
<p>What can you do about this? If you really believe in peace, then you must address the potential of conflict and the reality of violence within yourself. You cannot demand peace of other people, peaceful behavior or peaceful attitudes, if you yourself cannot demonstrate this in your relationships with others, in your relationship with yourself, and in your relationship with your nation and your government and the world at large.</p>
<p>你能做什么呢？如果你真的相信和平，那么你必须正视你自己内在冲突的潜在性和暴力的现实。如果你自己无法在你与他人的关系中、在你与你自己的关系中、在你与你的国家、你的政府以及整个世界的关系中展现这些，你就无法要求他人拥有和平、和平的行为或和平的态度。</p>
<p>People demand peace, but they are not peaceful. They want peace so they can continue to engage in their personal pursuits without anyone else needing anything from them, without having their goals and plans interrupted or interfered with. It is as if they are saying: “I want peace so the world will not bother me, so I can continue my personal obsessions, my personal pursuits, without anything getting in the way.”</p>
<p>人们渴望和平，却无法真正平静。他们想要和平，是为了能够继续追求个人目标，不受他人任何干扰，不受任何目标和计划的干扰。他们仿佛在说：“我想要和平，是为了不让世界打扰我，让我能够继续我的个人执念，我的个人追求，不受任何阻碍。”</p>
<p>And when people have relative peace, they do not know what to do with themselves. They become addicted to things. They race around like a mad person. They cannot sit still for five minutes. They require constant stimulation. Their mind is full of nervousness and agitation. They do not have any real deeper sense of themselves or where their life is going.</p>
<p>当人们相对和平时，他们不知道该做什么。他们会对各种事物上瘾。他们像疯子一样四处奔波。他们连五分钟都坐不住。他们需要持续不断的刺激。他们的心灵充满了紧张和焦虑。他们对他们自己没有任何真正更深层次的感觉，也不知道他们的生命方向在哪里。</p>
<p>Look at the decay of people’s ethics and behavior in an environment of relative peacefulness. One could say people do better in war than they do in peace. They are more selfless. They are more giving. They tend to be more compassionate in certain situations. But of course war is destructive, and it sows the seeds of conflict for the future, so you cannot find purpose in war. For that is not the purpose that you came into the world with. If it takes war to have you rise to a greater occasion, to recognize greater needs, to become more selfless in your approach to the world, that is unfortunate and a sad testament.</p>
<p>看看在相对和平的环境中，人们的道德和行为是如何衰败的。有人可能会说，战争时期的人们比和平时期表现得更好。他们更加无私，更加乐于奉献，在某些情况下往往更富有同情心。但战争当然具有破坏性，它会为未来播下冲突的种子，所以你无法在战争中找到意义。因为那并非你来到这个世界的初衷。如果需要战争才能让你挺身而出，去面对更伟大的场合，去认识到更伟大的需求，去更加无私地对待世界，那将是不幸的，也是令人悲哀的证明。</p>
<p>People want change. They want the nation to change. They want the city to change. They want the culture to change, but they do not want to change. And on top of that, they want peace. They want change. They want peace. But change is not very peaceful. When people are facing real change, it is disturbing. It is an upheaval. It is stressful. It is difficult. It is uncertain.</p>
<p>人们渴望改变。他们希望国家改变。他们希望城市改变。他们希望文化改变，但他们却不愿改变。最重要的是，他们渴望和平。他们渴望改变。他们渴望和平。但改变并非那么和平。当人们面对真正的改变时，它令人不安。它如同剧变。它充满压力。它充满困难。它充满不确定性。</p>
<p>Have you ever gone through any kind of real change in your life in a state of equanimity? Of course not, not if you are honest with yourself. It was difficult. You were resistant. You struggled. You were angry. You were frustrated. You blamed other people. You blamed yourself. You fought the change. You denied the change. You put it off. Now tell the truth to yourself here. Was this a peaceful experience?</p>
<p>你曾经在平和的状态下经历过人生中任何真正的改变吗？当然没有，如果你对你自己诚实的话。那很艰难。你抗拒。你挣扎。你愤怒。你沮丧。你责怪他人。你责怪你自己。你抗拒改变。你否认改变。你拖延改变。现在，坦诚地告诉你自己。这是一种和平的体验吗？</p>
<p>How can people go through change without going through revolution, without unleashing all of their potential violence and conflict upon one another? Relative affluence has a moderating effect, but in facing the Great Waves of change, many people will be losing much if not all of their affluence, so all of these moderating effects will be removed.</p>
<p>人们如何才能在不经历改变、不将他们所有潜在的暴力和冲突释放到彼此身上的情况下经历改变？相对富裕具有缓和作用，但在面对变革巨浪时，许多人将失去大部分，甚至全部的富裕，因此所有这些缓和作用都将被消除。</p>
<p>Yes, people will be changing. They will be forced to change. They will be changing against their preference and their will. They will fight and they will struggle. And they will blame and they will condemn. That is what real change brings out in people, even if that real change has a valuable and necessary outcome.</p>
<p>是的，人们会改变。他们会被迫改变。他们会违背他们的意愿和喜好去改变。他们会抗争，他们会挣扎。他们会责怪，他们会谴责。真正的改变会给人们带来这些改变，即使这种改变最终会得到宝贵而必要的结果。</p>
<p>What would happen if you lost your job and your home? Would you be peaceful around that, particularly if you had no control over the circumstance, if it was just pulled out from under you? Would you take that in stride with a passive attitude?</p>
<p>如果你失去了工作和家，会发生什么？你会平静地面对这一切吗？尤其是在你完全无法掌控的局面，一切都突然从你身边溜走的情况下？你会以消极的态度来应对吗？</p>
<p>Even if you instigated the change based upon the movement of a deeper Knowledge within yourself, you would still go through the upheaval and the upset and the self-doubt and the frustration and the anxiety that that change would produce.</p>
<p>即使你基于你自己内在更深层次内识的运动而引发的改变，你仍然会经历这种改变所带来的动荡、不安、自我怀疑、挫折和焦虑。</p>
<p>So do not demand great change and at the same time expect peaceful relations. If you have to change your relationship with someone, and you realize you cannot go forward in a relationship with someone, would that be peaceful and elegant? No, not if you have a deep attachment to one another, or one of you has a deep attachment to the other. It would be really difficult, painful, upsetting.</p>
<p>所以，不要一边要求伟大的改变，一边又期待和平的关系。如果你必须改变与某人的关系，而你意识到你们无法继续发展下去，这还能算得上是和平优雅的吗？不，如果你们彼此深爱着对方，或者你们其中一人深爱着对方，那岂不是太难了。它实际上会非常困难、痛苦，令人心烦意乱。</p>
<p>If you are the person leaving, you will feel guilt and shame and uncertainty and great doubt. If you are the person being left, you will feel abandoned and cheated, manipulated perhaps, used, abused and so forth. That is change.</p>
<p>如果你是离开的那个人，你会感到内疚、羞愧、不确定和深深的怀疑。如果你是被留下的那个人，你会感到被抛弃、被欺骗，甚至被操纵、被利用、被虐待等等。这就是改变。</p>
<p>That is why most people talk about change, but do not change. They want other people to change. They are afraid of change. And one of the things they are afraid of is a fear of themselves—what would come to the surface in their own minds?</p>
<p>这就是为什么大多数人嘴上说着改变，却什么也没做。他们希望其他人改变。他们害怕改变。而他们害怕的事情之一，就是害怕他们自己——他们自身的心灵中会浮现出的内识？</p>
<p>One of the reasons that people do not change things that they know they must change is the self-recrimination that comes with realizing that you should have made this change years ago, and what on earth have you been doing all these years, compromising yourself in a situation that you should have resolved years ago? This self-recrimination can be very strong, and it is one of the factors that keeps people from taking action regarding change that they know they must make in their relationships and circumstances.</p>
<p>人们明知必须改变的事情却不去改变，其中一个原因就是自责，因为他们意识到他们早在几年前就应该做出改变，而这些年他们究竟在做什么，在本该在几年前就解决的问题上妥协，最终导致自责不已。这种自责感可能非常强烈，也是阻碍人们采取行动改变人际关系和处境的因素之一。</p>
<p>Many people in the face of this simply capitulate and go back into their compromised state where they will not feel what they feel. They will not know what they know. They will just try to make the best of the situation. Perhaps they will be philosophical regarding it and say, “Well, wherever God wants me to be, I will be,” as if God is the source of their problems. Or they will try to make a situation that is not working look better than it is by highlighting its benefits and its potentials and so forth.</p>
<p>许多人面对这种情况，干脆屈服，回到妥协的状态，感觉不到他们的感受。他们不知道他们知道的事情。他们只会尽力利用现状。或许他们会以一种哲学的方式看待它，说：“好吧，上帝希望我去哪里，我就去哪里”，仿佛上帝就是他们问题的根源。又或许他们会试图通过强调现状的好处和潜力等等，来让行不通的现状看起来比实际情况更好。</p>
<p>These are all forms of self-deception, of course, but one of the reasons that people take this form of action, which is not in their best interests, is to avoid dealing with what they will feel within themselves. They are afraid of their own feelings. Having never really built a deep relationship with themselves, now they are afraid of what is inside of them—afraid of anger, afraid of grief, afraid of feeling out of control. And this, of course, is the source of much mental illness and human incapacity.</p>
<p>当然，这些都是自欺欺人的形式，但人们采取这种不利于他们利益的行为的原因之一，是为了逃避处理他们自己内心的感受。他们害怕他们自身的感受。由于从未真正与他们自己建立起一种深厚的关系，他们现在害怕的是内心深处的东西——害怕愤怒，害怕悲伤，害怕失控。而这，当然是许多心理疾病和人类无能为力的根源。</p>
<p>So what should you do? It is important within yourself to build a connection to the deeper Intelligence within you. For despite however much fear and resentment and uncertainty you may be holding within yourself, this deeper foundation of Knowledge, this deeper Intelligence that God has created within you, is certain. It is uncompromised and uncompromising.</p>
<p>那么你应该怎么做呢？重要的是，在你自己的内心建立起与你内在更深层次智能的联接。因为，无论你内心可能抱有多么恐惧、怨恨和不确定，这个更深层次内识的基础，这个上帝在你内在创造的更深层次的智能，都是确定的。它是毫不妥协的，也不容妥协。</p>
<p>It knows who you are, where you need to go, what you need to do, what you need to avoid and what you must seek. It is waiting to be discovered within you. And as you take the many steps that will be necessary to approach this greater Intelligence and to build a conscious connection with it, you will lessen the impact of fear, anger, and violence within yourself.</p>
<p>它知道你是谁，你需要去哪里，你需要做什么，你需要避免什么，以及你必须寻求什么。它正等待着你内在的发现。当你迈出诸多必要的步伐，去接近这更伟大的智慧，并与它建立起一种有意识的连接时，你内在的恐惧、愤怒和暴力的影响将会逐渐减弱。</p>
<p>In a civilized state, people’s more dangerous tendencies are held in check. Through social structures, through civil expectations, through even a moderate degree of affluence; through retribution or through facing the consequences of failure, through the threat of imprisonment or social rejection, people’s more dangerous tendencies are held in check.</p>
<p>在文明国家，人们更危险的倾向受到抑制。通过社会结构，通过公民期望，通过哪怕是适度的富裕；通过惩罚或面对失败的后果，通过监禁或社会排斥的威胁，人们更危险的倾向都受到了抑制。</p>
<p>So here civilization has a moderating effect overall even if the civilization is full of difficulties. But the real problem of violence within yourself is not being resolved, even if its outward manifestations are held in check. It is still there to haunt you. It is still there to endanger you, to lead you to self-destructive behaviors, and to make terrible mistakes in your life. How do you resolve this within yourself?</p>
<p>所以，即使文明本身充满困难，它总体上也起到了缓和作用。但你内心的暴力问题并没有得到解决，即使它的外在表现得到了控制。它仍然在那里困扰着你。它仍然在那里危害你，引导你做出自我毁灭的行为，并在你的生命中犯下可怕的错误。你该如何解决你自己内心的这个问题？</p>
<p>If you fight evil, it becomes stronger. Evil loves attention. It thrives on attention. It is really something that is unreal in itself, but as more attention is given to it, and the more it is rejected and resisted, which is another form of attention, then it remains strong, and it has a powerful potentiality, a powerful potential. If you fight evil within yourself, you will not be successful because you are feeding it as you fight it.</p>
<p>如果你与邪恶抗争，它就会变得更加强大。邪恶喜欢关注。它因关注而蓬勃发展。它本身其实是不真实的，但随着人们给予它越多的关注，它被拒绝和抵制得越多——这其实是关注的另一种形式——它就会变得更加强大，拥有强大的潜能，一种强大的潜能。如果你与你内心的邪恶抗争，你不会成功，因为你在抗争的同时也在滋养它。</p>
<p>What is important is to make it unnecessary. For what is the potential for violence within yourself but a well of fear and uncertainty that you have as a result of being separated from your greater Source.</p>
<p>重要的是让它变得不必要。因为你内心潜在的暴力，不过是你与更伟大的本源分离后产生的恐惧和不确定性的深渊。</p>
<p>Here you are, alone in the world—you are supposed to create your own reality and make your own way, make your own decisions, struggle to stay above water, avoid numerous and even unexpected dangers, try to get along with other people who are not necessarily supportive of you, and may even oppose you.</p>
<p>你在这里，独自一人在这个世界上——你应该创造你自己的现实，走你自己的路，做出你自己的决定，努力维持生计，避免无数甚至意想不到的危险，尝试与不一定支持你甚至可能反对你的人相处。</p>
<p>You are in this situation without the strength and the power that God has placed within you, in the deeper Knowledge within you. As a result, you are aggressive, or you are submissive; you are hateful but pretend to be loving; you are full of uncertainty and conflict; you are aggravated by innumerable things, and if life takes away too many of your advantages, you become violent and dangerous; you engage in self-destructive behaviors; you admonish and reject other people.</p>
<p>你处于这种境况中，缺乏上帝赋予你内在的力量和实力，缺乏上帝赋予你内在更深层次内识的力量和实力。结果，你充满侵略性，或者你顺从；你充满仇恨却假装爱；你充满不确定性和冲突；你被无数事物激怒，如果生活夺走了你太多的优势，你就会变得暴力和危险；你陷入自我毁灭的行为；你训斥和排斥他人。</p>
<p>You are just like what you see in the world today, underneath whatever the pretense that people are putting forward. You have all of this pathology within yourself, even if you appear to the outside to be very much in control, and very smooth, claiming to be aware and spiritual and enlightened. That pathology is still there.</p>
<p>你就像你今天在世上所看到的那些人一样，无论人们如何伪装，你自己的内心都充满了病态，即使你表面上看起来控制欲十足，行事圆滑，自称拥有警觉、精神和开悟。但那病态依然存在。</p>
<p>How will you undo it? How will you weaken it so it does not cast a pervasive, everlasting cloud over your life and influence your decisions, and spoil your relationships, and ruin your ability to enjoy life in the moment and to prepare wisely for the future?</p>
<p>你要如何消除它？你要如何削弱它，让它不再成为你生命中挥之不去的阴云，不再影响你的决定，不再破坏你的人际关系，不再毁掉你享受当下、明智地规划未来的能力？</p>
<p>Certainly, you will have to make decisions regarding certain kinds of behaviors. And you will recognize, if you give this your attention, that there are certain procedures and methodologies for replacing self-destructive behaviors with behaviors that are constructive for you and for other people. You will perhaps find very powerful methodologies that can help you.</p>
<p>当然，你必须针对某些行为做出决定。如果你关注这一点，你就会意识到，有一些程序和方法可以用对你和他人都有益的行为取代自我毁灭的行为。你或许会找到非常有效的方法来帮助自己。</p>
<p>Perhaps you will find a very competent teacher or set of teachers that can assist you in rehabilitating your life, and in giving it greater strength and balance. Perhaps you will turn to religion and believe that your worshipping of God will give you strength and that God will infuse you with blessings and purity.</p>
<p>也许你会找到一位或几位非常称职的老师，帮助你重塑人生，赋予生命更大的力量和平衡。也许你会皈依宗教，相信对上帝的崇拜会赋予你力量，相信上帝会给你带来祝福和纯洁。</p>
<p>But the question arises: What will give you the power to overcome the potential for evil within yourself? Not only to hold it in check, but to weaken it significantly to the point where it cannot govern you even if you are facing deprivation and difficult circumstances?</p>
<p>但问题来了：什么能赋予你力量，让你克服内心潜在的邪恶？不仅能抑制它，还能大大削弱它，使它即使在你面临匮乏和困境时也无法控制你？</p>
<p>People think the methodology alone is enough: “I have found this wonderful teaching. It has a practice. I will practice it. It has a methodology. I will use it.” But they soon find out they really do not have the strength to implement it and to consistently apply it. Perhaps their ship has sails, but there is no wind. There is no power within them to move them forward.</p>
<p>人们认为只要有方法论就足够了：“我发现了这个奇妙的教导。它有实践方法。我要去实践它。它有方法论。我要去运用它。”但他们很快发现他们真的没有力量去实践它，并始终如一地运用它。也许他们的船有帆，但没有风。他们内心没有力量推动他们前进。</p>
<p>That is why at the source of all of this, even if you engage in very healthful activities and establish a more positive attitude, you must still find the power of Knowledge within yourself. For only it has the strength and the conviction and the commitment to break the chains that hold you, and to deflate the potential for evil and violence, to release you from constant aggravation and a feeling of constant inner restraint.</p>
<p>正因为如此，在所有这一切的根源处，即使你从事非常健康的活动并建立一种更积极的态度，你仍然必须找到你内在内识的力量。因为只有它拥有力量、信念和承诺，能够打破束缚你的枷锁，能够消除邪恶和暴力的潜在性，能够将你从持续的恼怒和持续的内在束缚感中解放出来。</p>
<p>If people do not find this source of power and guidance within themselves, then they are relying upon their will power alone, and for most people this will not be sufficient. A few will be able to overcome their obstacles and build a new foundation for themselves, but even this foundation will not really be successful in facing the Great Waves of change. You must have the power that God has placed within you to do this.</p>
<p>如果人们没有在他们自己内在找到这种力量和指引的源泉，那么他们就只能依靠他们的意志力，而对大多数人来说，这还不够。少数人能够克服他们的障碍，为他们构建一个新的基础，但即使是这样的基础，也无法真正成功地应对变革的巨浪。你必须拥有上帝赋予你内在的力量才能做到这一点。</p>
<p>Do not think that by the sheer force of your personality that you can break the chains that bind you, that you can lift yourself up. You will need all of your strength to undergo real and constructive change in your life, but you will need the power of Knowledge to fuel your actions.</p>
<p>不要认为仅凭你人性的驱动力就能打破束缚你的枷锁，就能提升你。你需要你所有的力量来经历你生命中真正的、建设性的改变，但你需要内识的力量来驱动你的行动。</p>
<p>Do not fall into the trap of thinking that you have to do everything, or you just sit around and God does everything, as if Grace takes care of all of these problems—fixes your leaky roof, fixes your broken relationship, fixes your compromised and neglected health, and can enable you to overcome your fixations or obsessions and addictions.</p>
<p>不要陷入这样的思维陷阱：你必须做所有的事情，或者你只要坐在那里，上帝就会做所有的事情，就好像上帝的恩典会解决所有这些问题——修好你漏水的屋顶，修复你破裂的关系，修复你受损和被忽视的健康，并能让你克服你的执念、痴迷和上瘾。</p>
<p>It will take the strength of your will, your personality, your physical strength, your personal determination, with the power of Knowledge to break the chains that chain you to the wall, that keep your mind in a state of constant aggravation, that breaks addiction and obsession.</p>
<p>你需要用你的意志力、你的人性、你的体力、你的个人决心，以及内识的力量来打破将你束缚在墙上的锁链，打破让你的心灵处于不断恼怒状态的锁链，打破成瘾和痴迷。</p>
<p>For Knowledge is not addicted. It is not obsessed. It is not angry. It is not violent. When you see the difference through experience between the reality of Knowledge and the state of your personal mind, you will see very clearly the great difference. And you will see who must be the master and who must be the servant. You will see where the source of strength is within yourself, and you will see the weak condition of your mind and the compromised state of your life.</p>
<p>因为内识不上瘾。它不痴迷。它不愤怒。它不暴力。当你通过体验看到内识的现实和你个人心灵状态之间的差异时，你将非常清晰地看到那巨大的差异。你将看到谁必须是主人，谁必须是仆人。你将看到你内在的力量源泉在哪里，你将看到你心灵的脆弱状态和你生命的妥协状态。</p>
<p>Do not think that you are where you are in life is where God wants you to be. That is so very rare. You have a mountain to climb. You have movement to make within yourself and in the world around you.</p>
<p>不要认为你现在的生命状态就是上帝希望你达到的状态。这种情况非常罕见。你还有一座山要攀登。你还有内心和周围的世界要行动。</p>
<p>Most people are not where they need to be. They have fallen asleep on the side of the road, or have built mansions for themselves on the lower slopes of the mountain. And now they are trying to be happy, comfortable, and fulfilled there. But everyone has a mountain to climb to find their real gifts, their real contribution to a world in need.</p>
<p>大多数人都未能到达他们该去的地方。他们睡在路边，或在山坡下为他们自己建造豪宅。如今，他们正努力在那里寻求快乐、舒适和满足。但每个人都有一座山需要攀登，才能发现自己他们的礼物，才能为这个需要帮助的世界做出真正的贡献。</p>
<p>Rich and poor, people are held back. The poor are held back circumstantially to a very great degree, but so are the rich in a very different way. It is more tragic with the rich because they are more deluded. They are more prone to fantasy about themselves. They have more addictions to break, more fixations to escape, more delusions to retreat from. They are less honest than the poor and less aware of the realities of life.</p>
<p>无论贫富，人们都会受到阻碍。穷人在很大程度上受到环境因素的阻碍，而富人则以截然不同的方式受到阻碍。富人的情况更为悲惨，因为他们更容易被迷惑。他们更容易对他们自己抱有幻想。他们有更多成瘾需要戒除，更多执念需要摆脱，更多妄想需要摆脱。他们不如穷人诚实，对生命的现实也缺乏察觉。</p>
<p>When the rich get angry, the country goes to war. If enough poor become angry, well, then you might have revolution, but revolution is costly and destructive and rarely achieves its stated goals, replacing one set of overlords with another.</p>
<p>富人愤怒，国家就会开战。如果足够多的穷人愤怒，那么也许就会爆发革命，但革命代价高昂，破坏性极强，而且很少能实现其既定目标，只会用一代霸主取代另一代霸主。</p>
<p>Your task is to take the Steps to Knowledge. Then whatever you do that is beneficial will be empowered by the presence of Knowledge, and whatever you try to do that is not beneficial will be restrained by the power and the presence of Knowledge.</p>
<p>你的任务是开展内识进阶。这样，你所做的一切有益之事，都将因内识的存在而获得力量；你试图做的一切无益之事，都将因内识的力量和存在而受到约束。</p>
<p>God is not going to swoop down and wash away all your sins, as an immense act of Grace. God is not going to dispel your illusions and your fantasies, your addictions and your tragedies. God has placed a perfect guiding intelligence within you. Without it, you are lost. Rich or poor, you are lost.</p>
<p>上帝不会像施恩般俯冲下来，洗去你所有的罪孽。上帝不会驱散你的幻觉、你的妄想、你的沉迷和你的悲剧。上帝已经将完美的指引智能置于你的内心。没有它，你就会迷失。无论贫富，你都会迷失。</p>
<p>Your life is empty, whether it be filled with pleasure and attachments and possessions, or whether it is bereft of these things. You are swayed by the world. You are swayed by your passions. You have no control over yourself that is real and genuine. You are addicted to power or to pleasure or to persuasions of one kind or another. You are impoverished at the level of your soul.</p>
<p>你的生命是空的，无论它充满着快乐、执着和物质，还是一无所有。你被世俗所左右，被你的激情所左右。你无法真正地掌控你自己。你沉迷于权力、享乐，或各种各样的诱惑。你在灵魂的层面上是贫瘠的。</p>
<p>That is why while there is much effort that must be made on behalf of humanity, and there must be much effort exerted for the redemption of each individual and for the correction of humanity’s great mistakes; and while there must be tremendous cooperation in preparing for the Great Waves of change that are already striking the world in so many places, at the core, you must have a foundation in Knowledge and be grounded in Knowledge.</p>
<p>正因为如此，尽管为了人类必须付出巨大努力，尽管为了救赎每个个体、纠正人类的重大错误必须付出巨大努力；尽管为了应对已在世界许多地方冲击的变革巨浪必须进行极大合作，但从核心上讲，你必须拥有内识的基础，并扎根于内识。</p>
<p>This is not the same as spending 30 years in meditation trying to be enlightened. For Knowledge will guide you in the world. It will weaken your attachments. It will undo your dilemmas slowly, but deeply. As you become closer to Knowledge, it exerts a greater influence over you, and you begin to settle down into your deeper nature.</p>
<p>这不同于花费30年时间冥想以期获得开悟。因为内识将在世间指引你。它将削弱你的执着。它将缓慢而深刻地化解你的困境。当你越来越接近内识时，它会对你施加更强大的影响，你也会开始安顿下来，融入你更深层次的自然。</p>
<p>You are faced with decisions. Your mind wants something that Knowledge does not want, and you will have to face this conflict, this dilemma. You want a person, a place, or a thing. Knowledge is not going there, and you cannot make a deal. There is no making deals with Knowledge. It has no interest [there].</p>
<p>你面临着抉择。你的心灵想要某种内识不想要的东西，你将不得不面对这种冲突，这种困境。你想要一个人，一个地方，或一件东西。内识不会去那里，你也无法达成交易。你无法与内识达成交易。它对那里不感兴趣。</p>
<p>Do you see here? If you choose with Knowledge, you are defying your passions, your obsessions, your fantasies. You are choosing something else. You will not be certain in your choice. You will be full of doubt perhaps, and you might even feel a great sense of loss that you are not going to have this desired person, this place or this thing, whatever it might be. But you have given strength to Knowledge.</p>
<p>在这里，你看到了吗？如果你带着内识去选择，你就是在对抗你的激情、你的执念、你的空想。你在选择别的东西。你将无法确定你的选择。你或许会充满怀疑，你甚至可能感到巨大的失落，因为你将无法拥有这个渴望的人、这个地方或这个东西，无论它是什么。但你赋予了内识力量。</p>
<p>Because, you see, only God knows how to redeem you. You do not know. You cannot do it on your own. You cannot lift yourself up off the ground. Here you must learn to receive and to choose, and to honor your choice, and to bring your personal power to bear to follow the right choice that you make with Knowledge. If Knowledge is not going for this person, this place or this thing, you should not be going there either.</p>
<p>因为，你看，唯有上帝知道如何救赎你。你不知道。你无法独自做到。你无法让你自己从地面上站起来。在这里，你必须学习接收和选择，尊重你的选择，并运用你的个人力量去遵循你凭借内识做出的正确选择。如果内识不去往这个人、这个地方或这个事物，你也不应该去那里。</p>
<p>For Knowledge is trying to take you somewhere in life. It is trying to take you to a set of circumstances, and to meet certain people, and to have certain experiences and realizations that will begin to reveal to you your greater purpose for coming into the world, which is barely reflected currently in what you think and in what you do.</p>
<p>因为内识正试图带你去往生命中的某个地方。它正试图带你去体验一系列境遇，去遇见特定的人，去获得某些体验和领悟，这些将开始向你揭示你来到这个世界的更伟大目的，而这在目前你的所思所为中几乎没有得到体现。</p>
<p>That is why the New Message Teaching that God has sent into the world provides the Steps to Knowledge as a part of its essential teaching. While many things are directed and recommended for successful and harmonious living in a changing world, there must be this fundamental connection at the center of it all: as if this were the hub of the wheel, and that everything you do radiates out of this hub and is influenced by this hub—who you are with, the work that you do, how you view the world, how you respond to difficulties and failure, how you face change, the degree to which you have the strength and the wisdom to make positive change in your life. All of this power emanates from Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>正因为如此，上帝发送给世界的新讯息教导将内识进阶作为其核心教导的一部分。虽然许多事情被指引和推荐，以便在一个变化的世界中成功和谐地生活，但这一切的中心必须存在着这种根本性的连接：仿佛这是车轮的轮毂，你所做的一切都从这个轮毂辐射出去，并受到这个轮毂的影响——你和谁在一起，你做的工作，你如何看待世界，你如何应对困难和失败，你如何面对变化，你拥有多大程度的力量和智慧来在你的生命中做出积极的改变。所有这些力量都源自你内在的内识。</p>
<p>Without this, you are weak and, in most cases, do not have the strength to overcome the real obstacles that are affecting you. God knows you cannot do this alone, so God has given you Knowledge. God knows that without Knowledge, you would try perhaps very hard, but you know, you would constantly be swept up by the world, constantly overtaken by this force or that force, this emotion or that emotion, this reaction or that reaction.</p>
<p>没有这些，你是软弱的，在大多数情况下，你没有力量去克服那些影响你的真正障碍。上帝知道你无法独自做到这一点，所以上帝赋予了你内识。上帝知道，如果没有内识，你或许会非常努力，但你知道，你会不断地被世界席卷，不断地被这种力量或那种力量、这种情绪或那种情绪、这种反应或那种反应所超越。</p>
<p>The world is full of these persuasions—social movements, political movements, personal anguish, control of your family, social obligations, religious edicts. Everything is pulling on you from the outside. Where are you going to find your real connection to God and the strength that God has given you? That, in and of itself, with your awareness and your cooperation, will undo the seeds of conflict within you.</p>
<p>这个世界充满了这些观念——社会运动、政治运动、个人痛苦、家庭控制、社会义务、宗教法令。一切都在从外部牵引着你。你该去哪里找到你与上帝的真正连接，以及上帝赋予你的力量？而这本身，加上你的觉知和你的合作，就能化解你内心冲突的种子。</p>
<p>You will still have emotions and feelings, sure. You will still get bothered by things, certainly. You are not going to be dead. You will still be affected by the world. You will feel tragedy. You will be upset by violence. You will be disturbed by the suffering of people. You will be annoyed by people’s stupidity and cruelty, but the difference is that all of these reactions and emotions will not change the course of your life, which now has a greater power directing it.</p>
<p>你仍然会有情绪和感受，这是肯定的。你仍然会被一些事情困扰，这是肯定的。你不会死。你仍然会被这个世界影响。你会感受到悲剧。你会被暴力所困扰。你会被人们的苦难所困扰。你会被人们的愚蠢和残忍所恼怒，但不同的是，所有这些反应和情绪都不会改变你的生命轨迹，你的生命现在拥有一种更伟大的力量在指引它。</p>
<p>But you must be very patient, you see. This is part of what undoes your restlessness, your aggravation, your irritability. It is because the journey is slow. You want the journey to happen now. You want the results now, as if you were purchasing something from a store. You pay your money; you want to get what you want. You want strength; you want certainty; you want real direction in life. You want it now. Don’t you? Oh, tell the truth here. You want it now.</p>
<p>但你看，你必须非常有耐心。这能部分化解你的焦躁不安、恼怒和烦躁。因为旅程是缓慢的。你想要旅程现在就开始。你想要现在就得到结果，就像在商店买东西一样。你付了钱；你希望得到你想要的东西。你想要力量；你想要确定性；你想要生命的真正方向。你现在就想要。不是吗？哦，在这里告诉我真理。你现在就想要。</p>
<p>You do not want to have to work for it, but you will have to because the journey requires it, because the journey is where you gain wisdom and strength and power, where you see how Knowledge works, where you gain enough skill that you can be of service to others in the future.</p>
<p>你不想为此而努力，但你必须这样做，因为旅程需要它，因为旅程是你获得智慧、实力和力量的地方，是你看见内识如何运作的地方，是你获得足够的技能以便你将来可以为他人服务的地方。</p>
<p>People think that becoming healed or authentic in their life is a kind of dispensation from God, but really the potential for this is within them at all times. But for many people, it is like having to backtrack. They went so far off course in life that they have to find their way back because if you are lost, you have to find your way back.</p>
<p>人们认为生命中的治愈或真实是上帝的恩赐，但实际上，这种潜能一直存在于他们自身。但对许多人来说，它就像不得不回溯。他们在生命中偏离了太远的轨道，以至于他们必须找到回来的路，因为如果你迷失了方向，你就必须找到回来的路。</p>
<p>In doing so, you begin to review and recognize your former errors. You begin to undo the motivation that took you off course to begin with. You begin to recognize the mistakes you made along the way and to realize what caused them, and why you gave in to them. This is all wisdom building, you see. For the journey is not simply to get you out of trouble. It is to make you powerful and wise so that you may be of service to the world.</p>
<p>如此一来，你便开始回顾并认识到你以往的错误。你开始摒弃最初让你偏离轨道的动机。你开始认识到你一路走来所犯的错误，并意识到导致这些错误的原因，以及你为何屈服于这些错误。你看，这一切都是在积累智慧。因为这段旅程不仅仅是为了让你摆脱困境，而是为了让你变得强大和明智，从而服务于世界。</p>
<p>That is why God does not cast a wand over you and make all of your troubles go away, as if you are on welfare of some kind. You have to backtrack. Your life went off course some time back there. You have to work your way back. Just as if you were lost in a big city, or in the wilderness, well, you have to backtrack, try to figure out where you lost your point of certainty, beyond which you didn’t know where you were or what you were doing.</p>
<p>这就是为什么上帝不会像你领着某种救济金一样，对你挥动魔杖，让你所有的烦恼都消失。你必须回溯。你的生命在某个时间偏离了轨道。你必须努力回到正轨。就像你在大城市里迷路，或者在荒野中迷失，你必须回溯，努力弄清楚你在哪里失去了确定性，超越了那个确定性，你就不知道你在哪里，也不知道你在做什么。</p>
<p>It is here that you realize your mistakes. How would you ever know how you ended up where you are today if you did not backtrack? You would not even realize where you went wrong, where you made a bad decision—in fact, not only one but many. And with each one you became more disassociated from yourself, more estranged from yourself, more caught up and lost in the world.</p>
<p>正是在这里，你意识到了你的错误。如果你不回头，又怎么会知道你如今的处境？你甚至意识不到你错在哪里，哪里做了错误的决定——事实上，你犯了不止一个错误，而是很多个。而每一次错误都会让你更加疏离你自己，更加疏远你自己，更加被这个世界所困，迷失自我。</p>
<p>People do not end up where they are by accident, you see. There are decisions and circumstances. So there is a certain amount of backtracking here that must take place. But while you are backtracking, you are also building wisdom and clarity and strength.</p>
<p>你看，人们并非偶然走到今天这一步。这其中有各种决定和境遇。所以，这里必然存在一定程度的回溯。但当你回溯时，你也在积累智慧、辨别力和实力。</p>
<p>Most people, you see, do not want to backtrack. They want to keep on going from where they are. They want to now become enlightened or powerful or successful. They want to heal their relationships or resolve their emotional difficulties right where they are, but they are lost. They do not want to have to go back and see where they were and do a review of their life in a very conscious way. They just want to have certainty where they are. But they lost their certainty some time ago, and they do not know when, where and how they lost it.</p>
<p>你看，大多数人都不想回头。他们想继续从现状出发。他们想现在就变得开悟、强大或成功。他们想在现状下疗愈人际关系或解决情绪困境，但他们迷失了方向。他们不想回到过去，以非常清醒的方式回顾他们的生命。他们只想确定他们现在的处境。但他们很久以前就失去了这种确定性，他们不知道他们在何时、何地、如何失去了它。</p>
<p>These are things you must discover because you must have wisdom if you are to be of service to others. How will you know how to support the renewal of someone else’s life if you have no idea what the renewal of your life is, and what it required, and what you had to learn in the process of going through this renewal?</p>
<p>这些都是你必须发现的事情，因为你必须拥有智慧才能服务他人。如果你不知道自己生命的更新是什么、它需要什么、以及在经历这个更新的过程中你必须学习的事情，你怎么会知道如何去支持他人生命的更新呢？</p>
<p>This is very important to understand because there are many mistakes along the way, and this unwillingness to backtrack is one of them. That is why the New Message teaches you how to review your life and emphasizes this so you can see in your own experience, in your own history, where your life went off track, and what motivated you to make unwise decisions.</p>
<p>理解这一点非常重要，因为生命道路上有很多错误，而不愿回头就是其中之一。正因如此，新讯息教导你如何回顾你的生命，并强调这一点，这样你就能在你自身的经验中，在你自身的历史中，看到你的生命在哪里偏离了轨道，以及是什么促使你做出不明智的决定。</p>
<p>What were the forces within you and in your environment that encouraged you to make a wrong decision in a relationship, for example, or to commit yourself to a career that never really could fulfill you in any real way?</p>
<p>例如，你内心和周围环境中的哪些驱动力促使你在一段关系中做出错误的决定，或者让你投身于一份永远无法真正让你感到满足的职业？</p>
<p>You must recognize this within yourself and in your environment, both presently and in the past: What has held you back? You cannot guess here. You cannot just make an assumption. You must really find this out because if you do not realize what undermines you, then it will continue to undermine your forward progress.</p>
<p>你必须在你自己和周围环境中，无论是现在还是过去，认识到这一点：是什么阻碍了你？你无法猜测。你无法仅仅做出假设。你必须真正地找到答案，因为如果你不意识到是什么在阻碍你，那么它就会继续阻碍你前进。</p>
<p>If someone is lost in the wilderness and sets a path for themselves, they could become more lost. They might choose to go west when they need to go north. They do not know where they are going. They do not know what they are doing. They do not even know where they are.</p>
<p>如果有人在荒野中迷路，却为他们自己开辟了一条道路，他们可能会更加迷失。他们本该向北走，却偏偏选择向西走。他们不知道他们要去哪里，不知道他们在做什么，甚至不知道他们身在何处。</p>
<p>Even if you have to backtrack a hundred miles in the wilderness to get back to the point where you knew where you were, where you had provisions and stability, then that is what you have to do.</p>
<p>即使你必须在荒野中回溯一百英里才能回到你所知道的地方，回到你有供给和稳定的地方，那也是你必须要做的。</p>
<p>This deep evaluation of your life is so important, and it must be done with as much clarity and objectivity as possible. This self-evaluation, the evaluation of your life and history, is very significant because it will show you the evidence of Knowledge at each turning point. You will see there were signs and inclinations that you should not have done what you did.</p>
<p>对你生命的深度评估非常重要，它必须尽可能清晰客观地进行。这种自我评估，对你的生命和历史的评估，非常重要，因为它会在每个转折点向你展示内识的证据。你会看到，有一些迹象和倾向表明你不应该做你所做的事情。</p>
<p>Perhaps you felt the restraint within yourself. Perhaps someone else warned you. Perhaps you made your decision with a sense of deep resignation instead of joyful anticipation. What was that like for you? Because you need to know that when you meet the next turning point, the next fork in the road, you will know the powers that will lead you in the right direction, and the forces that will lead you in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>也许你感受到了你自己内心的束缚。也许有人警告过你。也许你做出决定时，带着深深的无奈，而非满怀喜悦的期待。你当时是什么感受？因为你需要知道，当你遇到下一个转折点，下一个岔路口时，你就会知道哪些力量会引导你走向正确的方向，哪些力量会引导你走向错误的方向。</p>
<p>If you go on without having learned this, well, you will just make the same mistake again. Perhaps it will be under different appearances, but really, perhaps you will be seduced by something else. Before, you married someone because they were handsome or beautiful. Now you are going to marry someone because they look to be spiritual, making the same mistake all over again—neglecting the signs and the symptoms that you were making the wrong decisions and forging ahead, either willfully or in a state of resignation. What can God do for you but amplify Knowledge within you?</p>
<p>如果你不学着这些就继续下去，那么，你只会再次犯同样的错误。或许它会以不同的表象出现，但实际上，或许你会被别的东西诱惑。以前，你嫁给某人是因为他们英俊或美丽。现在，你又要嫁给某人，因为他们看起来是精神的，再次犯下同样的错误——忽视你正在做出错误决定的迹象和症状，继续前进，无论是故意的还是在顺从的状态中。上帝除了放大你内在的内识之外，还能为你做什么呢？</p>
<p>The examples here are too numerous to mention, but as you begin to do a review of your life in your deep evaluation, well, you will begin to find them. Going back, where did you make the critical decisions that had to do primarily with relationships with people, with places, with forms of work? Go back to each one of those junctions. What was it like to be there? What encouraged your decision? And what, if any that you could recognize, were the signs indicating that you should have done something else?</p>
<p>这里的例子不胜枚举，但当你开始深入反思你的生命时，你就会开始发现它们。回想一下，你是在哪里做出那些主要与人际关系、地点和工作形式相关的关键决定的？回顾每一个关键时刻。当时的感受如何？是什么促使你做出了这样的决定？如果你能识别出一些迹象，那么这些迹象是否表明你本应该做些其他的事情？</p>
<p>Know these signs. Acquaint yourself with them fully. Remind yourself of them every day because those signs will be there for you in the future. And those forces that led you astray will be there in the future because the world is full of these forces.</p>
<p>知道这些迹象。充分了解它们。每天提醒你自己，因为这些迹象将来会一直存在。那些让你误入歧途的驱动力将来也会存在，因为这个世界充满了这些力。</p>
<p>Now you must guard your mind and your decisions carefully. Not bringing fear, but great caution and discernment to your engagements with people and to what attracts you. You bring everything to Knowledge. You learn to do this through taking the Steps to Knowledge. And you learn to do this because this is your primary education.</p>
<p>现在你必须谨慎守护你的心灵和你的决定。不是带着恐惧，而是带着极大的谨慎和辨识力去对待你与他人的交往，去对待吸引你的事物。你把一切都带向内识。你通过学习内识进阶来做到这一点。你学习做到这一点，因为这是你的基础教育。</p>
<p>You may praise God and worship God, but God only wants you to do what you came here to do, what you were sent here to do. You will only honor God by doing that. And if your life has gone off course, you must go back and re-examine this so that you can move forward with greater discernment, greater clarity and greater strength.</p>
<p>你可以赞美上帝，敬拜上帝，但上帝只希望你做你来此要做的事，做你被派来此要做的事。你只有这样做才能荣耀上帝。如果你的生命偏离了轨道，你必须回头重新审视，这样你才能以更敏锐的辨别力、更清晰的思路和更强大的实力继续前进。</p>
<p>Then what is restless and violent within you will become subdued. The power that reinforces it will be diminished. That power will now be exerting itself in another direction.</p>
<p>这样，你内心的躁动与狂暴就会被制服。强化它的力量也会减弱。那股力量现在将在另一个方向上发挥作用。</p>
<p>Here you will find greater strength, greater certainty and greater self-awareness. You will not be so easily seduced by the allurements of this world. You will not be so easily swayed by other people’s opinions. Wealth, beauty and charm will have less and less effect upon you, for you will be looking for something deeper in people—the very depth that you are working to find and to keep alive within yourself.</p>
<p>在这里，你将发现更伟大的力量、更伟大的确定性和更伟大的自我觉知。你将不再轻易被这个世界的诱惑所诱惑。你将不再轻易被他人的观点所左右。财富、美貌和魅力对你的影响将越来越小，因为你将在人们身上寻找一种更深层次的内识——内识正是你正在努力寻找并保持于你自己内在的深度。</p>
