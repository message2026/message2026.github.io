<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on April 21, 2000 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2000 年 4 月 21 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We would like to speak about learning and living The Way of Knowledge as a fundamental spiritual focus and practice and application in life. To begin with, let Us speak about what Knowledge is and why it is so important for you.</p>
<p>我们想谈谈学习和践行内识之路，将其作为生命中的一种基本精神焦点、精神实践和精神应用。首先，让我们谈谈内识是什么，以及它对你如此重要的原因。</p>
<p>Knowledge represents the deeper spiritual Mind within you, the Mind that knows. This deeper Mind does not think like your personal mind, or your surface mind, thinks. This deeper Mind does not deliberate. It does not compare. It does not speculate, does not fantasize, does not engage in most of the activities that your intellect is involved in.</p>
<p>内识代表着你内在更深层次的精神心灵，即知道的心灵。这种更深层次心灵的思考方式与你的个人心灵或表面的心灵不同。这种更深层次的心灵不会深思熟虑。它不会比较。它不会推测、不会幻想、不会参与你的智力所涉及的大多数活动。</p>
<p>Instead, this deeper Mind is really here on a mission. It is here because it is here to do something important for the world. And it will emerge, possibly, later in your life when you have developed yourself as a person and have gained some degree of independence and independent thinking. When this occurs, there is a chance that this deeper Mind, this Mind We call Knowledge, may begin to assert itself and to emerge within your experience.</p>
<p>相反，这种更深层次的心灵其实是肩负着使命而存在的。它之所以存在，是因为它要为世界做一些重要的事情。它可能会在你成长为一个人并获得一定程度的独立性和独立思考能力之后的生命中出现。当这种情况发生时，这个更深层次的心灵，即我们称之为内识的心灵，就有可能开始发挥它自己的作用，并出现在你的体验中。</p>
<p>The Mind of Knowledge is like no other mind. You could think about it endlessly, but your intellect can only imagine another intellect. You could speculate about what Knowledge is like, but really your speculations would still be based upon your intellect, which can only project images that it can conceive of, images of itself.</p>
<p>内识的心灵与其他的心灵不同。你可以无休止地思考它，但你的智力只能想象另一个智力。你可以推测内识是什么样的，但实际上你的推测仍然基于你的智力，它只能投射它能想到的图像，即它自己的图像。</p>
<p>This is why the deeper Mind of Knowledge seems so mysterious. It is beyond definition. You can describe its manifestations. You can describe any direct experience you may have with it, but really it is so mysterious.</p>
<p>这就是为什么更深层次的内识心灵看起来如此神秘。它无法定义。你可以描述它的表现。你可以描述你对它的任何直接体验，但它真的非常神秘。</p>
<p>Some people say: “Well, this is all the Christ Consciousness” or “This is Buddhahood” or “This is Universal Mind.” And there is a great deal of speculation on what this Mind is really like, how it functions, where it comes from and so forth. But these are all speculations from the intellect.</p>
<p>有些人会说：“好吧，这都是基督意识”或“这是佛性”或“这是宇宙之心”。人们对这种心灵到底是什么样的、它如何运作、它从何而来等等有很多猜测。但这些都是来自智力的猜测。</p>
<p>They cannot encompass the mysterious nature of Knowledge within you. Nor can they describe really how Knowledge works, how it functions, how it manifests itself, why it is here, and what it is here to serve.</p>
<p>它们无法涵盖你内在内识的神秘自然。它们也无法真正描述内识如何工作、如何运作、如何显现、为何存在以及它在此服务于什么。</p>
<p>Therefore, for you, you must allow these things to remain somewhat mysterious. It is only through direct experience with Knowledge itself that you will be able to learn what Knowledge is, how Knowledge functions, and why it is within you.</p>
<p>因此，对你来说，你必须允许这些事情保持某种神秘感。只有通过直接体验内识本身，你才能了解内识是什么、内识如何运作以及它为何存在于你的内在。</p>
<p>However, there are some very general things that We can say about Knowledge that kind of gives it a context and helps you to understand really what it is within you, and perhaps can enable you to prevent making certain mistakes in the way that you think of Knowledge or in your practice and study of The Way of Knowledge.</p>
<p>然而，我们可以就内识说一些非常普遍的事情，这些事情为内识提供了一个背景，并帮助你真正理解内识在你内心是什么，也许可以帮助你避免在你思考内识的方式上、在你实践和学习内识之路的方式上犯某些错误。</p>
<p>Knowledge, in essence, is really God within you. God has given you part of God’s consciousness. It is within you. This consciousness is not like your intellect, however. It is not constantly thinking, deliberating, planning, remembering, imagining, and so forth.</p>
<p>从本质上讲，内识其实就是你心中的上帝。上帝赋予了你上帝意识的一部分。它就在你的内心。然而，这种意识与你的智力不同。它不会不断地思考、斟酌、计划、记忆、想象等等。</p>
<p>It is really more an awareness, a state of mind. It is connected to everything in the universe. Your little piece of God contains your connection with God. It is to assure that while you are living in the world in a state of seeming Separation, you cannot really be apart from God.</p>
<p>它实际上更像是一种觉知，一种心灵状态。它与宇宙中的万事万物息息相关。你那一小块上帝之物包含着你与上帝的联接。它确保当你生活在看似分离的世界中时，你无法真正与上帝分离。</p>
<p>So Knowledge really is your God connection. This deeper part of your mind is your God connection. You cannot really connect with God through your intellect because your intellect was not created by God. It was created by you and by your environment. What was created by God is Knowledge within you, this deeper Mind that We are describing.</p>
<p>因此，内识实际上是你与上帝的联接。你心灵的这个更深层次的部分就是你与上帝的联接。你无法通过你的智力真正与上帝连接，因为你的智力不是上帝创造的。它是由你和你的环境创造的。上帝创造的是你内在的内识，也就是我们所描述的这个更深层次的心灵。</p>
<p>So for now, be content to realize Knowledge is your connection to God, it is how you can experience God most directly, and it is the part of you that really has come into the world for a mission.</p>
<p>因此现在，要满足于认识到内识是你与上帝的联接，它是你最直接体验上帝的方式，它是你真正为了使命而来到这个世界的部分。</p>
<p>In other words, Knowledge contains the memory of your Creator, the memory of your purpose for being here, and the blueprint for your mission in life. There really is a greater activity that you are here to accomplish.</p>
<p>换句话说，内识包含着你的造物主的记忆、你来到这里的目的的记忆，以及你生命使命的蓝图。你来到这里确实是为了完成一项更伟大的活动。</p>
<p>Now there are some people who say: “Oh, I know what my mission is. It is to do this or to do that.” But this is not yet Knowledge. Perhaps they are moving in the right direction. Perhaps they have learned step one or step two of the many steps that they will have to take, but your mission is not simply a definition. And only if you are very advanced in taking these steps can you say with any real certainty and honesty: “This is my mission.”</p>
<p>现在有些人会说：“哦，我知道我的使命是什么。就是做这个或做那个。”但这还不是内识。也许他们正朝着正确的方向前进。也许他们已经学会了他们必须采取的许多步骤中的第一步或第二步，但你的使命不仅仅是一个定义。只有当你在采取这些步骤方面非常先进时，你才能真正确定和诚实地说：“这是我的使命。”</p>
<p>So at the outset, do not claim what your mission is because you really do not have it yet. Even if you are moving in the right direction, you do not have it yet. You will not have your mission until you are firmly established within it; until you can experience what it is on a regular basis; until it directs your life, your activity, your relationships, your understanding, and so forth.</p>
<p>所以一开始，不要声称你的使命是什么，因为你实际上还没有。即使你正朝着正确的方向前进，你也还没有得到它。除非你坚定地立足于你的使命；除非你能定期体验它是什么；除非它指导你的生命、你的活动、你的关系、你的理解等等，否则你不会拥有你的使命。</p>
<p>Knowledge knows. Knowledge within you really knows why you are here and what you must do. It really knows who you must meet and where you must go. And yet Knowledge is dynamic. It is not simply having a pre-recognition of things. It is moving in dynamic relationship with the movement of the world.</p>
<p>内识知道。你内在的内识确实知道你为何在此以及你必须做什么。它确实知道你必须遇见谁以及你必须去哪里。然而内识是动态的。它不仅仅是对事物有预先认知。它与世界的运动在动态的关系中移动。</p>
<p>So if things change, which they are, if circumstances require a different set of actions, well, Knowledge responds immediately. So it is not like you have a plan that is already pre-described. It must constantly be adapting itself to the changing circumstances of life around you.</p>
<p>因此，如果事情发生变化（事实确实如此），如果情况需要采取不同的行动，内识就会立即做出回应。因此，这并不是说你有一个预先描述好的计划。它必须不断适应你周围不断变化的生命环境。</p>
<p>This is why static definitions are inherently incorrect because they cannot adapt. People try to adapt their experiences to their definitions of themselves, their definitions of what they are doing in life, but this is backwards.</p>
<p>这就是为什么静态定义本质上是不正确的，因为静态定义无法适应。人们试图让他们的体验适应他们对他们自己的定义，适应他们对他们在生命中所做的事情的定义，但这是本末倒置的。</p>
<p>Knowledge is able to respond in the moment. It is able to change the plan. It is able to redirect you if circumstances require it. That is why the man or woman of Knowledge must learn to live without a lot of personal definitions. “Well, this is who I am, and this is what I do, and this is how I am, and this is what I believe, and this is my belief system, and this is what I think the world means and life means and purpose means and love means, and so forth.”</p>
<p>内识能够即时作出回应。它能够改变计划。如果情况需要，它能够引导你。这就是为什么内识的男人或女人必须学会在没有太多个人定义的情况下生活。“好吧，这就是我，这就是我所做的，这就是我的样子，这就是我的信仰，这是我的信仰体系，这就是我认为的世界意义、生命意义、目的意义和爱的意义，等等。”</p>
<p>People who are bound by all these definitions cannot move with life. They try to make life move according to their prescriptions, but they cannot move and flow with life. They are bound now by their own ideas and ideologies.</p>
<p>被所有这些定义束缚的人无法与生命同行。他们试图让生命按照他们的规定前进，但他们无法与生命一起前进和流动。他们现在被他们自身的想法和意识形态所束缚。</p>
<p>Therefore, in learning The Way of Knowledge, you learn how to be present in the moment, how to be responsive to your environment, how to follow Knowledge, and to learn to think like Knowledge thinks, and to gain the great awareness of Knowledge, the great power of Knowledge, and the grace of Knowledge because remember, Knowledge is your relationship to God. It is the God within you.</p>
<p>因此，在学习内识之路时，你将学会如何活在当下，如何对周围环境做出反应，如何追随内识，学会像内识那样思考，获得对内识的伟大觉知、内识的伟大力量和内识的恩典，因为记住，内识是你与上帝的关系。它是你内在的上帝。</p>
<p>So each person has this mysterious deeper Intelligence within them. Now obviously most people are not aware of this or connected to it sufficiently that it can really affect their thinking and their behavior. So it is really more like a potential even though Knowledge is really there.</p>
<p>因此，每个人内心都有这种神秘的更深层次的智能。显然，大多数人没有察觉到这一点，也没有充分地与它联接，以至于它无法真正影响他们的思维和行为。所以，尽管内识确实存在，但它实际上更像是一种潜力。</p>
<p>You see, no matter how isolated anyone may feel they are in life, which is really the source of all human suffering, no matter how separate or cast out anyone may think they are, or feel that they are, they are still connected to God. They are connected through Knowledge. So it could be said, then, that taking the Steps to Knowledge is like taking the Steps to God—the God within you and the God within everyone else.</p>
<p>你看，无论人们在生命中感到多么孤立，这其实是所有人类苦难的根源，无论人们认为他们多么孤立或被排斥，或者感觉他们多么孤立或被排斥，他们仍然与上帝相连。他们通过内识相连。因此可以说，开展内识的进阶就像迈向上帝的阶梯——你内在的上帝和每个人内在的上帝。</p>
<p>Some people try to make every aspect of a person Godlike or connected to God, but this is not accurate. The only thing that God created in you is Knowledge. Everything else is a product of your self-creation and co-creation with other people living in Separation.</p>
<p>有些人试图让一个人的每一个方面都像神一样或与上帝相连，但这并不准确。上帝在你身上创造的唯一创造是内识。其他一切都是你的自我创造和与其他生活在分离中的人共同创造的产物。</p>
<p>Now some people may say: “Oh, I don’t believe that! I think God created everything!” But if you think like that, then you must justify everything, and that becomes increasingly difficult to do if you are really honest and objective in your observations of life around you.</p>
<p>现在有些人可能会说：“哦，我不相信！我认为上帝创造了一切！”但如果你这样想，那么你就必须证明一切，而如果你真的诚实客观地观察周围的生命，这一点就会变得越来越困难。</p>
<p>So learning The Way of Knowledge is like learning The Way of God. Taking the Steps to Knowledge is like taking the Steps to God. Living the life of Knowledge is like living the life of God in the world.</p>
<p>因此，学习内识之路就如同学习上帝之路。开展内识的进阶就如同迈向上帝的阶梯。过着内识的生命就如同在世间过着上帝的生命。</p>
<p>So each person has this deeper, more powerful Intelligence. But people do not listen. They do not respond. It is as if it does not exist. People’s minds dominate everything. Their beliefs, their thinking, their social conditioning, their attitudes, their convictions, even their beliefs about God completely dominate a person’s life and perspective, so much so that they cannot really know anything, and the greater Mind of Knowledge within them really is beyond their reach.</p>
<p>因此，每个人都有这种更深层次、更强大的智能。但人们不听。他们不回应。就好像它不存在一样。人们的心灵主宰一切。他们的信仰、他们的思维、他们的社会条件、他们的态度、他们的信念，甚至他们对上帝的信仰完全主宰着一个人的生命和观点，以至于他们无法真正知道任何事情，他们内在更伟大的内识心灵确实超出了他们的能力范围。</p>
<p>They are like slaves to the forces that move people about in the world. They are slaves to fear. They are slaves to desire. They are slaves to their own convictions that are born of fear and desire.</p>
<p>他们就像是世界上那些驱使人们势力的奴隶。他们是恐惧的奴隶。他们是欲望的奴隶。他们是他们自身因恐惧和欲望而产生的信念的奴隶。</p>
<p>Indeed, everyone who lives in the world has had this experience, and most people still live within it very fully. To break out of the personal hell of isolation, to break out of the domination of the mind and the domination of your social conditioning represents freedom in the most fundamental way. For you can be free in the world, but if you are not free inside, you cannot really take advantage of your external freedom.</p>
<p>事实上，世界上的每个人都有过这样的经历，而且大多数人仍然充分地生活在其中。摆脱孤立的个人地狱，摆脱心灵的支配和社会条件的支配，从最根本上代表着自由。因为你可以在世界上自由，但如果你内心不自由，你就无法真正践行你的外在自由。</p>
<p>Look about you in the world. People seem to be free, relatively speaking, compared to say other people in the world. And look what they do with their freedom. They become lost in addictions, they make horrendous mistakes in their relationships and they abuse themselves physically and emotionally.</p>
<p>看看这个世界。与世界上的其他人相比，人们似乎相对自由。看看他们如何使用他们的自由。他们沉迷于毒瘾，在人际关系中犯下可怕的错误，在他们的身体和他们的情感上虐待他们自己。</p>
<p>Certainly, you have seen this. Even within yourself, you know you are not free. Freedom is not simply having no obligations in life or not being accountable to anyone. Freedom really in its greatest and most real sense is the ability to find and to follow Knowledge because here you are finally free to do what you came here to do, which is the source of all real integrity and satisfaction.</p>
<p>当然，你已经看到了这一点。即使在你自己的内心，你也知道你并不自由。自由并不只是在生命中没有义务或不对任何人负责。自由在其最伟大和最真实的意义上，是找到并遵循内识的能力，因为在这里你终于可以自由地做你来这里要做的事情，这是所有真正的完整性和满足的源泉。</p>
<p>So trying to gain more external freedom without this internal freedom,it will not lead to a good result. For your soul will only be satisfied if you can fulfill what you came here to do. This is the deeper happiness that is the real happiness.</p>
<p>因此，试图获得更多的外部自由而没有这种内部自由，不会带来好的结果。因为只有当你能完成你来此要做的事情时，你的灵魂才会感到满足。这才是更深层次的幸福，是真正的幸福。</p>
<p>Yes, there are lighthearted moments. Yes, there are fun things to do in the world. But when We talk about real happiness, We are talking about the satisfaction and the sense of integrity that come from really engaging yourself in your greater purpose and mission here. And to do that, you must find and follow Knowledge because only Knowledge knows what it really is.</p>
<p>是的，有轻松的时刻。是的，世界上有许多有趣的事情可以做。但是当我们谈论真正的幸福时，我们谈论的是真正投入到你在此的更伟大目的和使命中所带来的满足感和完整性的感觉。而要做到这一点，你必须找到并遵循内识，因为只有内识知道它真正是什么。</p>
<p>There are endless beliefs and speculations about spirituality and spiritual purpose and the meaning of your connection to God and spiritual practice and all this. But only Knowledge knows. If you are not connected to Knowledge, no matter how fervently you may believe, no matter how much you may build your idea of yourself upon your spiritual attitudes or beliefs, you do not yet know. And without this freedom to know, you are not really free.</p>
<p>关于精神性和精神目的，以及你与上帝的联接和精神实践的意义，有无数的信仰和猜测。但只有内识知道。如果你没有与内识相连，无论你多么热切地相信，无论你多么将你的自我观念建立在你的精神态度或信仰之上，你都还无法知晓。而没有这种知晓的自由，你就不是真正自由的。</p>
<p>So this brings Us then to learning The Way of Knowledge. Is The Way of Knowledge one Teaching? No. There are many teachings that teach The Way of Knowledge. Yet they are still the minority of spiritual teachings in the world, for most spiritual teachings only teach belief and attitude, and give prescriptions for positive living or constructive living, and so forth.</p>
<p>因此，这就引出了我们学习内识之路。内识之路是一种教导吗？不是。有许多教导内识之路的教导。但它们仍然是世界上少数的精神教导，因为大多数精神教导只教导信仰和态度，并为积极的生活或建设性生活开出处方，等等。</p>
<p>Most spiritual teachings in the world do not reflect The Way of Knowledge. Perhaps it could be said that these teachings really are for people who are not yet ready to learn The Way of Knowledge, but this is only an excuse. Do not try to justify it. It cannot really be justified.</p>
<p>世界上大多数精神教导都没有体现内识之路。也许可以说这些教导确实是为那些尚未准备好学习内识之路的人准备的，但这只是借口。不要试图为其辩解。它真的无法得到辩解。</p>
<p>So there is more than one Teaching in The Way of Knowledge, but these Teachings are rare, and the real teachers of The Way of Knowledge are hard to find. They are not the teachers who are presenting the teachings that will make you feel glamorous or beautiful or radiant or give you high experiences or moving into other dimensions and so forth.</p>
<p>因此，内识之路中存在不止一种教导，但这些教导非常稀少，真正的内识之路老师也很难找到。他们并不是那些传授教导让你感觉魅力四射、美丽动人、光芒四射或给你带来极致体验或让你进入其他维度等等的老师。</p>
<p>They are not the teachings that teach physical or emotional healing. These teachings may be very helpful to prepare someone for The Way of Knowledge, but they are rarely The Way of Knowledge itself because most spiritual teachings emphasize belief, attitude and behavior as the main focal point. They have not really hit the mark. They have not really gone to the source of [where] real happiness, wholeness and integrity exists and where it can emerge throughout your entire Being.</p>
<p>它们不是教导身体治愈或情感治愈的教导。这些教导可能对为内识之路做准备非常有帮助，但它们很少是内识之路本身，因为大多数精神教导都强调信仰、态度和行为是主要焦点。它们并没有真正击中要害。它们并没有真正找到真正的幸福、整体性和完整性的源头，也没有找到它们可以贯穿你的整个存在。</p>
<p>It is okay. There are different levels of teaching for different people. But everyone needs to learn The Way of Knowledge at some point, and the sooner the better. Remember, no justification, no excuses.</p>
<p>没有关系。不同的人有不同的教学层面。但每个人都需要在某个时候学习内识之路，而且越早越好。记住，没有理由，没有借口。</p>
<p>However, The Way of Knowledge must be presented in certain ways to correspond with the greater events that are happening in the world. It is not like a static teaching. As We have said, Knowledge responds to the conditions of the world and the circumstances of the world in order to fulfill its mission here. That is why Knowledge is wise. That is why it is effective.</p>
<p>然而，内识之路必须以某些方式呈现，以对应世界上正在发生的更伟大事件。它不像是一种静态的教导。正如我们所说，内识回应世界的状况和世界的情况，以完成它在此的使命。这就是为什么内识是明智的。这就是为什么它是有效的。</p>
<p>Thus, the teaching in The Way of Knowledge must also be responsive to the conditions of the world, and that is why the Creator keeps giving The Way of Knowledge in new manifestations in order to have the greatest impact given the important events that are going to shape and to affect your life.</p>
<p>因此，内识之路的教导也必须对世界的状况作出回应，这就是为什么造物主不断以新的表现形式给予内识之路，以便对那些将要塑造和影响你的生命的重要事件产生最大的影响。</p>
<p>Such a new Revelation in The Way of Knowledge has recently been given in the Teaching called The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. This is a Teaching that prepares people to engage with the reality that you are no longer alone in the universe or even within your own world. It is the reality that humanity is emerging into a Greater Community and must learn about the realities of life within the universe and the meaning of spirituality beyond the limits of human understanding.</p>
<p>最近，名为大社区内识之路的教学中就给出了这样一个新的内识之路启示。这个教导让人们做好准备，去面对这样一个现实：在宇宙中，甚至在你自身的世界里，你们都不再是孤单的。这个现实是，人类正在步入一个大社区，必须学习宇宙中的生命现实以及超越人类理解极限的精神性意义。</p>
<p>This is a new Revelation of learning The Way of Knowledge. What has changed is the context because the context is changing in your life, and the circumstances of your life are changing. So a Teaching that was given 300 years ago is no longer completely relevant. It must be given in a new expression.</p>
<p>这是学习内识之路的新启示。改变的是背景，因为你生命中的背景正在改变，你的生命环境也在改变。因此，300年前的教导不再完全相关。它必须以一种新的表达方式来传达。</p>
<p>That is why art and literature keep regenerating themselves because the great insights must be given a new form, a new expression. In the reality of spirituality, this new expression must be given at least periodically.</p>
<p>这就是为什么艺术和文学正在不断自我更新，因为伟大的洞察力必须被赋予新的形式、新的表达。在精神性的现实中，这种新的表达必须至少定期地被赋予。</p>
<p>So a unique teaching in The Way of Knowledge about life in the Greater Community and about your emergence into the Greater Community is now being given into the world, and the study of this is through the Sacred Text Steps to Knowledge. The center point of this Teaching is learning and living The Way of Knowledge, which is a much greater task than most people really realize.</p>
<p>因此，内识之路中关于大社区生命和你们进入大社区的独特教导现在被传授给世界，而对它的学习是通过神圣文本《内识的进阶》。这个教导的中心点是学习和实践内识之路，这项任务比大多数人真正意识到的要伟大的多。</p>
<p>Only an advancing student begins to see: “Oh, my God! This is really big!” Only they can begin to see and recognize for themselves in their own experience that really everything has to do with Knowledge, and the denial of Knowledge, and the ignorance of Knowledge, and that the world that you see is really the product of these three things: the reality of Knowledge, the denial of Knowledge and the ignorance of Knowledge.</p>
<p>只有进步的学生才会开始看到：“哦，我的上帝！这真是太大了！”只有他们才能在他们自身的经历中开始看到并认识到，实际上一切都与内识、对内识的否定和对内识的无知有关，你看到的世界实际上是这三者的产物：内识的现实、对内识的否定和对内识的无知。</p>
<p>In your Heavenly state, there is only Knowledge, but you are not living in your Heavenly state. Therefore, the denial of Knowledge and the ignorance of Knowledge are very powerful forces in the world, obviously, or the world would not look the way it does. And it is not merely a matter of perception because when people try to just adjust their perception of the world, what happens is they end up becoming very dishonest and denying whole parts of their experience.</p>
<p>在你的天国状态中，只有内识，但你并没有生活在天国的状态中。因此，否定内识和无视内识显然是世界上非常强大的力量，否则世界就不会是现在这个样子。这不仅仅是一个感知问题，因为当人们试图调整他们对世界的感知时，他们最终会变得非常不诚实，否认他们整个的经历。</p>
<p>If you only want to see the good and the happy and the pretty things, what happens? You begin to deny the reality of everything else. And you are unable then to respond to the world as it really is. You are unable to respond to yourself as you really are. And you end up becoming really susceptible to manipulation by other people because you are so preferential in your thinking.</p>
<p>如果你只想看到好的、快乐和美好的事物，会发生什么？你开始否认其他一切的现实。然后你就无法对真实的世界做出回应。你无法对真实的你自己做出回应。最终，你会变得非常容易受到他人的操纵，因为你的思维太过偏颇。</p>
<p>This is not the way to Knowledge. This is not the way to find real certainty and stability in life. Lying to yourself and to other people does not produce a good result and makes you very vulnerable to very dangerous and dark forces in the world—forces of ignorance, forces of manipulation and control. The man or woman of Knowledge always will avoid these things, but they will always make sure they recognize what they are and how they manifest themselves.</p>
<p>这不是通向内识的道路。这不是找到生命中真正的确定性和稳定性的道路。欺骗你自己和他人不会产生好的结果，会让你非常容易受到世界上非常危险和黑暗的势力的伤害——无知的力量、操纵和控制的力量。拥有内识的男人或女人总是会避开这些事情，但他们总是会确保他们认识到它们是什么以及它们如何展现他们自己。</p>
<p>This brings Us to a very important point here because in learning The Way of Knowledge, you become fundamentally honest. You take life as it is. You face life as it is. You do not try to pretend. You do not say, “Well, I will experience only this part of life and I will tune out everything else,” or “I will only express these feelings but not those feelings,” or “I will only know these things within myself but not all these other things.”</p>
<p>这给我们带来了一个非常重要的观点，因为在学习内识之路时，你会变得从根本上诚实。你接受生命的本来面目。你面对生命的本来面目。你不会试图假装。你不会说：“好吧，我只会体验生命的这一部分，我会忽略其他一切”，或者“我只会表达这些感受，而不会表达那些感受”，或者“我只会知道我自己内心的这些事物，而不去知道所有这些其他的事物。”</p>
<p>Real honesty requires the willingness to face anything that you have to face. It is this faith in life, it is this trust in your inherent power that gives you the strength to do this. Without this awareness, without this connection to Knowledge, you will be too afraid. You will not want to face things in the world. You will not want to face things in yourself. You will not want to face things in your marriage, in your work, in your health.</p>
<p>真正的诚实需要愿意面对你必须面对的一切。正是这种对生命的信仰，正是这种对你内在力量的信任，给了你这样做的力量。没有这种觉知，没有这种与内识的联接，你会太害怕。你不会想面对世界上的事情。你不会想面对你自己身上的事情。你不会想面对婚姻中、工作中、健康中的事情。</p>
<p>You will live in this sort of state of denial that is so destructive to your well-being and happiness and that really prevents you from gaining access to the one thing that is going to bring your life into fulfillment and happiness and integrity—that is finding and fulfilling your greater purpose for being here.</p>
<p>你将生活在这种否定状态中，这对你的福祉和幸福极具破坏性，它真正阻止你获得能给你的生命带来充实、幸福和完整的内识——那就是找到并实现你存在于此的更伟大目的。</p>
<p>What is that purpose? Knowledge knows. How do you find that purpose? By learning and living The Way of Knowledge. Take the Steps to Knowledge. This is the most important thing. In the process of doing this, many significant things begin to happen. And We would like to speak about this now.</p>
<p>这个目的是什么？内识知道。你要如何找到这个目的？通过学习和生活在内识之路。开展内识的进阶。这是最重要的事情。在这样做的过程中，许多重要的事情开始发生。我们现在想谈论这个。</p>
<p>First of all, you develop a spiritual practice. Spiritual practice is essential for learning greater things about yourself and about life. Having philosophies or making assumptions or reading books that fill your mind with more ideas and assumptions, well, that cannot work.</p>
<p>首先，你要进行精神练习。精神练习对于了解你自己和生命至关重要。拥有哲学、做出假设或阅读让你的心灵充满更多想法和假设的书籍，这些都行不通。</p>
<p>You must build the bridge from your mind to Knowledge, and that bridge is not built in a day or a week or a month. You are undertaking something very great here, and it requires perseverance and a commitment. Therefore, you do not want to dabble with this. “Well, I’ll try it out for a week and see how it goes.” You cannot approach a great Teaching like this and have any hope of learning it or understanding it.</p>
<p>你必须搭建从你的心灵到内识的桥梁，而这座桥梁不是一天、一周或一个月就能建成的。你正在做一件非常伟大的事情，它需要毅力和承诺。因此，你不应该轻易涉足此事。“好吧，我会尝试一周，看看效果如何。”你无法接近这样的伟大教导，并抱有任何学习或理解它的希望。</p>
<p>Most people still think they can really understand things with their intellect. Well, you can understand mechanical things. You can understand how your radio works. You can figure out how to follow a map, and there are certain very practical things that the intellect is very, very good at determining and creating and understanding.</p>
<p>大多数人仍然认为他们真的可以用智力理解事物。好吧，你可以理解机械的事物。你可以理解收音机的工作原理。你可以弄清楚如何按照地图行走，而且智力非常非常擅长确定、创造和理解某些非常实用的事物。</p>
<p>But We are talking about the essence and the meaning of your life here. We are talking about the Will of the Creator that lives within you. We are not talking about simple, mechanical or logistical things. The intellect cannot possibly comprehend these [greater] things, and the more it tries, the more convoluted its ideas become, the more complex its theories, the more it must try to deal with certain contradictions that it cannot fathom or move beyond. You have seen this.</p>
<p>但我们在此谈论的是你生命的本质和意义。我们谈论的是活在你内在的造物主的意志。我们谈论的不是简单、机械或逻辑的事物。智力不可能理解这些[更伟大的]事情，它越是尝试，它的想法就变得越复杂，它的理论就越复杂，它就越必须试图应对它无法理解或超越的某些矛盾。你已经看到了这一点。</p>
<p>There are many, many thick books written about people’s attempt to understand the Creator and the meaning of life with their intellect. The man or woman of Knowledge knows this is not possible. The intellect is a wonderful tool, but it is not a tool made for this task. Here you must find the greater resources that live within you.</p>
<p>有许多厚厚的书都记载了人们试图用智力去理解造物主和生命的意义。有内识的人知道这是不可能的。智力是一种奇妙的工具，但它不是为这项任务而生的工具。在这里你必须找到生活在你内心的更伟大资源。</p>
<p>So in beginning the study of Steps to Knowledge, the Book of Practices in learning The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, you begin to develop a spiritual practice. This requires first that you show up every day, which means that you must adjust other parts of your life and gain greater control over your circumstances.</p>
<p>因此，在开始学习《内识进阶》——学习大社区内识之路的实践之书时，你开始发展一种精神实践。这首先要求你每天都出现，这意味着你必须调整生命的其他部分，更好地控制你的处境。</p>
<p>This in itself is a very significant step because many people really do not think they have any control over their lives, and beginning a spiritual practice gives you the opportunity to do just that. People go to the bathroom several times a day, they perhaps take a shower every day, they eat food every day. Why not a spiritual practice every day?</p>
<p>这本身就是非常重要的一步，因为许多人真的认为他们无法控制他们的生活，而开始精神练习可以让你有机会做到这一点。人们每天都要上几次厕所，也许每天都要洗澡，每天都要吃饭。为什么不能每天都进行一种精神练习呢？</p>
<p>You make time for these other things because they are recognized as being important or even necessary. When you recognize that your spiritual practice is important and necessary, you will begin to carve out time to give to it, and this is needed.</p>
<p>你腾出时间做这些其他的事情，是因为它们被认为是重要的甚至是必要的。当你认识到你的精神练习是重要和必要的，你就会开始腾出时间去做，这是必要的。</p>
<p>This consistent application is really the basis of accumulating learning, aggregate learning. You do not just try to dive in once in a while. You practice every day. If you miss a day, it is okay, but you come back the next day and you keep with it until it becomes part of the flow of your life, until you make a place [for it] in your life. Then things begin to revolve around your spiritual practice rather than trying to fit it in somewhere where there seems to be nowhere.</p>
<p>这种坚持不懈的应用是积累学习、综合学习的基础。你不能只是偶尔尝试一下。你每天都要练习。如果你错过了一天，没关系，但你第二天会再来，一直坚持下去，直到它成为你生命的一部分，直到你在生命中为它留出一席之地。然后，事情就会开始围绕你的精神练习展开，而不是试图把它塞进一个似乎无处可去的地方。</p>
<p>So every day you practice the Steps to Knowledge. You begin very simply. You begin to practice every day. You begin to make time and give it your consideration and make it a priority for yourself and so forth.</p>
<p>因此，你每天都在练习内识的进阶。你从非常简单的地方开始。你开始每天练习。你开始腾出时间，考虑它，把它作为你自己的优先事项等等。</p>
<p>This is an act of personal integrity and personal power to do this. You are not doing this to look good in the world. You are not doing this to please your parents. You are not doing this to make more money. You are not doing this to win favors or get rewards, necessarily. You are doing it because you realize it must be, that you really need it, just like you need to stay clean and clothed and fed and get rest and go to work. It becomes one of the essential needs of your life. This you establish every day you practice.</p>
<p>这是一种个人完整性和个人力量的表现。你这样做不是为了在世人面前显得有面子。你这样做不是为了取悦父母。你这样做不是为了赚更多的钱。你这样做不一定是为了赢得恩惠或获得奖励。你这样做是因为你意识到你确实需要它，就像你需要保持干净、穿衣、吃饱、休息和工作一样。它成为你生命中的基本需求之一。这是你每天实践时建立起来的。</p>
<p>It is like saying to yourself, “This is important and I will give this time today.” You will be amazed at how your life will respond to your commands. But you must make some commands to see this.</p>
<p>它就像对你自己说：“这是重要的，我今天会花时间去做。”你会惊讶地发现你的生命会如何回应你的命令。但你必须发出一些命令才能看到这一点。</p>
<p>Steps to Knowledge begins very simply, and then it begins to establish certain fundamental skills. The first skill as We have mentioned is the skill of consistency. Whatever you do consistently, you become good at. Whatever you do consistently requires less and less effort as you continue. Whatever you do consistently makes you available to greater thresholds of learning.</p>
<p>内识进阶的起点非常简单，然后它开始建立某些基本技能。正如我们提到的，第一个技能是坚持不懈的技能。无论你坚持做什么，你都会变得擅长。无论你坚持做什么，随着你继续做下去，需要的努力就会越来越少。无论你坚持做什么，都会让你达到更伟大的学习门槛。</p>
<p>Steps to Knowledge then begins a whole process of self-inquiry, where you look into your experience very objectively. This is so powerful because most people never look at their experience objectively.</p>
<p>内识进阶开启了整个自我探究的过程，在这个过程中，你会非常客观地审视你的经历。这非常有力，因为大多数人从不客观地看待他们的经历。</p>
<p>Perhaps sometimes after great, sad or traumatic events, they will really do some kind of honest reckoning with their lives. They will look at their lives and they will say, “Yes, I really do need to make some changes in the way that I live. I need to lose weight,” or “I need to change my job,” or “I need to improve myself in some specific way,” and they see it clearly. It is not simply a good idea. It is not simply a New Year’s resolution. It is really, “Yes, I really have to do this!” Sometimes that recognition is enough to propel people into action. Often it is not.</p>
<p>也许有时在经历了重大、悲伤或创伤性事件后，他们会真正对他们的生活进行某种诚实的反思。他们会审视他们的生活，然后说：“是的，我确实需要改变我的生活方式。我需要减肥”，或者“我需要换工作”，或者“我需要在某些特定方面提高我自己”，他们会清楚地看到这一点。它不仅仅是一个好主意。它不仅仅是一个新年决心。它是实际的，“是的，我真的必须这样做！”有时这种认知足以促使人们采取行动。但通常情况并非如此。</p>
<p>In the practice of Steps to Knowledge, you begin to really look at the content of your experience. You become connected to what you really experience, not what you think you should experience or what you want to experience. You become really, really connected to what you are really experiencing. And all the deception about what makes people happy, and all of the running away from yourself, and all of the trying to hide in this or pretend about that, begin to fall away.</p>
<p>在内识进阶的实践中，你开始真正审视你的体验内容。你开始与你真正体验到的事物建立联系，而不是你认为你应该体验到的事物或你想要体验到的东西。你开始与你真正体验到的事物建立真正的联接。所有关于什么能让人快乐的欺骗、所有逃避自我、所有试图隐藏在这里或假装那里的行为，都开始消失。</p>
<p>The person only really becomes honest and self-aware when there is no other alternative, when there is no place to hide, when it is seen that hiding only hurts you and prevents you from gaining your real strength.</p>
<p>一个人只有在别无选择、无处可藏的时候，只有在看到躲藏只会伤害自己、阻碍自己获得真正力量的时候，才会真正变得诚实和有自知之明。</p>
<p>So in the practice of Steps to Knowledge, you develop consistency, and you begin a long process of self-inquiry. Yet this process of self-inquiry is not simply a conversation with yourself. It is not a psychological process as much as it is a matter of looking and listening.</p>
<p>因此，在内识进阶的实践中，你会培养一致性，并开始一个漫长的自我探究过程。然而，这个自我探究过程不仅仅是与你自己的对话。它不是一个心理过程，而是一个观察和倾听的过程。</p>
<p>So at the beginning of Steps to Knowledge and throughout the study of Steps to Knowledge, you learn how to still your mind. You learn how to become observant. You learn how to look, see, feel, and know.</p>
<p>因此，在内识进阶的开始阶段以及整个内识进阶的学习过程中，你将学习如何平静你的心灵。你将学习如何变得善于观察。你将学习如何观察、看见、感受和知道。</p>
<p>Once your mind becomes still at your command, from the result of you exerting your power, you begin to undo your social conditioning, you begin to undo the domination of your intellect, you begin to see beyond ideas and beliefs and conventions of thought. You see things you could never see before. You hear things you have never heard before.</p>
<p>一旦你的心灵能够在你命令下保持安静，通过你施展的力量，你就会开始解除你的社会束缚，你会开始摆脱你智力的支配，你会开始看到超越想法、信仰和传统思想的事物。你会看到以前看不到的事情。你会听到以前从未听到过的声音。</p>
<p>Yet the things that you see and hear are so resonant, so true to what you really feel and know about life, it is not like you are trying to put some kind of overlay of ideals or beliefs on top of your experience. Really, the contrary is true. You are taking them away.</p>
<p>然而，你所看到和听到的事物是如此地与你产生共鸣，如此地真实地反映了你对生命的真实感受与知道，这并不是说你试图将某种理想或信仰叠加在你的体验之上。实际上，事实恰恰相反。你正在把它们带走。</p>
<p>You begin to feel things that you really, really know. Your perception becomes refined and more objective. Your awareness begins to expand so that you can see and feel and know things that simply could not be recognized [before] because of the constant noise of your mind and the preoccupations that kept you from really seeing and knowing anything about yourself.</p>
<p>你开始感受到你真正知道的事物。你的感知变得更加精细和客观。你的觉知开始扩展，这样你就可以看到、感觉到和知道以前根本无法识别的事物，因为以前你的心灵中一直存在着噪音，还有那些让你无法真正看清和知道你自己的先入之见。</p>
<p>You become sensitive to your body, your mind, other people, the world, but in such a way that you have real inner strength. Practicing stillness of mind is really a prerequisite for [getting] in touch with the real undercurrent of what is going on [within] you and what is going on around you.</p>
<p>你会对你的身体、你的心灵、他人和世界变得敏感，但同时又拥有真正的内在力量。练习心灵的静止实际上是接触你内心和周围正在发生的事情的真正暗流的先决条件。</p>
<p>Steps to Knowledge teaches you how to think about things in a very constructive way. We call this “contemplation.” It is different from meditation. It is contemplation. You are going to contemplate a question about life. You are going to contemplate something, not simply to come up with exciting answers, but really to try to penetrate it, going deeper than the surface where everyone is so caught up.</p>
<p>内识进阶教你如何以一种非常建设性的方式思考事物。我们称之为“沉思”。它不同于冥想。它是沉思。你将沉思一个关于生命的问题。你将沉思某事，不只是为了得到令人兴奋的答案，而是真正试图洞察它，比每个人都如此沉迷的表面更深入。</p>
<p>Your stillness practice is really your meditation because it enables your awareness to go deeper and to connect with Knowledge, which knows. Throughout Steps to Knowledge, you set the stage for this inner connection, and you have an opportunity to build this connection every day in little increments.</p>
<p>你的静止练习其实就是你的冥想，因为它能让你更加深入地觉知并与内识建立联接。在内识进阶中，你为这种内在联接奠定了基础，你有机会每天一点点地建立这种联接。</p>
<p>Your life begins to change, your values begin to change, and you become more connected to yourself, and you realize that you really want quiet more than stimulation, and you realize you really want integrity more than thrills, and you realize you want relationships that have real strength and real direction rather than just exciting interludes with people. This is all the result of refocusing your attention and redirecting your activities and exerting your power to do this.</p>
<p>你的生命开始改变，你的价值观开始改变，你与你自己的联接变得更加紧密，你意识到你真正想要的是安静而不是刺激，你意识到你真正想要的是完整性而不是愉悦，你意识到你想要的是具有真正力量和真正方向的关系，而不仅仅是与人之间的激动人心的插曲。这一切都是重新集中注意力、重新调整活动方向并发挥你的力量的结果。</p>
<p>Another important aspect of the study of Steps to Knowledge is you are engaging with the Angels who oversee your life. They are speaking to you with every word in Steps to Knowledge. They are not giving you only a set of beliefs. They are really giving you a key into your deeper nature and your deeper power, which are meant to be exerted here in very specific ways.</p>
<p>内识进阶研究的另一个重要方面是，你正在与监督你生命的天使互动。他们用内识进阶的每一个字眼对你说话。他们不只是给你一套信念。他们实际上是给你一把通往你更深层次自然和你更深层次力量的钥匙，这些都注定要在这里以非常具体的方式发挥出来。</p>
<p>Because Steps to Knowledge is wholly honest and pure, you must become really honest and pure to follow it and to respond to it. And so it seems like things are falling away from you as you proceed, and your burden becomes lighter, and you become less self-preoccupied and more connected to everything around you, more responsive, whereas before you really could not respond to anything very effectively unless it really hit you over the head because you were so caught up in yourself—your plans for the future, your issues with people, your difficulties, your contradictions, your memories and so forth.</p>
<p>因为内识进阶是完全诚实和纯粹的，你必须变得真正诚实和纯粹才能遵循它并回应它。因此，随着你前进，似乎一切都离你而去，你的负担变得更轻，你变得不那么自我中心，与你周围的一切联系会变得更加紧密，反应会越来越灵敏，而在此之前，你真的无法对任何事情做出非常有效的回应，除非它真的击中了你的要害，因为你太沉溺于你自己——你对未来的计划、你与人之间的问题、你的困难、你的矛盾、你的记忆等等。</p>
<p>Here the mind dominates so much that it becomes like a prison and you cannot get out. It is like you are under house arrest. You cannot leave. You cannot leave the confines of your own personal mind. It dominates you. It restricts you. It torments you. It tantalizes you. And you have no freedom. Even though you appear to be a free person, you have no freedom.</p>
<p>在这里，心灵占据了主导地位，就像一座监狱，你无法逃脱。它就像你被软禁了一样。你无法离开。你无法摆脱你自身个人心灵的束缚。它支配着你。它限制着你。它折磨着你。它诱惑着你。你没有自由。即使你看起来是一个自由的人，你也没有自由。</p>
<p>Learning The Way of Knowledge, then, begins to break this all down. That is why it seems like in the early stages, in the early part of the preparation, like things are really falling away and changing. And it can be very unsettling because you have identified so much with so many things outside of yourself. As you begin to break free of these things, it is a very confusing time.</p>
<p>然后，学习内识之路开始打破这一切。这就是为什么在早期阶段，在准备的早期阶段，事情似乎真的在消失和变化。这可能会非常令人不安，因为你已经对你自己之外的许多事物产生了太多的认同。当你开始摆脱这些事物时，这是一个非常混乱的时期。</p>
<p>Perhaps six months into Steps to Knowledge, you [might] say, “Well, I thought everything would be clear and my life would be coming together right now!” But what is happening is things are falling away and becoming rearranged, not from the outside in but from the inside out. It is like Knowledge is beginning to rearrange your life as quickly as you will allow it to do so, so that you can set the stage for beginning a new life because you do not jump from one life to another. You really have to dismantle the old life.</p>
<p>也许在内识进阶的六个月后，你会说：“好吧，我以为一切都会明朗起来，我的生命现在就会井然有序！”但实际上，事情正在消失，正在重新安排，不是从外向内，而是从内向外。它就像内识开始以你允许的速度重新安排你的生命，这样你就可以开始为新的生命做好准备，因为你不会从一个生命跳到另一个生命。你真的必须拆除旧的生命。</p>
<p>It is like redoing your house. You have to take everything down. You strip the walls, and perhaps you really take everything down to the bare essentials, and then you begin to rebuild. This process of tearing down and rebuilding really is the spiritual work to be done. And that is the process in Steps to Knowledge.</p>
<p>它就像重新装修你的房子。你必须把所有东西都拆掉。你拆掉墙壁，也许你真的把所有东西都拆到最基本的部分，然后你开始重建。这个拆毁和重建的过程实际上是要做的精神工作。这就是内识进阶中的过程。</p>
<p>Then you will also have times when you are very lucid, and you can really see things, and you understand relationships. “Oh, my God, it is so clear. Human relationships are so simple.” It is so clear to you in that moment, and then the next day, well, you forgot it all and you are back in the soup. But you see, you are breaking through, not all at once, but in pieces. If you break through all at once, you could not adapt.</p>
<p>然后你也会有心灵非常清醒的时候，你真的能看清事物，理解人际关系。“哦，我的上帝，它是如此清晰。人类的关系是如此简单。”那一刻你会觉得关系是如此清晰，但第二天，你却把一切都忘了，又回到了困境之中。但你看，你正在突破，不是一下子，而是一点一点。如果你一下子就突破了，你就无法适应。</p>
<p>There are so many things to become unburdened from in the process because you are still not yet free. You are getting free. You are having moments of freedom. You are having days of freedom. You are having incredible experiences of freedom. But you are not yet free.</p>
<p>在这个过程中，有许多事情需要摆脱，因为你还没有自由。你正在获得自由。你正在经历自由的时刻。你正在经历自由的日子。你正在经历令人难以置信的自由体验。但你还没有自由。</p>
<p>Outside you, the culture is constantly reminding you of what you used to be and reinforcing old ideas that really cannot help you. And so you have considerable opposition just by the general nature of people’s attitudes and beliefs and assumptions—the attitudes, beliefs and assumptions of your culture, of your family, of your friends, and maybe perhaps of your immediate relationships.</p>
<p>在你之外，文化不断提醒你过去的样子，强化那些对你毫无帮助的旧想法。因此，你受到人们普遍的态度、信念和假设的强烈反对——你的文化、你的家庭、你的朋友，也许还有你的直系亲属的态度、信念和假设。</p>
<p>So it is a very, very courageous thing to do to gain your freedom. You do not live in a free world, and you are not a free person. Not really. So Steps to Knowledge really is the road to freedom, real freedom—freedom to be inner directed, freedom to have real integrity, freedom to be able to think freely, to think creatively, to think spontaneously.</p>
<p>因此，为了获得自由，你需要非常非常勇敢。你并不生活在一个自由的世界，你也不是一个自由的人。真的不是。因此，内识进阶确实是通往自由的道路，真正的自由——内心的自由，真正完整性的自由，能够自由思考、创造性思考、自发思考的自由。</p>
<p>Before that happens, everyone thinks according to patterns. They think according to prescriptions. And they generally think what they are told to think through their social and family programming. That is why there is so little original thinking out there. There is so little originality. There is so little real creativity. There is a whole lot of imitation. There is a whole lot of imagination. But it all begins to look the same, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>在此之前，每个人都是按照模式思考的。他们按照处方思考。他们通常按照社会和家庭程序所要求的方式思考。这就是为什么原创思维如此之少。原创性如此之少。真正的创造力如此之少。模仿太多。想象力太多。但一切看起来都是一样的，不是吗？</p>
<p>People are really copying each other. Where is the real originality? Where is the real dynamic thinking? Where is the breakthrough? You might as well be on a chain gang out building the road. Everyone is doing what everyone else is doing. When you look behind and beyond the appearance of personal freedom, it looks like a chain gang. When you look at where people really are in their thinking and their evaluations of themselves, and you see how little originality there is, and you see how people really are just simply going along with everything else, it looks like a chain gang.</p>
<p>人们确实在互相抄袭。真正的原创性在哪里？真正的动态思维在哪里？突破在哪里？你就像在修路的劳役队里。每个人都在做别人正在做的事情。当你看到个人自由的表象背后和表象之外，它看起来就像是一个劳役队。当你观察人们真正的思维和自我评价时，你会发现他们是多么的缺乏原创性，你会看到人们实际上只是简单地随波逐流，它看起来就像是一个劳役队。</p>
<p>The man or woman of Knowledge will see this so clearly once they are able to see clearly. They will not be deceived by appearances. They will not look at beauty and see real beauty. They will not look at wealth and power and glamour and all these things and be swayed by them because they will be able to see through them because their minds have been freed enough to do this.</p>
<p>一旦拥有内识的男人或女人能够看得清清楚楚，他们就会清楚地看到这一点。他们不会被外表所欺骗。他们不会只看美，而是会看到真正的美。他们不会只看财富、权力、魅力和所有这些东西，也不会被它们所左右，因为他们能够看透它们，因为他们的心灵已经足够自由，可以做到这一点。</p>
<p>Because Steps to Knowledge is a gift from God, it is a really mysterious process. It is happening at a deeper level, really. All these things We are describing, well, they are all happening, but something else is really happening too, on the inside, and that is that Knowledge, because you are giving it your attention and your focus on a consistent basis, is becoming stronger and stronger. Its influence is great on you.</p>
<p>因为内识进阶是来自上帝的礼物，所以它是一个非常神秘的过程。它确实发生在更深层次的层面上。我们所描述的所有这些事情，嗯，它们都在发生，但还有一些事情也真的在发生，在内心深处，它就是内识，因为你在持续关注它，专注它，它正变得越来越强大。它对你的影响是伟大的。</p>
<p>Over time you begin to realize, almost fearfully: “Oh, my God! There is this great power living within me. I am afraid of it! I don’t know what it is going to do, what it is going to say!” But it is also your Homecoming, and so it is like you are reclaiming yourself. It is beautiful. But it is tremendous and powerful too.</p>
<p>随着时间的推移，你开始意识到，几乎是恐惧的：“哦，我的天哪！我的内心生活着一种伟大的力量。我害怕它！我不知道它会做什么，它会说什么！”但这也是你的回家之路，所以它就像你在重新找回你自己。它是美丽的。但它也是巨大而强大的。</p>
<p>Of course, there are many mistakes to make along the way. People make many mistakes in their evaluation of Knowledge because they are not yet connected to it sufficiently. They make a lot of assumptions about themselves because they do not really know themselves yet.</p>
<p>当然，一路上会犯很多错误。人们在评估内识时会犯很多错误，因为他们还没有充分地与内识建立联接。他们对他们自己做了许多假设，因为他们还没有真正知道他们自己。</p>
<p>That is why you do need a teacher periodically because a book can tell you the right thing to do, but it cannot tell you when you are doing it wrong. Even Steps to Knowledge, which as a book is an incredibly powerful mechanism for initiating you into the greater spiritual reality from which you have come, even it requires instruction from someone who is gifted, someone who knows the way and who has traveled the way. And you need other people to help you because this is not meant to simply isolate you further within yourself, but to bridge you to other people who share your great journey.</p>
<p>这就是为什么你确实需要定期找一位老师，因为一本书可以告诉你该做什么，但它不能告诉你什么时候做错了。即使是《内识进阶》这本书，它是一种非常强大的机制，可以引导你进入你来自的更伟大的精神现实，但它也需要来自一个有礼物的人、一位知道这条路并走过这条路的人的指导。你需要其他人来帮助你，因为这并不意味着简单地让你进一步孤立于你自己，而是要让你与其他与你共享伟大旅程的人建立桥梁。</p>
<p>So having a teacher, such as Marshall Vian Summers, and having others to practice with, and to share your experiences with, and to help you not make mistakes, and to give you strength when you seem to falter—this is all so important.</p>
<p>因此，拥有一位老师，比如马歇尔·维安·萨默斯，有其他人与你一起练习，与你分享经验，帮助你避免犯错，在你似乎动摇的时候给你力量——这一切都非常重要。</p>
<p>It is not simply your weakness here. You are overcoming the world. You are overcoming everything the world wants you to think and to believe and to become in order to gain the freedom to become what you really are and to do what God has really sent you to do, and to reclaim your own integrity and to have that come from within you and to have it be verified by others who are free enough to confirm this for you.</p>
<p>这并非只是你的弱点。你正在战胜这个世界。你正在战胜这个世界要你去想、去相信、去成为的一切，以便获得自由，成为真正的你，去做上帝真正派你去做的事，重新找回你自己的完整性，让这种完整性发自你的内心，并由其他人来验证，他们有足够的自由来为你证实这一点。</p>
<p>You are overcoming belief. You are overcoming convention. You are overcoming the control of governments. You are overcoming the fear of God. You are overcoming your reluctance to say and do and follow what you really know is true.</p>
<p>你正在克服信仰。你正在克服习俗。你正在克服政府的控制。你正在克服对上帝的恐惧。你正在克服不愿说、不愿做、不愿遵循你真正知道的真理的心理。</p>
<p>This is like a revolution. This takes tremendous courage. And yet what else is there to do? Do you want to stay on the chain gang or do you want to break free? Your real happiness and satisfaction will not be achieved in any other way.</p>
<p>这就像一场革命。这需要巨大的勇气。但除此之外还能做什么呢？你是想继续留在劳役中，还是想挣脱束缚？除了劳役之外，你无法获得真正的幸福和满足。</p>
<p>You can engage yourself in happy activities all day long, but you will not be happy because you know you are not doing what you came here to do, and only Knowledge knows what it is.</p>
<p>你可以整天从事快乐的活动，但你不会快乐，因为你知道你没有做你来这里要做的事情，只有内识知道它是什么。</p>
<p>That is why you learn and follow The Way of Knowledge. That is why you overcome your ambivalence and you begin to practice Steps to Knowledge as an essential activity in your life, rather than something you will get to it when you can, when a moment becomes free perhaps. You are gaining your freedom, and you are setting an example for others to regain theirs.</p>
<p>这就是为什么你学习并遵循内识之路。正因为如此，你克服了矛盾心理，开始把内识进阶作为你生命中必不可少的活动来实践，而不是当你有空时才会去做的事情。你正在获得你的自由，你正在为其他人重获自由树立榜样。</p>
<p>Now Steps to Knowledge has a greater role to serve as well. We would like to speak about this now. Steps to Knowledge, because it is part of a Greater Community Way of Knowledge, is really here also to prepare people for the new reality of your life in the Greater Community. Perhaps this seems way beyond your personal concerns and preoccupations. But what is changing the world and what is altering your destiny are generally happening beyond people’s concerns and preoccupations. That is why they do not see it, feel it and know it.</p>
<p>现在内识的进阶也发挥着一种更伟大的作用。我们现在想谈谈这个问题。内识进阶，因为它是大社区内识之路的一部分，因此，它的真正作用也是让人们为你们在大社区中的新生命做好准备。也许这似乎远远超出了你个人的关注和担忧。但是，改变世界的事情和改变你们天命的事情通常都发生在人们的担忧和关注之外。这就是为什么他们看不到它、感觉不到它、也不知道它。</p>
<p>As you become a greater person, you realize you are here to live a greater life. You are here to live a life that is connected to bigger things in the world and is here to serve greater things in the world.</p>
<p>当你成为一个更伟大的人时，你会意识到你来到这里是为了过上一种更伟大的生命。你来到这里是为了过上与世界上更伟大的事情联接在一起的生命，并服务于世界上更伟大的事物。</p>
<p>Before this, people just want to serve themselves and one or two people they care about. But to the man or woman of Knowledge, it is much bigger than that. That is why they broke free from their early life because it was too small for them. It was too confining. They could not be who they are there. They had to branch out and to gain a greater perspective and understanding.</p>
<p>在此之前，人们只想为他们自己和一两个他们关心的人服务。但对于内识的男人或女人来说，它要比这大得多。这就是为什么他们要摆脱早年的生命，因为那对他们来说太小了。那太局限了。他们无法成为他们自己。他们必须拓展视野，获得一种更伟大的视野和理解。</p>
<p>Certainly, humanity’s emergence into the Greater Community is a very, very big event and a very challenging one as well. Yet who is in a position to really see, feel and know what this is? If everyone is on the chain gang, well, they are only following what has been told for them to follow. They are only following the prescriptions. They do not deviate. Perhaps they will rebel against the system, but that is not freedom.</p>
<p>当然，人类进入大社区是一个非常非常重大的事件，也是一个非常具有挑战性的事件。然而，谁能真正看到、感受到并知道这是什么？如果每个人都被束缚着，那么，他们只是在遵循被告知要他们遵循的事情。他们只是在遵循处方。他们不会偏离。也许他们会反抗这个体系，但那不是自由。</p>
<p>So in studying The Way of Knowledge, you begin to branch out into the world. You begin to look beyond yourself. You begin to look beyond your immediate circumstances to see greater forces at work there. And you recognize that your life is much bigger than you thought it was because this is how Knowledge thinks.</p>
<p>因此，在学习内识之路的过程中，你开始向世界扩展。你开始超越你自己。你开始超越眼前的环境，去看到更伟大的力量在起作用。你会认识到，你的生命比你想象的要伟大得多，因为这就是内识的思考方式。</p>
<p>Knowledge does not preoccupy itself with your daily little activities and what you are going to do on Saturday night. It is really here to accomplish something bigger and to connect you with bigger things and with people who have a greater perspective. Even if your ultimate mission is to do something very simple, you do it with this greater awareness, what We call a “Greater Community awareness.” You recognize that you are part of a greater community within the world and even beyond the world as well. And this final realization really liberates you from all the things that constrained you before.</p>
<p>内识不会专注于你每天的琐碎活动和周六晚上要做的事情。它的存在是为了完成更伟大的事情，让你与更伟大的事情和拥有更广阔视野的人建立联系。即使你的最终使命是做一些非常简单的事情，你也会带着这种更伟大的觉知去做，我们称之为“大社区觉知”。你认识到你是世界内甚至世界之外更大社区的一部分。而这种最终的认知真正将你从之前束缚你的所有事物中解放出来。</p>
<p>This Greater Community awareness begins to connect you to life on a larger scale. This is how Knowledge thinks. This is what Knowledge knows you to be. And this also is the answer to why people do not connect with Knowledge at the outset because they are thinking so small and Knowledge is so big. They are preoccupied with their own personal needs and wishes, and Knowledge is about the world, you see?</p>
<p>这种大社区觉知开始将你与更大规模的生命联系起来。这就是内识的思考方式。这就是内识所知道的你。这也是为什么人们一开始不与内识联系的答案，因为他们的思维太狭隘，而内识却太大。他们专注于他们自身的个人需求和愿望，而内识是关于世界的，你明白吗？</p>
<p>Part of this engages you with a relationship with the world that perhaps was never even there before. Most people in the world today do not even have a relationship with the world. They only have a relationship with the immediate things of their life.</p>
<p>这部分会让你与世界建立一种以前从未有过的关系。当今世界上的大多数人甚至与世界没有关系。他们只与生命中的眼前事物发生了关系。</p>
<p>A great Spirit is here to do great things. It is connected to bigger things. So Steps to Knowledge begins to connect you with bigger things in the world, and it is a very natural development because it is all coming from Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>伟大的精神在这里做伟大的事情。它与更伟大的事物相连。因此内识进阶开始将你与世界上更伟大的事物相连，这是一个非常自然的发展，因为它全都来自你内在的内识。</p>
<p>It is like Steps to Knowledge is helping you give birth to something bigger. It is like the midwife for gaining your true creation. You are pregnant with this creation, but you cannot give birth to it. It creates a pressure for you. You carry it around. And as it grows bigger, it becomes more of a burden. But you need help delivering it. Steps to Knowledge is like the delivery mechanism. Steps to Knowledge and the people who can take the journey with you will really enable you to come through.</p>
<p>它就像内识进阶在帮助你孕育更大的生命。它就像助产士，帮助你获得真正的创造。你怀着这个创造，但你无法孕育它。它给你带来压力。你带着它到处走。随着它变得越来越大，它就变成了一个负担。但你需要帮助来传递它。内识进阶就像是传递机制。内识进阶和那些能和你一起踏上旅程的人将真正帮助你实现目标。</p>
<p>So gaining your Greater Community awareness then really breaks you out of this little idea of yourself and frees you from the little preoccupations that were really like a crown of thorns on your head, that constantly irritated you, constantly restricted your awareness, constantly kept you self-preoccupied and engaged in activities and relationships that really do not represent who and what you are.</p>
<p>因此，获得你的大社区觉知就会真正让你摆脱这种对你自己的狭隘认识，让你摆脱那些就像你头上的荆棘冠冕一样的小烦恼，它们不断地激怒你，不断地限制你的觉知，不断地让你专注于自己，让你参与到那些并不代表你是谁、你是什么的活动和关系中。</p>
<p>As We have said, humanity is emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life. Intelligent races from beyond the world are already in the world, intervening in human affairs. This is the big picture now. It is not the little picture for the little person. It is the big picture for a person who is growing bigger.</p>
<p>正如我们所说，人类正在步入一个智能的生命大社区。来自世界之外的智能种族已经来到这个世界，干预人类的事务。这就是现在的大局。它不是小人物的小局。它是正在成长的人类的大局。</p>
<p>If you want to know your own heart, if you want to know Knowledge, if you want to know why you are really here, then you must connect to the big picture. Overcome your reluctance, your anxiety, your fear and all the social conditioning that tells you, “Well, you can’t do that!”</p>
<p>如果你想要知道你自身的内心，如果你想知道内识，如果你想知道你为什么在这里，那么你必须与大局联系起来。克服你的不情愿、你的焦虑、你的恐惧以及所有告诉你“你不能这样做！”的社会条件！</p>
<p>Steps to Knowledge gradually takes you there because it is freeing you. And when you become free, then Knowledge takes you where Knowledge wants to take you, within you. Steps to Knowledge does not manipulate you. It simply begins to unlock all the gates so that Knowledge within you can take you where you need to go, which is into a bigger life.</p>
<p>内识进阶会逐渐带你到达那里，因为它正在解放你。当你变得自由时，内识会带你去内识想要带你去的地方，在你的内心。内识进阶不会操纵你。它只是开始打开所有的大门，这样你内心的内识就能带你去你需要去的地方，也就是进入一种更大的生命。</p>
<p>Steps to Knowledge gives you some framework to understand this process, but it does not restrict this process. It gives you some definitions. It gives you some ideas in order that your mind can follow along, in order that you can take each step safely and securely and have some structure to help you do that. Because this is not like jumping off the cliff and hoping that you have a good landing.</p>
<p>内识进阶为你提供了一些框架来理解这个过程，但它并不限制这个过程。它给了你一些定义。它给你一些想法，以便你的心灵可以跟上，以便你可以安全地迈出每一步，并有一些结构来帮助你做到这一点。因为这不像跳下悬崖并希望你能安全着陆。</p>
<p>This is a journey, and you must be well equipped for it. Knowledge and the Steps to Knowledge tell you what you need, who you need to be with, where you need to go in order to fulfill this journey and to fulfill what you came here to do.</p>
<p>这是一次旅程，你必须做好充分准备。内识和内识进阶会告诉你，你需要什么，你需要和谁在一起，你需要去哪里，才能完成这次旅程，完成你来此要做的事情。</p>
<p>So you become eventually a Greater Community person. Now you are functioning in a bigger arena of life. Now Knowledge can begin to really manifest itself and to really express itself because finally it has the context where it can do this. It is not trying to funnel itself through the narrow awareness of a small-minded person. It finally has the freedom to emerge and to radiate and to cast its grace around you and to express itself through you so that you can become a vehicle for God, a vehicle for Spirit, a vehicle for the Spirit that is truly you. This is the meaning of real creativity. It is the source of happiness and integrity.</p>
<p>因此，你最终会成为一个大社区的人。现在你在一个更大的生命舞台上运作。现在内识可以开始真正地显现它自己，真正地表达它自己，因为它终于有了可以做到这一点的背景。它不是试图通过一个心胸狭窄的人的狭隘觉知来引导它自己。它终于有自由出现、散发光芒、将它的恩典投射到你周围并通过你表达它自己，这样你就可以成为上帝的载体、精神的载体、真正属于你的精神的载体。这就是真正创造力的意义。它是幸福和完整性的源泉。</p>
<p>It is a gradual journey. You are not going to overcome decades of social conditioning and perhaps personal error overnight. You have to build a new foundation, a new basis of relationship, a new attitude towards work and health, what We call the Four Pillars of your life—Relationships, Work, Health and Spiritual Advancement—all built together to give you a greater foundation so that when your breakthroughs come, you will be able to embrace them. You will be able to pass through the great thresholds that are waiting for you.</p>
<p>它是一段循序渐进的旅程。你不可能一夜之间克服几十年的社会制约和个人错误。你必须建立一个新的基础，一个新的关系基础，一种对工作和健康的新态度，我们称之为你生命的四大支柱——关系、工作、健康和精神进步——所有这些共同建立起来是为了给你一个更伟大的基础，这样当你的突破到来时，你将能够拥抱它们。你将能够跨越等待你的伟大门槛。</p>
<p>This is the promise of the preparation in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. This is the result of following and applying the Steps to Knowledge. This is the result of having a spiritual practice that comes from God rather than a personal invention of someone.</p>
<p>这是大社区内识之路的准备承诺。这是遵循和运用内识进阶的结果。这是拥有来自上帝而非某人个人发明的精神练习的结果。</p>
<p>This is the great promise that is awaiting you. And all the powers that are true in Heaven and Earth are here to encourage you and to support you so that you can fulfill what you came here to do—to become a man or woman of Knowledge, or Spirit, to engage in the Greater Community of your life, and to learn to gain your freedom and to encourage others to do the same.</p>
<p>这是正在等待你的伟大承诺。天国和地球上所有的真正力量都在此鼓励你、支持你，这样你就能实现你来此要做的事情——成为一个有内识或精神的男人或女人，参与你生命的大社区，学习获得你的自由并鼓励他人也这么做。</p>
<p>All the promise for humanity in every field of endeavor, the promise for humanity to become a free and unified race within the Greater Community of life, all depends upon this fundamental association, this reunion that We are speaking of—this reunion, this marriage, between the mind that you think with and the greater Mind of Knowledge that lives within you.</p>
<p>人类在各个事业领域中的所有承诺，人类在生命大社区中成为一个自由统一种族的承诺，全都取决于这种根本的联系，取决于我们所说的这种团聚——取决于你用来思考的心灵和你内在的更伟大内识心灵之间的这种团聚、这种婚姻。</p>
