<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on September 30, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 9 月 30 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In discovering your greater purpose in life, and in building your connection to the deeper Knowledge that God has placed within you and that holds this greater purpose for you, there are certain things that you must avoid, certain behaviors and involvements, intentions and desires that will prove to be very dangerous for you and will undermine, and even destroy, your greater promise in being in the world at this time.</p>
<p>在发现你生命的更伟大目的时，在建立你与上帝放置在你内在并为你承载着这个更伟大宗旨的更深层次内识的联接时，有些事情你必须避免，某些行为和参与、意图和渴望将对你来说非常危险，并将损害、甚至摧毁你此时身处世界上的更伟大承诺。</p>
<p>The world is a hazardous place. It is a dangerous place. It is a beautiful place. And it is the appropriate place for you to be. But because of its many hazards, both its physical hazards and the many seductions that exist within the human environment, one must proceed with great caution, discernment and discretion.</p>
<p>这个世界是一个危险的地方。它是一个危险的地方。它是一个美丽的地方。它是适合你的地方。但是因为它的诸多危险，既有物理上的危险，也有人类环境中存在的诸多诱惑，一个人必须非常谨慎、明辨是非和谨慎地前行。</p>
<p>There are many attractions in this world that are extremely dangerous and counterproductive. While they may seem to produce pleasure and benefit at the outset, they betray one’s relationship with oneself. They betray one’s deeper conscience, a conscience that has been established by God. And they can truly ruin one’s life and compromise one’s life to the point where you truly become a stranger to yourself. Having taken so many wrong turns, having made so many wrong decisions, now it seems almost impossible to find your way back.</p>
<p>这个世界有许多极其危险和适得其反的诱惑。虽然它们一开始似乎能带来快乐和益处，但它们却背叛了一个人与自己的关系。它们背叛了一个人内心更深层次的良知，而这种良知是由上帝建立的。它们真的可以毁掉一个人的生命，危及一个人的生命，让你真正变得对你自己陌生。走过如此多的弯路，做出如此多错误的决定，现在它看起来，几乎不可能再找到回去的路。</p>
<p>You will find redemption eventually, either in this life or beyond, but time here can be equated with suffering, and suffering is largely the result of people’s decisions and unwillingness or inability to follow the deeper Knowledge that God has placed within them.</p>
<p>你最终将找到救赎，无论是在今生还是来世，但此生的时间可以等同于苦难，而苦难很大程度上是由于人们的决定以及不愿或无力遵循上帝放置在他们内在的更深层次内识的结果。</p>
<p>This deeper Knowledge is not discerned in the realm of the intellect. It exists beyond the intellect because it represents the permanent part of your nature, your deeper nature, the deeper nature that has been created by God.</p>
<p>这个更深层次的内识并非在智力领域中被辨识。它存在于智力之外，因为它代表着你自然的永恒部分，你的更深层次的自然，被上帝创造的更深层次的自然。</p>
<p>God has given you a deeper conscience. This conscience exists beyond your social conditioning, or a social conscience. Your family and your culture and your environment growing up have inculcated into you a certain kind of social conscience—proper behavior, proper manners, following rules, guidelines and so forth—established by your family, culture, and perhaps your religion. But God has placed a deeper conscience within you that is not bound by these things.</p>
<p>上帝赋予了你更深层次的良知。这种良知超越了你的社会条件或社会良知。你的家庭、文化和成长环境向你灌输了某种社会良知——得体的行为、得体的举止、遵守规则、指导方针等等——这些良知是由你的家庭、文化，甚至可能是你的宗教所建立的。但上帝在你的内心放置了一种更深层次的良知，它不受这些事物的束缚。</p>
<p>When you go against your deeper conscience, you feel bad, and if you continue in this way, you will feel disconnected from yourself. Because this disconnection is so disconcerting and produces so much suffering, you begin to build an identity outside yourself. You make compromises, you adjust your thinking, you find excuses and validation from others, and then really you are living a life that is not authentic; it is a life not based on who you are.</p>
<p>当你违背内心更深层次的良知时，你会感到难过，如果你继续这样下去，你会感到与你自己脱离。由于这种脱离令人不安，并带来许多痛苦，你开始在你自己之外建立一种身份。你做出妥协，调整思维，从他人那里寻找借口和认可，然后你真的过着一种不真实的生命；这种生命不是基于你是谁。</p>
<p>Then you can be persuaded to do almost anything. Because you are suffering now and feel disconnected from your Source and your deeper Self, now you can be persuaded to pursue happiness and pleasure and wealth, beauty, charm and personal advantage. And you can be persuaded to do this in such a way that it further distances you from your deeper nature.</p>
<p>然后，你几乎可以被说服去做任何事情。因为你现在很痛苦，感觉与你的本源和你更深层次的自我脱离，所以你现在可以被说服去追求幸福、快乐、财富、美丽、魅力和个人利益。而且，你可以被说服去做这些事情，从而进一步远离你的更深层次的自然。</p>
<p>This compounds your problem and leads you further astray, further away from the center and the source of yourself. Now you are becoming a kind of aberrant personality. You are creating an identity and an experience that is foreign to your deeper nature.</p>
<p>这会使你的问题更加复杂，使你更加误入歧途，远离你自己的中心和本源。现在你正在成为一种异常的人格。你正在创造一种与你更深层次自然格格不入的身份和体验。</p>
<p>Everyone has done this to a certain degree because they have not yet realized and experienced the power and the presence of Knowledge within them. But this disassociation can be taken to extremes, leading to addiction, eccentricity and even criminal activity.</p>
<p>每个人都在一定程度上这样做过，因为他们还没有意识到并体验到他们内在内识的力量和存在。但这种分离可能会走向极端，导致成瘾、怪异甚至犯罪活动。</p>
<p>People can become so distorted and so removed from their deeper nature that they become almost like caricatures. In the extreme, this is utterly tragic. But even moderate expressions of this disassociation are truly unfortunate because it leads to continual suffering.</p>
<p>人们可以变得如此扭曲，如此远离他们更深层次的自然，以至于他们几乎变成了漫画人物。在极端情况下，这是非常悲惨的。但即使是这种分离的温和表现也是非常不幸的，因为它会导致持续的痛苦。</p>
<p>If you are a stranger to yourself, you cannot feel the deeper current of Knowledge within yourself, you cannot respond to the wisdom and guidance that Knowledge is providing to you, and you do not really know how to be with other people because being a stranger with yourself means that you are a stranger with others. As a result, you adapt your social behavior and your perception to meet a distorted reality within yourself. And it is truly difficult, and sometimes impossible, to establish a meaningful relationship with anyone else from such a distorted and estranged position.</p>
<p>如果你对你自己陌生，你就无法感受到你内在更深层次内识的潮流，你就无法回应内识提供给你的智慧和指导，你就无法真正知道如何与他人相处，因为对你自己陌生意味着你对他人也是陌生。结果，你调整你的社交行为和你的感知来应对你内在扭曲的现实。从这样一个扭曲和疏远的立场与任何其他人建立有意义的关系确实非常困难，有时甚至是不可能的。</p>
<p>You might have many acquaintances, you might share interests with many people, but no one knows who you are. You do not know who you are. You are kind of living out a set of beliefs and assumptions, living a kind of fantasy and distorted life, lost to yourself, unable to really connect with others.</p>
<p>你可能有许多熟人，你可能和许多人有共同的兴趣，但没有人知道你是谁。你不知道你是谁。你生活在一套信念和假设中，过着一种幻想和扭曲的生命，迷失了你自己，无法真正与他人建立联系。</p>
<p>For the truth is if you are not intimate with yourself, how can you be truly intimate with anyone else? If you are not close to who you are and to your deeper nature, how can you really be close to anyone else? As a result, there is a great distance within yourself, and between you and others. And while you might take advantage of them, or allow them to take advantage of you, you are really alone, isolated within your own mind.</p>
<p>因为真理是，如果你不与你自己亲密，你怎么能与他人真正亲密？如果你不接近你自己和你更深层次的自然，你怎么能与他人真正亲密？结果，你内心以及你与他人之间存在着巨大的距离。虽然你可能会利用他们，或者允许他们利用你，但你实际上是孤独的，孤立在你自身的心灵中。</p>
<p>Underneath this is a current of guilt for all the wrong decisions you have made, all your regrets, all the actions you have taken that have gone against your deeper nature. And with this guilt, there is lack of self-acceptance, and from this emerges condemnation of others, intolerance of others and the projection of blame and hatred.</p>
<p>在这之下，是对你做出的所有错误决定、所有遗憾、所有违背你内心更深层次自然行为的愧疚之流。而这种愧疚感导致缺乏自我接受，由此产生对他人的谴责、对他人的不宽容以及责备和仇恨的投射。</p>
<p>This really is a kind of mental illness that permeates every culture, and is even common in the Greater Community of worlds, of life in the universe. It is the fundamental result of Separation from God and from the deeper nature that God has placed within all sentient beings.</p>
<p>这确实是一种渗透到每一种文化中的心理疾病，甚至在宇宙大社区中、在宇宙生命中也很常见。这是与上帝分离、与上帝放置在所有众生内心的更深层次自然分离的根本结果。</p>
<p>God has healed the Separation by placing Knowledge within all sentient beings—Knowledge that is like a beacon and a compass, a honing mechanism, guiding you into greater and more meaningful action in relationships in the world, bringing your life into harmony and focus, and re-engaging your thinking mind with the deeper Mind that God has created, which represents your true Self and identity.</p>
<p>上帝通过将内识放置在所有有情众生之内而治愈了分离——内识就像一盏灯塔、一个指南针、一个磨练机制，引导你在世间各种关系中采取更伟大、更有意义的行动，让你的生命和谐而专注，让你的思维重新融入上帝创造的更深层次的心灵之中，这代表着你的真正自我和身份。</p>
<p>All suffering emanates from this Separation. Even physical suffering due to deprivation of food or security, still reflects your reality living in Separation. And while this deprivation can be corrected, and must be corrected, concerning the impoverished and the oppressed peoples everywhere in the world, there is a more fundamental problem that generates suffering. It is the suffering born of disassociation from yourself and from others.</p>
<p>所有的痛苦都源于这种分离。即使是由于缺乏食物或安全而导致的身体痛苦，也仍然反映了你生活在分离中的现实。虽然这种匮乏可以得到纠正，也必须得到纠正，但对于世界各地贫困和受压迫的人民来说，还有一个更根本的问题导致了苦难。它就是与你自己和他人分离而产生的痛苦。</p>
<p>To be truly alone and isolated really is to live in Hell. You can imagine a more hellish physical state, a state of torment and persecution, but what Hell really is is living in a profound isolation, walled off from yourself, walled off from others, walled off from the ability to experience and appreciate life, to experience love and affinity, compassion, forgiveness. Here you are in a prison of your own creation and the creation of others around you.</p>
<p>真正的孤独和孤立无援，真的就像生活在地狱里。你可以想象一种更地狱般的身体状态，一种折磨和迫害的状态，但真正的地狱是生活在深深的孤立中，与你自己隔绝，与他人隔绝，与体验和欣赏生命、体验爱和亲和力、同情和宽恕的能力隔绝。在这里，你处在你自己和周围其他人创造的监狱里。</p>
<p>Suffering is profound; it is everywhere. Do not deny its reality. Do not deny its reality within yourself, pretending that you are happy, affirming all the good things in life to try to convince yourself that you are really happier than you truly are.</p>
<p>痛苦是深刻的，无处不在。不要否认痛苦的现实。不要否认痛苦在你内心的存在，假装你自己是快乐的，来肯定生命中所有美好的事物，试图说服你自己，你比实际更快乐。</p>
<p>Being happy is not just an attitude; it is not just an affirmation. For while you may emphasize all the good things in your life, there is still the problem of Separation within yourself. There is still the disassociation from your Source, and from your deeper nature.</p>
<p>快乐不只是一种态度；也不只是一种肯定。因为尽管你可能强调生命中所有美好的事物，但你内心仍然存在分离的问题。你与你的本源、与你更深层次的自然仍然存在分离。</p>
<p>You can make a happy appearance in the world, you can pretend that you are happy and carefree, but until you have bridged the gap within yourself, until your thinking mind and the deeper Mind of Knowledge have built a strong connection, until you are being guided and directed by Knowledge, you are still in a state of suffering.</p>
<p>你可以在世界上表现出快乐的样子，你可以假装你是快乐的、无忧无虑的，但除非你弥合了你自己内心的鸿沟，除非你的思维心灵和更深层次的内识心灵建立了强大的连接，除非你受到内识的指导和指引，否则你仍然处于痛苦的状态。</p>
<p>Do not deny this or cover it up, for to do so is to deny the redemption that God has placed within you. You will look elsewhere for resolution. You will try to have wealth and pleasure, comfort and security, but you are not really meeting the problem where it truly exists. You are only building an appearance of success.</p>
<p>不要否认或掩盖这一点，因为这样做就是否认上帝赋予你的救赎。你会在别处寻找解决方案。你会努力拥有财富和快乐、舒适和安全，但你并没有真正面对真正存在的问题。你只是在营造一种成功的假象。</p>
<p>God has given you Knowledge to redeem you, to protect you, to give you a foundation for integrity and to restore to you your deeper conscience. God has done this to also give you greater gifts to give to a world in need, under the very circumstances that you can see and experience today.</p>
<p>上帝已经赋予你内识，以救赎你、保护你、赋予你完整性的基础并重建你更深层次的良知。上帝这样做也是为了赋予你更伟大的礼物，以奉献给一个需要的世界，就在你今天能够看到和体验的境况下。</p>
<p>This is a kind of practical redemption. It is not simply that you are blessed with Grace, and all of your difficulties, your conflicts and your hostility melt away. God redeems you by giving you something important to do in life. And what God has given you to do in life is very likely quite different from what you are attempting to accomplish now.</p>
<p>这是一种实际的救赎。它不仅仅是你被赐予恩典，你的所有困难、冲突和敌意都消失了。上帝通过让你在生命中做一些重要的事情来救赎你。而上帝让你在生命中做的事情很可能与你现在试图完成的事情大不相同。</p>
<p>Only very few people in the world are really engaged in their greater purpose here. And that is why suffering is so endemic. That is why it is ever present and all around you—infecting the poor, infecting the rich and everyone in between.</p>
<p>世界上只有极少数人真正投入到他们在此的更伟大目的中。正因为如此，痛苦才如此普遍。正因为如此，它始终存在并且围绕着你——感染穷人、感染富人以及介于两者之间的每个人。</p>
<p>While you can alleviate deprivation in your outer circumstances, the only way to alleviate deprivation within yourself is to take the Steps to Knowledge, to reconnect with the deeper Mind that God has given you and your deeper conscience that will tell you what is right and wrong, that will restrain you from giving yourself to people, places or things that have no future and no success. It will keep you from addiction; it will keep you from harmful activities.</p>
<p>虽然你可以减轻外在环境的匮乏，但减轻你内心匮乏的唯一方法是开展内识的进阶，重新与上帝赋予你的更深层次心灵和更深层次的良知建立联系，它会告诉你什么是对的，什么是错的，它会约束你不把你自己交给那些没有未来、不能成功的人、地方或事物。它会阻止你上瘾；它会阻止你从事有害的活动。</p>
<p>The more grounded you are in Knowledge, the harder it will be for you to make a mistake, and the more you will be able to see problems before they arise. The practical value of this is immense and incalculable. And it also allows you to prepare for difficulties coming over the horizon—the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world, the great environmental problems and resource problems that humanity is now beginning to experience, and which will accelerate and increase in the future.</p>
<p>你的内识越扎实，你就越不容易犯错，你就越能在问题出现之前看到它们。这一点的实用价值是巨大的，无法估量的。它还能让你为即将到来的困难做好准备——正在降临世界的变革巨浪，人类现在开始经历的、并将在未来加速和加剧的巨大环境问题和资源问题。</p>
<p>The power and the importance of Knowledge cannot be underestimated. The invisible and the ineffable here have the greatest power, greater than any physical force, greater than any social convention, greater than any wealth or political power. For God has created something pure and wise within you. If it is neglected, if it is denied, if it is violated, it will only produce suffering and confusion, and this will make self-acceptance and acceptance of others impossible.</p>
<p>内识的力量和重要性不容低估。这里，无形和不可言喻的内识拥有最伟大的力量，比任何物理力量、任何社会习俗、任何财富或政治权力都要强大。因为上帝在你内在创造了一种纯粹和明智的内识。如果它被忽视、如果它被否定、如果它被侵犯，它只会产生痛苦和困惑，这将使自我接受和接受他人变得不可能。</p>
<p>There are things you must do and not do, as a general rule and guideline:</p>
<p>作为一般规则和指导方针，有些事情你必须做，有些事情你不能做：</p>
<p>1. Do not give yourself to people until you have discovered and experienced your deeper purpose and direction in life. For anyone that you give yourself to, that relationship will be placed in jeopardy should you have the great opportunity to discern and experience your greater purpose. Here people, to protect their previous investment in relationships, will avoid real self-honesty and self-awareness because they sense and realize it could threaten all of their current engagements, all of their investment in relationship and security.</p>
<p>1. 在你发现并体验到你生命中更深层次的目的和方向之前，不要把你自己交给任何人。对于任何你把你自己交给的人，如果你有机会辨别和体验你的更伟大目的，那么这种关系就会处于危险之中。在这里，人们为了保护他们之前在关系中的投资，会避免真正的自我诚实和自我觉知，因为他们感觉到并意识到这可能会威胁到他们目前的所有参与，以及他们在关系和安全上的所有投资。</p>
<p>Do not give your life to another until you have found your life or you will have to risk everything in discovering your deeper nature. It is better to be alone and lonely, within a social context, than to build an entire life built around convenience and the expectation of others, only to have to threaten all of that investment later on when you begin to realize that you have a greater purpose for being in the world.</p>
<p>在你找到你的生命之前，不要将你的生命交给另一个人，否则你将不得不冒着一切风险去发现你更深层次的自然。在社交环境中孤独一人总比为了方便和他人的期望而建立整个生命要好，而当你开始意识到你在这个世界上有更伟大的目的时，你不得不威胁到所有的投资。</p>
<p>You can see the dramatic consequences of this unwise investment everywhere around you. People are disconnected from Knowledge, they are strangers to themselves and so they become part of social structures that define them. And yet they are lost within themselves; they have no sense of real direction in their lives; they have lost their connection to deep happiness; they are suffering.</p>
<p>你可以在周围任何地方看到这种不明智投资的严重后果。人们与内识脱节，对他们自己感到陌生，因此他们成为定义他们的社会结构的一部分。然而他们迷失了他们自己；在他们的生命中没有真正的方向感；他们失去了与深层幸福的连接；他们正在受苦。</p>
<p>And though they may work slavishly for their families or their community, they are suffering with no relief in sight. To try to find relief, they will become involved in addictive behaviors. They will give themselves to political causes or religious extremism to try to find an avenue to express their confusion and frustration.</p>
<p>尽管他们可能为了家庭或社区而拼命工作，但他们仍然饱受痛苦折磨，看不到任何缓解的迹象。为了寻求解脱，他们会沉迷于上瘾行为。他们会投身于政治事业或宗教极端主义，试图找到一种渠道来表达他们的困惑和沮丧。</p>
<p>Therefore, the first Guideline is: Do not give your life to anyone or anything until you have really discovered the deeper current of Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>因此，第一条准则是：在你真正发现你内心更深层次的内识潮流之前，不要把你的生命托付给任何人或任何事。</p>
<p>2. The second Guideline is: Look out into the world to see what events or crises or circumstances have the greatest impact upon you. What is it out there that either upsets or delights you extremely?</p>
<p>2. 第二条指导原则是：放眼世界，看看哪些事件、危机或情况对你影响最大。有哪些事情让你极度沮丧或高兴？</p>
<p>Here you are not finding an answer, but a clue. If there is something in the world around you that is speaking to your deeper nature particularly, beyond the normal range of stimulation and excitement, or disgust or condemnation, if there is something really speaking to your deeper nature, you must give this attention, remembering that you have not found an answer, but instead a clue.</p>
<p>在这里，你不是在寻找答案，而是在寻找线索。如果你周围的世界里有什么事情特别地触动了你更深层次的自然，超出了正常的刺激和兴奋、厌恶或谴责的范围，如果有什么真的触动了你更深层次的自然，你就必须给予关注，记住你不是在寻找答案，而是在寻找线索。</p>
<p>For the truth is that the answer is within you, but the calling is out in the world. The world calls your greater purpose out of you. Important relationships call your greater purpose out of you. But these are relationships that are not based upon romance or indulgence, or the acquisition of wealth and power.</p>
<p>因为真理是：答案就在你的内心，但召唤却在外面的世界。世界召唤你去实现更伟大的目的。重要的关系召唤你去实现更伟大的目的。但这些关系并非建立在浪漫或放纵，或获取财富和权力的基础上。</p>
<p>You can build a whole life based upon the acquisition of power and wealth, but this will likely have nothing to do with who you are and what you are really meant to do here. So it is all a lie, you see. Even if you are successful, you are only successful at cheating yourself. It is better that you fail in this attempt and be thrown back upon yourself to re-evaluate your deeper inclinations.</p>
<p>你可以通过获得权力和财富来建立自己的一生，但这可能与你是谁以及你真正应该做什么无关。所以你看，这都是谎言。即使你成功了，你也只是在欺骗你自己。你最好在这次尝试中失败，然后重新审视你自己，重新评估你更深层次的倾向。</p>
<p>The world will give you clues and signs that will tell you about your deeper nature because it will stimulate a deeper response within you. Just make a note of those things that have the greatest impact, whether it be positive or negative. It is the depth of your response that is important here. These are clues.</p>
<p>世界会给你线索和迹象，来告诉你关于你更深层次的自然，因为它会刺激你内心更深层次的回应。只要记下那些影响最大的事，无论是积极的还是消极的。你回应的深度在这里很重要。这些都是线索。</p>
<p>3. The third Guideline is: Do not become sexually engaged with other people until you have really found someone who is connected to your deeper purpose. Never think of sexuality in terms of recreation, for sexuality represents a deeper engagement between people, and if it is used for casual purposes, if it is used to manipulate others for your own pleasure, then you are betraying the reality of your deeper relationship with other people. You are also playing recklessly with nature, forcing people to compromise themselves, forcing you to compromise yourself.</p>
<p>3. 第三条准则是：在你真正找到与你更深层次目的相关的人之前，不要与其他人发生性关系。永远不要把性当作消遣，因为性代表着人与人之间更深层次的交往，如果性被用于随意目的，如果性被用于为你自身的快乐而操纵他人，那么你就背叛了你与他人更深层次关系的现实。你也在肆无忌惮地玩弄自然，迫使人们妥协，迫使你自己妥协。</p>
<p>You may live in a culture and a society that promotes this kind of sexual adventurism, but it is highly destructive to people’s integrity. It undermines their sense of self-worth. It cheapens life. And it leads people to all manner of deception, both within themselves and between themselves and others.</p>
<p>你可能生活在一个提倡这种性冒险的文化和社会中，但它对人们的完整性是极具破坏性的。它破坏了他们的自我价值感。它贬低了生命。它导致人们进行各种欺骗，无论是在他们自己内部还是在他们自己与其他人之间。</p>
<p>Sexual engagement is appropriate in a relationship that represents a greater union. It is appropriate and wonderful within this context. But first, you must discern the greater movement and reality of your life. This should be the primary focus for all young people, and should be a primary focus for older people who are re-evaluating their lives and their priorities. Inappropriate sexual engagement will draw your psychic energy; it will dominate your emotions; it will lead you into great confusion and self-estrangement. It carries with it such a great cost—a little pleasure, at such a great cost.</p>
<p>在代表更伟大结合的关系中，性接触是恰当的。在这种背景下，性接触是恰当的、美妙的。但首先，你必须辨别你生命中更伟大的运动和现实。这应该是所有年轻人的主要关注点，也应该是正在重新评估他们的生命和优先事项的老年人的主要关注点。不恰当的性接触会消耗你的精神能量；它会主宰你的情感；它会把你带入巨大的困惑和自我疏远。它会带来如此巨大的代价——如此巨大的代价换来的是一点点快乐。</p>
<p>Better to be alone than to be inappropriately engaged with others. So much better this is. For when you are alone, you can work on your spiritual practice. You can build the Four Pillars of your life: the Pillar of Relationships, the Pillar of Work, the Pillar of Health and the Pillar of Spiritual Development. You can invest in building these Pillars, which represent the true stability and strength of your existence here.</p>
<p>独处总比与他人不恰当地交往要好。这样好得多。因为当你独处时，你可以进行你的精神练习。你可以建立你生命的四大支柱：关系支柱、工作支柱、健康支柱和精神发展支柱。你可以投资建设这些支柱，它们代表了你在这里存在的真正稳定性和力量。</p>
<p>Better to be alone than inappropriately engaged with others. Do not be seduced by wealth, beauty or charm in this regard, or you will give your life away for nothing. You will commit your youth and your most productive years in a pursuit that has no reward, no future and no possibility of success.</p>
<p>独处总比与他人不恰当地交往要好。在这方面，不要被财富、美貌或魅力所诱惑，否则你将白白浪费你的生命。你将把你的青春和最富有成效的岁月投入到没有回报、没有未来、没有成功可能性的追求中。</p>
<p>This abstinence is not merely a matter of restraint; it is really a matter of self-respect. It is respecting one’s life and one’s time and one’s opportunities in life. It is your self-respect that keeps you from giving your life away. It is your recognition that you are here for a greater purpose that will hold you back from giving yourself to other purposes that seem to be promising and alluring in the moment, but which really offer nothing in the future but suffering and disappointment.</p>
<p>这种禁欲不仅仅是一种克制，而是一种真正的自尊。它尊重一个人的生命、时间和生命机遇。正是你的自我尊重阻止你不要放弃你的生命。正是你认识到你来此是为了一个更伟大的目的，阻止你把你自己交给其他目的，这些目的在当下看似充满承诺和诱惑，但实际上除了痛苦和失望之外什么也带不来。</p>
<p>4. The fourth Guideline: Who you are is not your mind; it is not your beliefs; it is not your attitudes and emotions even. All of your thinking and your associations and assumptions, your insecurity and your identification with people, places and things—that is all at the surface of your mind, the turbulent surface, like the surface of the ocean which is swept by the winds and the weather.</p>
<p>4. 第四条指导原则：你是谁，并不取决于你的心灵；也不取决于你的信仰；甚至也不取决于你的态度和情感。你所有的思维、联想和假设、你的不安全感以及你对人、地方和事物的认同——都存在于你心灵的表面，动荡的表面，就像被疾风和天气席卷的海洋表面。</p>
<p>You have a deeper nature that is wise and profound. It is not subject to all of the seductions and movements of the world around you. It is quiet, it is deep, it is profound, it is discerning, it is still. It is not debating, it is not trying to make decisions, it is not in conflict with itself, it is not trying to accommodate other people’s expectations or demands.</p>
<p>你拥有一种更深层次的自然，它智慧而深邃。它不受周围世界所有诱惑和运动的影响。它安静、深沉、深刻、敏锐、宁静。它不争论、不试图做出决定、不与它自己发生冲突、不试图迎合他人的期望或要求。</p>
<p>Yet this deeper Mind is incapable of condemnation and violence, self-hatred, or hatred of others. None of this exists at this deeper level—this deeper nature within you.</p>
<p>然而，这种更深层次的心灵是无法谴责和暴力，自我憎恨或仇恨他人的。这些都不存在于这个更深层次的层面上——你内在的这个更深层次的自然。</p>
<p>Your mind has been your master, but it must now become your servant. Your mind has enslaved you, you who believe that you are your thoughts, feelings and ideas. But this mind is meant to serve you as a vehicle of communication in the world. For without this mind, you could not speak to others, you could not understand other people’s circumstances, you could not relate to people. You would not have perception, you would not have sensory awareness, you could not interpret the world around you.</p>
<p>你的心灵已经是你的主人，但现在它必须成为你的仆人。你的心灵奴役了你，你相信你就是你的思想、感觉和想法。但这个心灵本应成为你与世界沟通的媒介。因为没有这个心灵，你就无法与其他人交谈，无法理解其他人的处境，无法与人们产生共鸣。你将没有感知，没有感官觉知，无法解读你周围的世界。</p>
<p>This mind must be a servant, not a master. For the master is Knowledge within you, because that is what God has placed within you to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to a greater life.</p>
<p>这个心灵必须是一位服务者，而不是一位主人。因为主人是你内在的内识，因为内识是上帝放置在你内在的心灵，用来指导你、保护你并引领你走向更伟大的生命。</p>
<p>5. The fifth Guideline is: You must take the Steps to Knowledge, building a connection between your surface mind where you live and where you identify yourself, to your deeper nature and to the greater purpose that it holds for you.</p>
<p>5. 第五条指导原则是：你必须开展内识的进阶，在你生活的表面心灵和你自己认同的地方，与你更深层次的自然以及它为你承载的更伟大目的之间建立一种连接。</p>
<p>There are many pathways to Knowledge, but most of these pathways are secret and hard to find. They do not represent the public spiritual teaching that you see everywhere around you, where people are trying to live according to precepts or guidelines, or certain kinds of practices alone.</p>
<p>通往内识的道路有很多，但大多数都是秘密的，很难找到。它们并不代表你在周围随处可见的公共精神教导，在那里，人们努力按照戒律或准则生活，或仅仅按照某种做法进行生活。</p>
<p>The journey to Knowledge is deeper and more profound. Humanity has only discovered this reality to a very limited degree. But it is available to all, whether they be rich or poor, in every faith tradition, in every country, in every culture. Real teachers here are hard to find, though they exist in every country. They are not the popular teachers on the television. They are not the teachers who have great crowds coming to them to hear their sermons and admonitions.</p>
<p>通向内识的旅程是更加深刻和深远的。人类只在非常有限的程度上发现了这个现实。但它对所有人都是开放的，无论他们是富人还是穷人，在每一个信仰传统中，在每一个国家，在每一个文化中。真正的老师在这里很难找到，尽管他们在每个国家都有。他们不是电视上受欢迎的老师。他们不是那些有大批人群来听他们布道和劝诫的老师。</p>
<p>It is because of this that the Creator of all life has sent a preparation into the world, so that people from all walks of life can practice The Way of Knowledge and can take the Steps to Knowledge on their own.</p>
<p>正因为如此，所有生命的创造者才向世界发送了一种准备工作，以便各行各业的人们能够修习内识之路，都能迈出他们自身的内识步骤。</p>
<p>This preparation is becoming available to everyone. It is pure. It is uncorrupted by human governments and human cultures. It has not been tampered with. It has not been compromised. It has not been adulterated. It has not been wed to other things that are unrelated to it. It represents a pure pathway.</p>
<p>这种准备正在向所有人开放。它是纯净的。它没有被人类政府和人类文化所腐蚀。它没有被篡改。它没有被妥协。它没有被掺假。它没有与其他不相关的事情相结合。它代表着一条纯净的道路。</p>
<p>For if you cannot find a true teacher to guide you and teach you the Way to Knowledge, then you can receive the Steps to Knowledge that the Creator of all life has sent to the world to prepare humanity for its future, to prepare humanity for the Great Waves of change coming to the world and to prepare humanity for its encounter with intelligent life in the universe, an encounter that will change and shape the future and destiny of humanity. You must have a pathway to Knowledge. That is essential.</p>
<p>因为如果你找不到一位真正的老师来指导你、教导你内识之路，那么你可以接收所有生命的创造者发送给世界的内识进阶，以便让人类为它的未来进行准备，让人类为即将降临世界的变革巨浪进行准备，让人类为它与宇宙智能生命的相遇进行准备，这个相遇将改变和塑造人类的未来和天命。你必须拥有一条通向内识的道路。这是至关重要的。</p>
<p>6. The next Guideline is: Build the Four Pillars of your life, the Pillar of Relationships, the Pillar of Work, the Pillar of Health and the Pillar of Spiritual Development. Like the four legs of a table, they uphold your life. And your life is only as stable and as strong as the weakest of these Pillars.</p>
<p>6. 下一条指导原则是：建立你生命的四大支柱，即关系支柱、工作支柱、健康支柱和精神发展支柱。就像桌子的四条腿一样，它们支撑着你的生命。你的生命只有最薄弱的支柱才能稳定和强大。</p>
<p>If you look at the world around you, you will see that people give themselves to one thing primarily. Perhaps it is their career. Perhaps it is their relationships. Perhaps they are obsessed with their health and their beauty or their illness. Or perhaps they have given themselves entirely to spiritual practice and study.</p>
<p>如果你观察周围的世界，你会发现人们主要把他们自己交给一件事。也许是他们的事业。也许是他们的人际关系。也许他们痴迷于他们的健康、美丽或疾病。或者他们把他们自己完全交给精神实践和精神学习。</p>
<p>But in all of these cases, people’s lives are inherently very unstable and can be easily undermined by their lack of focus on the other Pillars of their life. To work on all four of your Pillars means you cannot be eccentric or extreme in any one of them. This creates a moderation in life and an essential balance.</p>
<p>但在所有这些情况下，人们的生命本质上是非常不稳定的，很容易因缺乏对生命其他支柱的关注而受到破坏。努力实现所有四个支柱意味着你不能在其中任何一个支柱上表现得古怪或极端。这创造了生命的节制和必要的平衡。</p>
<p>Being in life is like being at sea—constantly changing, facing extreme events beyond your control, one day a quiet sea, the next day turbulent, even violent. You must have a very strong craft to sail this ocean. You must have a very stable and strong craft to take you where you need to go in life.</p>
<p>人生就像在海上——不断变化，面临无法控制的极端事件，今天是平静的大海，明天就变得动荡不安，甚至狂暴。你必须有一艘非常坚固的船才能航行在这片海洋上。你必须有一艘非常稳定和坚固的船才能带你去生命需要去的地方。</p>
<p>That is why all the Pillars must be built. You must have solid relationships based upon Knowledge and recognition, purpose and meaning. You must have meaningful work that does not betray or replace your greater purpose for being in the world. Within this Pillar of Work you must handle money and resources appropriately and wisely, serving the moment and preparing for the future.</p>
<p>正因为如此，所有支柱都必须被建立。你必须拥有基于内识的关系、认知的关系、目的的关系和意义稳固的关系。你必须拥有有意义的工作，不会背叛或取代你身处世界的更伟大目的。在这个工作支柱里，你必须恰当而明智地处理金钱和资源，服务于当下并为未来做好准备。</p>
<p>You must have a solid basis of physical and mental health to be able to participate in a greater way in life, and you must have a spiritual practice that enables you to build your connection with Knowledge and to learn a greater wisdom and discernment in life.</p>
<p>你必须拥有坚实的身心健康基础，这样才能够以一种更伟大的方式参与生命，你必须拥有一种精神实践，这让你能够建立你和内识的联接，并在生命中学习一种更伟大智慧和辨别力。</p>
<p>The New Message that God has sent into the world teaches about the Four Pillars of life and The Way of Knowledge. It gives you a very clear and very important insight and understanding here. And this will teach you how you can use your time to the greatest benefit and how you can direct your energy to the greatest effect.</p>
<p>上帝向世界发送的新讯息教导了生命的四大支柱和内识之路。它在这里给予你非常清晰和非常重要的洞察力和理解。它将教导你如何最大程度地使用你的时间，如何最大程度来引导你的能量。</p>
<p>7. The next Guideline is to understand that humanity is facing the Great Waves of change—resource depletion, violent weather, environmental degradation, growing political and economic instability and the risk of war. Humanity, due to its overuse and abuse of the world, has set in motion converging forces that will create a confusing and complex array of impacts and influences.</p>
<p>7. 下一个指导原则是理解人类正面临变革的巨浪——资源枯竭、恶劣天气、环境恶化、政治和经济的不稳定加剧以及战争的风险。由于人类对世界的过度使用和滥用，人类已经启动了汇聚的力量，这些力量将产生一系列令人困惑和复杂的影响。</p>
<p>You must face this. Already your deeper feelings are telling you that something important is coming, that great change is on the horizon. Yet people are unprepared and do not know how to prepare. They do not know what they will need to do in the face of these Great Waves of change. And that is why God has sent a New Message into the world, to provide a warning, a blessing and a preparation, a preparation beyond what humanity can establish for itself.</p>
<p>你必须面对这一点。你内心深处的感受已经在告诉你，某个重要的事情即将到来，这个伟大的变革即将来临。然而人们却没有做好准备，也不知道如何做好准备。他们不知道如何面对这些变革巨浪，他们需要做什么。正因为如此，上帝向世界发送了一条新的讯息，提供一个警告、一个祝福和一个准备，一个超越人类为它自己所能建立的准备。</p>
<p>All the signs of the world are telling you that great change is upon you. Do not blame others, do not blame governments. Everyone has produced this. Everyone is involved in its creation. And everyone must become involved in its resolution. Take all the energy you put into condemnation and resentment and put it into your preparation for the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>世界上所有的迹象都在告诉你，伟大的变革即将来临。不要责怪他人，不要责怪政府。每个人都创造了这一切。每个人都参与了它的创造。每个人都必须参与解决它。把你投入到谴责和怨恨中的所有能量，都投入到为变革的巨浪做准备。</p>
<p>8. The next Guideline is to recognize that humanity is emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life in the universe. Already there is Intervention in the world from certain races who seek to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity. Their presence here is small, but it is growing. They represent resource explorers and economic collectives who will seek to take advantage of human weakness and ignorance and conflict for their own benefit. They have great skill in influencing people’s minds and perception. And in this they will seek to gain dominance here without the use of force.</p>
<p>8. 下一个指导原则是认识到人类正在步入宇宙智能生命大社区。某些种族已经对世界进行干预，他们试图利用人类的软弱和分裂。他们在这里的存在虽然不多，但它正在增长。他们代表资源勘探者和经济集体，他们将寻求利用人类的弱点、无知和冲突来为他们自己谋利。他们非常善于影响人们的心灵和感知。他们将寻求在不使用武力的情况下在这里获得统治地位。</p>
<p>Only the New Message from God can reveal the real meaning of this, the true nature of this Intervention, and how humanity must unite to resist it and to establish its own rules of engagement with intelligent life in the universe.</p>
<p>唯有来自上帝的新讯息，能够揭示这个干预的真正含义、这个干预的真正自然，以及人类必须如何团结起来抵制它并建立它自身与宇宙智能生命交往的规则。</p>
<p>You can see within these Guidelines that they represent a great spectrum, going from the center and the depth of your own inner experience, all the way out to the greater movement of life within your world, and the greater events that will shape humanity’s future and destiny.</p>
<p>你可以在这些指南中看到，它们代表了一个伟大的范围，从你自身内在体验的中心和深度，一直到你们世界中更伟大的生命运动，以及塑造人类未来和天命的更伟大事件。</p>
<p>These Guidelines are very general, of course, and will require much clarification in each case. Only a New Message from God can reveal to you what this all means, and how it is all connected, and why you are in the world at this time, and why you are designed the way you are designed, uniquely, to make a unique contribution to life.</p>
<p>当然，这些指导方针非常笼统，在每种情况下都需要大量的澄清。只有来自上帝的新讯息才能向你揭示这一切意味着什么，这一切是如何联系在一起的，你为什么在这个时候来到这个世界，为什么你被设计成这样，如此独特，为生命做出独特的贡献。</p>
<p>This is the greatest Revelation that has been given to humanity in recent times, and it will serve humanity in the times to come. For God’s Revelations are infrequent and carry great depth and meaning for those who can discern them and who can apply them in life.</p>
<p>这是近代以来人类所得到的最伟大的启示，它将在未来为人类服务。因为上帝的启示并不常见，对于那些能够辨别它们并能将它们应用于生命的人来说，它们具有深远的深度和意义。</p>
<p>You have come into the world at a great time, a time of great change, of great risk, but also great promise. You have come bearing a deeper nature and a deeper spiritual reality. You have been given a body as a physical vehicle and an intellect as a vehicle of communication, to express yourself in this world and to discern, discover and express your greater purpose and to contribute unique gifts concerning certain people and certain situations.</p>
<p>你在一个伟大的时间来到这个世界，一个充满巨大变化、巨大风险但也充满伟大承诺的时期。你带着一种更深层次的自然和一个更深层次的精神现实而来。你被赋予了一个身体作为一个物质载体和一个智力作为你的沟通载体，来到这个世界上表达你自己，来辨识、发现和表达你的更伟大目的，并为特定的人和特定的情况贡献独特的礼物。</p>
<p>Yet only Knowledge within you knows who these people are and where these situations can be found. Here the intellect must follow. Here your lesser nature, your mind and body, must serve the greater nature of your Spirit, and the power and the presence of Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>然而只有你内在的内识知道这些人是谁，以及这些情况发生在哪里。在这里，智力必须跟随。在这里，你较小的自然、你的心灵和身体必须服务于你更伟大的精神自然，以及你内在内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>In this way, you will be able to become a great light and inspiration in the world. In this way, you will be able to resist the degrading temptations that exist everywhere in human culture. In this, you will be able to discern the great change that is coming to the world and the great opportunities and necessity for human unity and cooperation.</p>
<p>通过这种方式，你将能够成为世界上的一束伟大光芒和灵感。通过这种方式，你将能够抵制人类文化中无处不在的堕落诱惑。这样，你将能够辨别世界即将发生的伟大变革，以及人类团结与合作的伟大机会和必要性。</p>
<p>Here you finally are able to no longer be a stranger to yourself or a stranger to life. And it is upon this foundation that you will be able to build relationships with others that represent the depth and the permanence of your true existence.</p>
<p>在这里，你终于能够不再对你自己或生命感到陌生。正是在此的基础之上，你将能够与他人建立关系，这些关系代表着你真正存在的深度和永恒性。</p>
