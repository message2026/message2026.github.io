<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 15, 1994 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1994 年 10 月 15 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are always preparing for the future, even if you do not think of the future. You are always preparing for the future, even if your mind is focused upon the past. This is because your life builds upon itself. What you experience today is based upon what you accomplished or did not accomplish yesterday. And what you will experience tomorrow will be partially built on what you can accomplish today. Your life is built upon the foundation of the past, and you are building the foundation for the future at this moment. This is true within your life and within all life.</p>
<p>你总是在为未来做准备，即使你没有想过未来。你总是在为未来做准备，即使你的心灵专注于过去。这是因为你的生命建立在自身之上。你今天所经历的一切是基于你昨天所完成或未完成的事情。而你明天所经历的一切将部分建立在你今天所能完成的事情之上。你的生命建立在过去的基础之上，而你此刻正在为未来奠定基础。在你的生命中，在所有的生命中，这都是真实的。</p>
<p>As you learn to become present each day, you become more aware that you are building a foundation for tomorrow for yourself and for others. Here your focus is on the present and on the future. You only draw upon the past for demonstrations and examples, for you have seen and heard much that you have not yet been able to use. The past now becomes a resource as you build the present and the future. Before this happens, the past is your focus, and the present is only bonded to the past. Here it is very hard to be present in the moment with anyone or anything, and the future is only thought of as a projection from the past. In other words, you think the future will merely be an extension of your past. This makes the future seem predictable, but in reality the future will be unlike the past, for the world is emerging into the Greater Community, and humanity is undergoing tremendous change in its societies, in its cultures, in its values and in its priorities. More and more humanity will be driven by necessity as it realizes that it must catch up with the movement of life.</p>
<p>当你学会活在当下时，你会变得更加察觉，你正在为你自己和他人的明天奠定基础。在这里，你的焦点是现在和未来。你只是从过去中汲取示范和例子，因为你已经看到和听到许多你还无法使用的事情。当你构建现在和未来时，过去现在成为一种资源。在此之前，过去是你的焦点，而现在只是与过去联系在一起。在这里，很难与任何人或任何事保持当下的关系，未来只是过去的一个投影。换句话说，你认为未来只是过去的一个延伸。这让未来看起来是可以预测的，但实际上未来与过去不同，因为世界正在走向大社区，人类正在经历社会、文化、价值观和优先事项的巨大变化。随着人类意识到必须赶上生命的运动，越来越多的人将受到必要性的驱动。</p>
<p>Knowledge provides what you need today and what you will need tomorrow. It provides this because it takes you where you need to go today and where you need to go tomorrow. It knows your direction, and it will keep you moving on if you are responsive to it. Only if you lose contact with Knowledge and substitute Knowledge with your goals and ambitions will you veer off course and find yourself again going in a direction that does not represent your real destiny.</p>
<p>内识提供你今天需要什么以及明天需要什么。它提供这些，因为它带你去你今天需要去的地方以及你明天需要去的地方。它知道你的方向，如果你对它做出回应，它会让你继续前进。只有当你失去与内识的联系，用你的目标和野心取代内识时，你才会偏离航向，发现你自己再次走向一个并不代表你真正天命的方向。</p>
<p>Today builds for tomorrow. However, life in the future is not simply a result of the past. What will happen to humanity in the future is not simply a result of what humanity did before, for humanity is not alone in the universe. Therefore, your past is not the sole factor that is determining your destiny and your evolution. Seen from a greater perspective and within a greater context, humanity is an emerging race—promising, intelligent and skillful within its own environment, but without social cohesion and without significant social development.</p>
<p>今天的建立是为了明天。然而，未来的生命并非仅仅是过去的结果。未来发生在人类身上的事情并非仅仅是人类过去所作所为的结果，因为人类在宇宙中并不孤单。因此，你们的过去并非决定你们的天命和你们进化的唯一因素。从一种更伟大的视角和一直更伟大的背景来看，人类是一个新兴种族——在它自身的环境中前途光明、聪慧和技能娴熟，但却缺乏社会凝聚力，缺乏显著的社会发展。</p>
<p>Humanity at this time is in a very precarious stage in its evolution. It is a stage that could be called a stage of adolescence. People are feeling they have greater powers available to them. They are learning new skills. They have gained what they think is dominion over their environment. They believe they are the superior race within their world and assume that their superiority will extend beyond their world into the Greater Community. Yet they do not have the cohesion, the cooperation or the accountability to one another or to the Greater Power within the world and beyond the world that they need to be a truly mature race. Adolescence is a crucial period. It is a period of many risks. You can see this within a person’s life. You can see this within the development of a society. And you can see this within the development of an entire race.</p>
<p>人类此时正处于进化的一个非常不稳定的阶段。这个阶段可以被称为青春期。人们感觉到他们拥有了更强大的力量。他们正在学习新的技能。他们获得了他们认为是对环境的统治。人类相信他们是他们世界中的优等种族，并假设他们的优越性将超越他们的世界延伸到大社区。然而人类缺乏成为一个真正成熟种族所需的凝聚力、合作或对彼此、对世界内和世界外更伟大力量的责任感。青春期是一个关键时期。它是一个充满许多风险的时期。你可以在一个人的生命中看到这一点。你可以在一个社会的发展中看到这一点。你可以在一个整个种族的发展中看到这一点。</p>
<p>Since you live in the world, you cannot yet have this perspective, but you will gain it in time as you are able to look at yourself more objectively. When you look at yourself now, you think that you are either good or bad and that your actions or thoughts are good or bad, according to a set of criteria that you have learned from your environment. But Knowledge holds a different set of criteria for determining what is good or bad. Its criteria are without condemnation. Knowledge treats everything fairly and according to its nature and its stage of development. You will acquire this new perspective and this new understanding in building a foundation for living The Way of Knowledge.</p>
<p>因为你生活在这个世界上，所以你还不能拥有这种视角，但随着你能够更客观地看待你自己，你会随着时间的推移而获得这种视角。当你现在审视你自己时，你会认为你是好是坏，你的行为或思想是好是坏，这取决于你从周围环境中学到的一套标准。但内识拥有一套不同的标准来决定什么是好是坏。它的标准是没有谴责的。内识公平地对待一切事物，并根据其自然和发展阶段来对待它们。你将获得这种新的视角和新的理解，为内识之路的生命奠定基础。</p>
<p>Though Knowledge brings you into the present with a present state of mind so that you can be fully involved and give even the mundane circumstances of your life your full attention, it also gives you an understanding of what is coming and an ability to look ahead in your life, not to accurately forecast the future but to be able to sense the direction of the world.</p>
<p>尽管内识把你带入当下，带着一种当下的心灵状态，这样你就能充分参与，并对你生命中甚至平凡的境遇给予充分关注，但它也让你理解即将发生的事情，并让你有能力展望你的生命，并非准确地预测未来，而是能够感知世界的方向。</p>
<p>Your life is going somewhere. It has a future and a destiny. The world is going somewhere. It has a future and a destiny. How it will get there is up to the decisions you make today and the decisions that many others make along with you. Yet you do have a destiny, and this cannot be changed. How well you will fare in this destiny is dependent upon your development and the development of others. The world will emerge into the Greater Community. Humanity will eventually become one united society. Whether this emergence gives you your greatest opportunity for advancement or whether it enslaves your race is partially up to you. Whether humanity’s united society is a society of Wisdom, compassion and understanding that can tolerate diversity or whether it is an oppressive society with a cruel and harsh dictatorship that values control beyond all things, the outcome is up to you and up to others along with you.</p>
<p>你的生命正在走向某个地方。它有一个未来和一个天命。世界正在走向某个地方。它有一个未来和一个天命。它将如何到达大社区取决于你今天做出的决定以及和你一起做出的许多其他人的决定。然而你确实有一个天命，这是无法改变的。你将如何顺利地完成这个天命，取决于你的发展和他人的发展。世界将步入大社区。人类最终将成为一个团结的社会。这种出现是给了你们最大的发展机会，还是奴役了你们的种族，这在一定程度上取决于你。人类的团结社会究竟是一个充满智慧、同情和理解、能够容忍多样性的社会，还是一个残酷苛刻、将控制看得比一切都重要的独裁专制的压迫性社会，其结果取决于你，也取决于与你一起的其他人。</p>
<p>Do not think, however, that because you have a destiny, everything is always predetermined, for this is not the case. You are moving towards your destiny, but how you move, where you go and how you prepare will determine the nature of the outcome. For example, you will grow older and you will enter the next stage of your life, whether that be adulthood, middle age or old age. But what that stage of life will be like for you will be determined largely by how well you prepare today, by what action you take in your life now and by your understanding and comprehension of your own life’s development.</p>
<p>然而，不要认为你有一个天命，一切就都是注定的，事实并非如此。你正在朝着你的天命前进，但你如何前进、去往何处以及如何准备将决定结果的性质。例如，你会长大，进入生命的下一个阶段，无论是成年、中年还是老年。但对你来说，这个人生阶段会是什么样子，很大程度上取决于你今天的准备程度、你现在在生命中采取的行动以及你对你自身生命发展的理解和领悟。</p>
<p>When people live in their minds, they are governed by their thinking, which may have nothing to do with the real process of life. They are governed by their hopes and their fears, which naturally go together. They are rarely prepared for the future, and often those who do prepare for the future do so at the expense of the present, for they are concerned and anxious about what will happen to them down the road. Yet how can you live a balanced life in keeping with the reality of life when you are so circumscribed by your own ideas and conditioning?</p>
<p>当人们活在他们的心灵中时，人们被他们的思维所支配，而这些思维可能与生命的真实过程毫无关系。他们被希望和恐惧所支配，而希望和恐惧自然而然地结合在一起。他们很少为未来做好准备，而那些为未来做准备的人往往以牺牲现在为代价，因为他们担心和焦虑未来会发生什么。然而，当你被你自身的想法和条件所束缚时，你又如何能过上与生命现实相符的平衡生命呢？</p>
<p>The Creator has a perfect answer to this seemingly insurmountable problem. The answer has been placed within you and is carried within you like a secret cargo, waiting to emerge, waiting until a sufficient maturity has been developed in your life where you will be able to accept and to respond to the great endowment that the Creator has given you. You build a foundation for this in your relationships, in your ability to work in the world and in your appreciation that you have a spiritual reality and that there are greater powers in the world beyond your ideas.</p>
<p>造物主对于这个看似无法克服的问题有一个完美的答案。答案已经被放置在你的内心深处，就像一个秘密货物一样被携带在你的内心深处，正等待着浮现，正等待着在你的生命中发展出足够的成熟，在成熟中你将能够接受和回应造物主赋予你的伟大禀赋。你在你的关系中、在你在这个世界上工作的能力中、在你对你拥有一个精神现实的欣赏中，以及在你对这个世界上存在着超越你的想法的更伟大力量的欣赏中，为它建立了一个基础。</p>
<p>When people are dominated by their thoughts, beliefs and attitudes, when these represent the prison bars that prevent their free access to life, they often want to do away with it all. They do not want to think of the future, and they do not want to think of the past. They say, “Well, the past is over and the future doesn’t exist. There is only now.” The past is over, but it is your foundation for today. The future is coming, and you need to prepare for it. Your foundation in life, whether it is a foundation for Knowledge or a foundation for your own ideas, will set the stage for your future existence and will determine whether you will be able to fulfill your greater destiny in the world.</p>
<p>当人们被他们的思想、信念和态度所支配时，当这些思想、信念和态度成为阻碍他们自由进入生命的牢笼时，他们往往想要抛弃这一切。他们不想思考未来，他们也不愿思考过去。他们说：“好吧，过去已经过去，未来也不存在。只有现在。”过去已经过去，但它是你今天的基础。未来即将到来，你需要为此做好准备。你在生命中的基础，无论是内识的基础还是你自身想法的基础，都将为你未来的存在奠定基础，并将决定你是否能够实现你在这个世界上的更伟大天命。</p>
<p>In this, the world teaches one thing and Knowledge teaches another. The crowd goes one way, but those who are responding to Knowledge go another way. And they look at where everyone else is going, and they wonder, “Am I making the right decision? Even my friends are going a different way than I am now. Why am I doing this? Is this the right thing? Am I fooling myself once again?” But underneath this questioning and concern, there is a quiet urging to go on, to enter that wilderness beyond ideas and self-definition, to enter pure experience, to come close to Knowledge and to learn to rely on Knowledge, to be without definition and at last to be in contact with the real movement and current of your life and life around you.</p>
<p>在这一点上，世界教导一种生命，而内识教导另一种生命。众人走的是一条路，而那些对内识做出回应的人走的却是另一条路。他们看着其他人的方向，他们心想：“我做的决定是对的吗？就连我的朋友也在走与我不同的路。我为什么要这么做？这样做对吗？我是不是又在自欺欺人？”但是，在这种质疑和担忧之下，有一种悄无声息的敦促，敦促你继续前行，进入超越想法和自我定义的荒野，进入纯粹的体验，接近内识并学习依赖内识，不被定义，最终接触到你的生命和周围生命的真正运动和潮流。</p>
<p>The Unseen Ones who oversee your development, who are the Angels of the Creator, are planning for the future too because they see what is coming. And they know that if you do not prepare adequately, the situation will not be to your liking or to your advantage. They are aware of people’s complacency and the foolish things that people tell themselves. They know the struggle and the tribulation. They know the intense desire and courage it takes to awaken, even from a happy dream.</p>
<p>那些监督你们发展的不可见者，即造物主的天使，也在为未来做计划，因为他们看到了即将发生的事情。他们知道，如果你没有充分准备，情况将不会如你所愿或对你有利。他们知道人们的自满和人们对他们自己说的蠢话。他们知道挣扎和磨难。他们知道，即使是从美梦中醒来，也需要强烈的渴望和勇气。</p>
<p>The Unseen Ones know the situation is urgent, and they are concerned for you. They are not only concerned with what calamities might prevail if people do not prepare. They are also concerned that you may miss your opportunity to give your greater gifts here in the world. In a sense, this is a greater tragedy. It means that so much effort and work on your behalf will have come to naught. It means that so much cooperation, planning and preparation will never be fulfilled in this life. It means you will have to go back Home, become reoriented to your Spiritual Family and then go through the whole process all over again—birth, infancy, childhood, young adulthood, and then the struggle to come to terms with the deeper nature of your life and the reality of its mission here.</p>
<p>不可见者知道情况的紧急，他们关心你。他们不仅关心如果人们不做好准备，可能出现什么样的灾难。他们还担心你可能错过在这个世界上给予你更伟大礼物的机会。从某种意义上说，这是一个更大的悲剧。这意味着你为之付出的如此多的努力和工作将化为乌有。它意味着，如此多的合作、规划和准备将永远无法在这个生命中实现。它意味着你将必须回到古老家园，重新定位到你的精神家庭，然后重新经历整个过程——出生、婴儿期、童年、青年期，然后努力接受你生命更深层次的自然以及它在此的使命的现实。</p>
<p>You have already come so far. You have built in the past in order to be able to study a Greater Community Way of Knowledge, to consider the reality of your Spiritual Family, and to engage your time—your days and your hours—to building the Four Pillars of your life, not only for survival but to become a platform for a Greater Reality to speak through you and with you, according to your destined activity in the world.</p>
<p>你已经走了这么远。你在过去构建了一些东西，以便能够学习大社区内识之路，思考你精神家庭的现实，并投入你的时间——你的每一天，你的每一小时——都是为了建立你生命的四大支柱，这不仅是为了生存，更是为了成为一个平台，让更伟大的现实根据你在这个世界上注定要进行的活动，通过你并与你一起讲话。</p>
<p>Without this, what is life but a struggle for survival, a struggle that will end in your trying to acquire as much pleasure, as many possessions and as much security as possible, only to have to give everything over incrementally or all at once? How great the work, how little the reward. If you were not spiritually endowed, if you had not brought gifts with you from your Ancient Home into the world, then there would be no great problem here. You could simply come and live out your years, do the best you could, make mistakes and then leave. But what is the meaning of this? Why would you go to so much effort to come into such a difficult world? Why would you undertake such a long and seemingly unnatural journey to enter into the body, to learn the ways of the world and to have to care for your physical life at such great expense?</p>
<p>如果没有这些，生命除了是为了生存而奋斗，最终会以你试图获得尽可能多的快乐、尽可能多的财产和尽可能多的安全感而告终，最后却不得不一点一点地或一下子放弃这一切？这是多么艰辛的工作，而回报却是多么微不足道。如果你没有精神天赋，如果你没有从你的古老家园带着礼物来到这个世界，那么这里就不会有什么大问题。你可以简单地来到这里，度过你的岁月，尽你所能，犯错，然后离开。但这是什么意思？你为什么要付出如此多的努力来到如此艰难的世界？你为什么要经历如此漫长而看似不自然的旅程，进入身体，学习世界之路，并不得不以如此巨大的代价来照顾你的物质生命？</p>
<p>This is the real question. If you could but for a moment experience your reality with your Spiritual Family, you would see that their love and inclusion in life and their bond of dedication are completely intact. Why would you leave that and come into a world like this to be a part of a struggling race, troubled and aggravated by the vicissitudes of life and driven by the passions of individual fulfillment? Why would you undergo such a difficult birth? No matter how good your life may be, it is only good for moments, and it cannot compare in any way with your greater life beyond the world.</p>
<p>这才是真正的问题。如果你能与你的精神家庭一起体验你的现实，哪怕只有片刻，你也会发现他们对生命的爱和包容，以及他们奉献的纽带是完好无损的。你为什么要离开这一切，来到这样一个世界，成为一个挣扎的种族的一部分，被生命的沧桑所困扰和折磨，被个人成就的激情所驱使？你为什么要经历如此艰难的诞生？无论你的生命有多美好，那也只是暂时的美好，它无法与你在世界之外更伟大的生命相提并论。</p>
<p>Knowledge will remind you of this, for the closer you come to Knowledge, the more you will sense that you have an origin and a destiny beyond the world. The more you can experience this and can reflect upon it, the greater will be the sense that you have a mission in life. This mission will press upon you. It will keep you moving forward. It will not let you settle down in the pretty places that you see along the way. It will not let you give your life to the pretty faces that you meet along the way. It will not let you make compromises about your life or your resources, for it must drive you on to your destiny. And if you cannot respond, then it will grow silent within you, waiting for the moment when you can come to it with open hands and honest questions.</p>
<p>内识将提醒你这一点，因为你越接近内识，你就越能感觉到你有一个超越世界的起源和一个天命。你越能体验这一点并反思这一点，你就越能感觉到你在生命中有一个使命。这个使命将压迫着你。它将让你不断前进。它不会让你安于沿途所见的美好地方。它不会让你把你的生命交给沿途所遇的漂亮面孔。它不会让你对你的生命或你的资源做出妥协，因为它必须驱使你走向你的天命。如果你无法回应，那么它将在你的内在变得沉默，等待着你能够张开双手、带着诚实的问题走向它的那一刻。</p>
<p>Your future is in the Greater Community. That does not mean that you will leave this planet and go somewhere else. It simply means that you will find yourself no longer alone here, and you will be confronted with forces that have greater mental abilities and greater social cohesion. They will be able to think with a group mind. It is only if humanity can develop a group mind based on Knowledge, within small groups of people, that there will be the real possibility of meaningful exchange and the real possibility that you will have the power and the insight to be able to maintain your self-determination amidst the presence of greater forces.</p>
<p>你们的未来在大社区。这并不意味着你们将离开这个星球去往别处。这仅仅意味着你们将发现自己在这里不再孤单，你们将面对拥有更强大心理能力和更强大社会凝聚力的势力。他们将能够以群体的心灵进行思考。只有当人类能够在小群体中发展基于内识的群体心灵时，才有可能进行有意义的交流，你们才有可能拥有力量和洞察力，能够在更强大势力的存在中保持你们的自决权。</p>
<p>This is one of the great requirements that an emerging world faces in the Greater Community. The other great requirement is that humanity must become united, for you cannot be a diffracted and self-opposed people and hope to be able to participate in the Greater Community. Here you will encounter races of great strength and unity. These races do not necessarily possess Knowledge and they may not have Wisdom, but they will have power. Many people wonder, “Well, why don’t they come and talk to our president? Why don’t they come and speak to our leaders?” The reason is that there is no one here who represents the human race. There is no group mind here. A mob is not a group mind. An army is not a group mind. Who can speak for the human race? Who can represent the will of humanity? Even your greatest and most powerful leaders do not have the support of their people and can rarely muster a real consensus amongst the people over any issue. So, who can the visitors from the Greater Community speak to?</p>
<p>这是新兴世界在大社区面临的伟大要求之一。另一个伟大要求是人类必须团结起来，因为你们不能成为一个分裂和自我反对的民族，并希望能够参与大社区。在这里，你们会遇到强大而团结的种族。这些种族不一定拥有内识，他们可能没有智慧，但他们有力量。很多人想知道，“好吧，为什么他们不来和我们的总统谈谈？为什么他们不来和我们的领导人谈谈？”原因是这里没有人能代表人类种族。这里没有群体的心灵。暴徒不是群体的心灵。军队不是群体的心灵。谁能代表人类？谁能代表人类的意志？即使是你们最伟大、最强大的领导人，也没有人民的支持，也很少能在任何问题上在人民中达成真正的共识。那么，来自大社区的来访者可以和谁交谈呢？</p>
<p>Knowledge here must establish a real community—not a community of law, not a community that is governed by manipulation and coercion, but a community that is driven by intention, dedication and a certainty that specific people must bond together to get things done. For even if there were no Greater Community, only a group mind could achieve any great result in the world. Remember, an individual is only a potential for relationship, and a relationship is a potential for establishing something of meaning and value here. That is why the idea that you can do it alone or you can find your way on your own is hopeless and meaningless. It represents the great fallacy of separation and one of the great tribulations and challenges facing humanity at this time. For humanity is not united enough to be able to participate effectively in the Greater Community. Humanity cannot find the basis for consensus in order to arouse an effective response to the Greater Community. Humanity is governed by superstition and by a limited perspective. Because it is not yet mature as a race, despite its great insights and spiritual affinity, humanity is very vulnerable in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>内识在这里必须建立起一个真正的社区——不是一个法制社区，不是一个受操纵和胁迫统治的社区，而是一个由意图、奉献和特定人群必须团结起来才能完成任务的确定性所驱动的社区。因为即使没有大社区，也只有群体心灵才能在世界上取得任何伟大的成就。记住，个体只是一种关系的潜力，而关系是在此建立某种有意义和价值的事物的潜力。正因为如此，认为你可以独自完成或可以独自找到你的道路的想法是无望和毫无意义的。它代表了分离的巨大谬误，也是人类当前面临的巨大磨难和挑战之一。因为人类还不够团结，无法有效地参与大社区。人类无法找到共识的基础，以激发对大社区的有效回应。人类受迷信和有限视野的支配。因为作为一个种族，人类尚未成熟，尽管它有着伟大的洞察力和精神的亲和力，但人类在大社区中非常脆弱。</p>
<p>This is your future. If you cannot become united within yourself, and if you cannot even unite with another or with a handful of people, your life will not be fulfilled. You will not be able to build a foundation for the second great stage of your life.</p>
<p>这就是你们的未来。如果你不能团结起来，如果你甚至不能和另一个人或少数人团结起来，你的生命就不会圆满。你将无法为生命的第二个伟大阶段奠定基础。</p>
<p>The world is emerging into the Greater Community and you must prepare—mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually. Your future will be unlike the past. You sense this. You feel it. And it gives rise to anxiety, restlessness and concern. Do not attribute your restlessness only to your psychology or to your society or to your past, for you are feeling the movement of the world, and you are ill at ease with it. You are ill at ease because the situation is becoming grave, and you know something must be done. You may hope and pray that there will be some inspired individual other than yourself who will take action. Yet at some point, you will find that the responsibility is yours and not someone else’s, and that the future is calling you. It is calling for you to prepare now. Even your own life is calling for you to prepare, for your individual life and life in the world are not separate.</p>
<p>世界正在步入大社区，你必须做好准备——在心理上、在情感上、在身体上和精神上。你们的未来将不同于过去。你们感觉到了这一点。你们感受到了这一点。它引发了焦虑、不安和担忧。不要将你的不安仅仅归咎于你的心理、你的社会或你的过去，因为你正在感受到世界的变动，你对此感到不安。你感到不安是因为情况正在变得严峻，你知道必须做点什么。你可能希望并祈祷除了你自己之外，还会有某个受启发的人采取行动。然而在某个时刻，你会发现责任是你的，而不是别人的，未来在召唤你。它在召唤你现在就做好准备。甚至你自身的生命也在召唤你做好准备，因为你个人的生命和世界上的生命并不是分离的。</p>
<p>Who you are and what you are here to do are directly related to what the world is and what the world needs. People do not understand this because they think that they are creating their own reality, and so their idea of Higher Purpose is what they would ultimately like to do, the thing that would be the most fun and enjoyable. But your Higher Purpose will never be found in this because you must re-establish relationship with life to find your purpose here. There is no purpose in the world of imagination. Though you may devote all of your life and all of your resources to trying to be, do and have what looks most appealing, you are in fact designed for something else. When you come to that threshold where you want to give yourself to others and give yourself to life, when you realize that you cannot fulfill yourself alone and that there is no fulfillment in a self-determined life, then you will hear your Spiritual Family, and the Unseen Ones will come close to you, for you are waking from a long and troubled dream. Then the power of the universe will respond to you, for you are responding to it.</p>
<p>你是谁、你来此做什么，与世界是什么、世界需要什么直接相关。人们不理解这一点，因为他们认为他们正在创造他们自身的现实，所以他们心中的更高宗旨是他们最终想要做的事情，最有趣、最令人享受的事情。但你的更高宗旨永远不会在这里找到，因为你必须重新建立与生命的关系，才能在这里找到你的目的。想象的世界里没有目的。尽管你可能会把你的一生和所有的资源都奉献给试图成为、做和拥有看起来最有吸引力的事情，但事实上你是为别的事情而设计的。当你到达你想要把你自己给予他人、给予生命的门槛时，当你意识到你无法独自满足你自己，自我决定的生命也无法实现你自己时，你就会听到你精神家庭的声音，不可见者会靠近你，因为你正从一个漫长而不安的梦中醒来。那时宇宙的力量会回应你，因为你正在回应它。</p>
<p>The world is calling you, for you are needed here. You have brought with you the Knowledge necessary to carry out what must be done. This is the foundation for real union with others. You have brought in your parachute kit what you will need, but you will not be able to carry it out alone. You will need Knowledge. You will need others and their Knowledge. You will need your abilities. You will need others and their abilities. This will not happen all at once because you must build a foundation within yourself. You must become prepared. You do not take a person who is a beginner and give them a great mission to do, for they will fail. You must prepare them first.</p>
<p>世界正在召唤你，因为这里需要你。你已经带来了完成必须完成的任务所必需的内识。这是与他人真正团结的基础。你已经带来了你所需要的降落伞包，但你无法独自完成它。你需要内识。你需要他人以及他们的内识。你将需要你的能力。你将需要其他人以及他们的能力。这不会一下子发生，因为你必须在你自己内心建立基础。你必须做好准备。你不会带一名初学者去完成一项伟大的任务，因为他们会失败。你必须先让他们做好准备。</p>
<p>What is the preparation for the Greater Community? How does one prepare to live in an emerging world? How does one brace oneself for humanity becoming united? These are all important questions. The answer to these questions is not in words or phrases. The answer is a preparation itself. You must make the journey to reach the goal. You must climb the ladder to get out of the hole. You must take the steps that can take you to that vantage point on the mountain of life where you can see clearly and understand where you are on the path and where the path has taken you, and to gain an appreciation of what is ahead and what it will require.</p>
<p>为大社区做的准备是什么？一个人如何准备生活在一个新兴世界？一个人如何为人类团结起来做好准备？这些都是重要的问题。这些问题的答案不在于文字或短语。答案就是准备本身。你必须踏上旅程，才能到达目标。你必须爬上梯子，才能走出深渊。你必须迈出能够带你到达生命之山的那个观测位置的步骤，在那里你能够清楚地看到并理解你在道路上的位置以及这条道路将带你去往何处，并欣赏前方是什么以及它将需要什么。</p>
<p>This is called working in the world. And your foundation is building the Four Pillars of your life. The preparation will enable you to do this. The preparation for the Greater Community is The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. Only a preparation from beyond the world can prepare you for what is beyond the world. Human religion, human psychology and human spiritual understanding as they exist today are not capable of preparing you for the Greater Community. Though useful and important within the limited context of human life, they do not extend beyond human life to deal with the greater interactions you will have with the Greater Community.</p>
<p>这被称为在世界上的工作。你的基础是构建你生命的四大支柱。准备将使你能够做到这一点。面向大社区的准备是大社区内识之路。只有来自世界之外的准备才能让你为世界之外的事情进行准备。当今存在的人类宗教、人类心理学和人类精神理解无法让你为大社区进行准备。尽管它们在人类生命的有限背景下有用且重要，但它们并未超越人类生命来应对你们将与大社区进行的更广泛互动。</p>
<p>These interactions are not something that will happen in the distant future, for they are happening now and will happen increasingly in the times to come. Greater Community forces are in the world today, in small numbers, determining how to preserve the environment for their use and determining how humanity can become part of their alliance. These forces are not united with each other but represent divergent groups. Here there is competition for humanity’s allegiance. Their numbers are small, but their power is great. Yet their technology is not the power that will give them dominance here. It is their group mind and their ability to affect the mental environment.</p>
<p>这些互动并不是遥远未来才会发生的事情，因为它们现在正在发生，并将在未来的时代越来越多地发生。大社区的势力在当今世界上的数量并不多，它们决定着如何保护环境以供它们使用，决定着人类如何成为它们联盟的一部分。这些势力彼此并不团结，而是代表着不同的群体。这里存在着对人类效忠的竞争。它们的数量并不多，但他们的力量是强大的。然而，它们的技术并不是让它们在这里占据主导地位的力量。而是它们的群体心灵和影响心理环境的能力。</p>
<p>These groups are not strong with Knowledge, or they would not be attempting to manipulate humanity. Knowledge would never lead a person or a group to do that. Yet even without Knowledge, the power of collective thinking can create dominant forces in the mental environment. Here the Greater Community forces will use human religion and affect human governments to achieve their goals. They will take full advantage of humanity’s superstitions. They will take full advantage of the liabilities of human ignorance. They are not here to teach a Greater Community Way of Knowledge, for they do not want people to have Knowledge. They want to keep people in a state of ignorance and suspended animation. They do not want to destroy humanity because they value humanity as part of the resources of this world. But they will not support humanity becoming a self-determining race. Only if humanity itself can become strong and unified will its self-determination be assured.</p>
<p>这些群体的内识并不强大，否则他们就不会试图操纵人类。内识永远不会引导一个人或一个群体这么做。然而，即使没有内识，群体心灵的力量也能在心理环境中创造主导力。在这里，大社区的势力将利用人类宗教并影响人类政府，以实现它们的目标。他们将充分利用人类的迷信。他们将充分利用人类无知的劣势。他们来这里不是为了教授大社区内识之路，因为他们不希望人们拥有内识。他们想让人们处于无知和假死状态。他们不想毁灭人类，因为他们珍视人类是这个世界资源的一部分。但他们不会支持人类成为一个自决的种族。只有人类它自己能够变得强大和统一，它的自决才能得到保证。</p>
<p>The Greater Community forces do not need weapons. They do not need armaments, for they have power in the mental environment. Why fight someone when you can simply influence their behavior? Why destroy someone’s city when you can simply make them preserve it for you? The visitors value your environment. They are interested in your creations. They do not want to destroy them. And they do not want you to destroy them either. But their motives are not for your well-being. These are divergent forces, and they are in competition with each other to a certain extent, for they represent different allegiances in the Greater Community. It would be like different European nations finding the same rich tropical island hundreds of years ago. They would compete for it because they want it for themselves. And they would want to use the native people, but they are not there for the native people’s benefit. This is a good analogy, for your history teaches you this. It teaches you of the calamity that happens when greater forces overcome weaker forces. Yet your history only accounts for the interaction between people. It does not account for the interaction between humans and other forms of intelligent life. And your current inability to coexist with each other harmoniously demonstrates that you do not yet have the capacity to deal with Greater Community forces effectively. Because you are weak and diffracted and because your cultures are not united, the visitors will attempt to establish their dominion here. From their point of view, there is no other way.</p>
<p>大社区势力不需要武器。他们不需要军备，因为他们在心理环境中拥有力量。既然你可以简单地影响他们的行为，为什么要与他人战斗？既然你可以简单地让他们为你保护城市，为什么要摧毁他们的城市？来访者重视你们的环境。他们对你们的创造物感兴趣。他们不想摧毁它们。他们也不希望你们摧毁它们。但他们的动机不是为了你们的福祉。这些是不同的势力，它们在一定程度上相互竞争，因为它们代表着大社区中的不同盟友。这就像几百年前不同的欧洲国家发现了同一个富饶的热带岛屿。他们会争夺它，因为他们想要它。他们会想利用当地人，但他们在那里并不是为了当地人的利益。这是一个很好的比喻，因为你们的历史教会了你们这一点。它告诉你们，当更强大的势力战胜更弱的势力时，会发生灾难。然而，你们的历史只解释了人与人之间的互动。它没有考虑到人类与其他形式的智能生命之间的互动。而你们目前还无法和谐共存，表明你们还没有能力有效地应对大社区势力。由于你们软弱、分散，而且你们的文化不是统一的，来访者将试图在这里建立他们的统治。从他们的角度来看，没有其他方法。</p>
<p>You may ask, “Are they evil?” They are not evil. They are simply looking out for their own interests and following their own values. Good and evil do not apply here. Those who want to use you believe that you cannot control yourselves, so you must be controlled. And if you could control yourselves, they would consider intervention here more carefully, for your numbers are great and you have the ability to resist them within your own native environment.</p>
<p>你可能会问：“他们是邪恶的吗？”他们并不邪恶。他们只是在追求他们自身的利益，遵循他们自身的价值观。善恶在这里并不适用。那些想利用你们的群体相信你们无法控制你们自己，所以你们必须被控制。如果你们能够控制你们自己，他们会更谨慎地考虑在这里进行干预，因为你们的数量很大，你们有能力在你们自身的本土环境中抵抗他们。</p>
<p>You might say, “Well, our governments will come together and unite all of their military strength,” but your governments are already vulnerable to Greater Community influence and will not fight those forces that influence them.</p>
<p>你可能会说：“好吧，我们的政府将走到一起，统一他们所有的军事力量”，但是你们的政府已经很容易受到大社区的影响，并且不会对抗那些影响他们的势力。</p>
<p>In the Greater Community, power is exercised in the physical and in the mental environments. Human beings know something about power in the physical environment because they have been exercising it for centuries, often to their own detriment. But power in the mental environment is something new. It is a new frontier for human education and understanding.</p>
<p>在大社区中，力量在物理环境和心理环境中发挥作用。人类对物理环境中的力量有所知道，因为他们已经运用这种力量几个世纪了，而且常常损害他们自身的利益。但心理环境中的力量是一种新的事物。它是人类教育和理解的新领域。</p>
<p>The Greater Community Way of Knowledge prepares you to enter into the mental environment with your real abilities intact—not for you to become a master, but for you to become proficient and effective in order for you to learn to hold your own ground. Here you might say, “Well, this all sounds too much for me,” but this is your world. This is the destiny of your world. This is the future. People are unprepared for the future. They are still thinking for themselves alone. They are still wondering how they can offset their past problems. They are devoting all of their time and resources to their personal interests, their personal pursuits and their personal difficulties. There is a great disability in the human family now. And there is great risk because the human family has grown very large and is using up the resources of the world at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>大社区的内识之路让你进行准备，让你带着完整的真正能力进入心理环境——不是为了让你成为一个大师，而是为了让你变得熟练和有效，以便让你学会坚守你自身的立场。在此你或许会说：“好吧，这听起来对我来说太多了”，但这是你们的世界。这是你们世界的天命。这是未来。人们没有为未来做好准备。人们依然只为他们自己思考。他们依然在思考如何能够抵消他们过去的问题。他们把所有的时间和资源都交给了他们的个人兴趣、他们的个人追求和他们的个人困难。现在人类大家庭中存在着巨大的残疾。存在着巨大的风险，因为人类大家庭已经变得非常庞大，并且正在迅速消耗着世界的资源。</p>
<p>It is important to remember that you are not here for yourself alone. You are here for your whole race. You are here for life. Our words seem difficult because people still think that they are here for themselves alone and are primarily concerned with the preservation of their own interests and goals. All we are doing is reacquainting you with the purpose for which you have come and with the world which you have come to serve. If this is a challenge to you, then you must evaluate your current position. If this seems threatening, then you must ask yourself, “Why would a gift of this magnitude be threatening and am I protecting what is really valuable?” Without the truth, people guard their substitutes for truth, and they guard them vehemently. But the truth is awaiting you. The truth will bring you back into the world. The truth will honor your great abilities. The truth will honor your great relationships, and the truth will honor those who sent you and those who are waiting to receive you.</p>
<p>重要的是要记住，你来到这里不只是为了你自己。你来到这里是为了你的整个种族。你来到这里是为了生命。我们的话似乎很难，因为人们仍然认为他们来到这里只是为了他们自己，他们主要关心的是维护他们自己的利益和目标。我们所做的只是让你重新认识你来到这里的目的，以及你来这里服务的世界。如果这对你来说是一个挑战，那么你必须评估你目前的位置。如果这看起来有威胁性，那么你必须问你自己，“为什么这么大的礼物会有威胁性，我在保护真正有价值的东西吗？”没有真理，人们会守护他们真理的替代品，他们坚决地守护它们。但真理正在等着你。真理会把你带回这个世界。真理会尊重你的伟大能力。真理会尊重你的伟大关系，真理会尊重那些派遣你的人和那些等待接受你的人。</p>
<p>There must be an opportunity to establish group mind in Knowledge here. This cannot be done at the level of nations because humanity has not advanced that far. This cannot even be done at the level of large groups because your race has not advanced that far. Remember, in a state of adolescence, everyone is out for themselves, even if they have newfound powers and abilities. Even if they are acting like adults, they are still thinking like children. A mature race is a race that has found its common needs and common boundaries and has found a basis for uniting itself.</p>
<p>在这里，必须有机会在内识中建立群体心灵。这无法在国家的层面上实现，因为人类还没有发展到那个程度。这甚至无法在大众的层面上实现，因为你们的种族还没有发展的如此之远。记住，在青春期，每个人都是为了他们自己，即使他们拥有新发现的力量和能力。即使他们表现得像成年人，他们仍然像孩子一样思考。一个成熟的种族是一个已经找到共同需求和共同界限，并且找到了团结基础的种族。</p>
<p>Humanity is not yet a mature race. You seem magnificent compared to the plants and animals, but they are more orderly than you are. No matter how great you may seem within your own domain, you are very small and weak in the Greater Community. Here the Greater Community offers you real opportunity for advancement and the impetus for change. It provides the groundwork for people to find their unity, for everyone in the world faces the dilemma of Greater Community intervention. The Greater Community can teach you a great deal. It can show you a great deal. And it can force you to respond. Its risks and its opportunities are greater than anything the human race has ever faced before. To respond, enough of you must develop a group mind in Knowledge—not just one person. It is no longer sufficient to simply have one inspired individual here and there.</p>
<p>人类还不是一个成熟的种族。与植物和动物相比，你们似乎很伟大，但它们比你们更有秩序。无论你们在你们自身的领域中看起来多么伟大，你们在大社区中都是非常渺小和弱小的。在这里，大社区为你们提供了真正的进步机会和改变的动力。它为人们找到团结提供了基础，因为世界上每个人都面临着大社区干预的困境。大社区可以教给你们许多事情。它可以向你们展示许多事情。它可以迫使你们做出回应。它的风险和机遇比人类过去面临的任何事情都要大。为了做出回应，你们中足够多的人必须在内识中发展出一种群体心灵——而不仅仅是一个人。仅仅在这里或那里有一个受启发的个体已经不够了。</p>
<p>Humanity, because of its tribal background, is able to coalesce into small groups and to establish very strong environments for a group mind. In the group mind, you do not give up your individuality. You simply pool your intellect so that your group has greater and greater resources. Here you serve to verify and to support Knowledge within each other. Here you recognize that Knowledge is greater than you individually and greater than your group. Here you aim to use your greater abilities to build the Four Pillars of your life and to meet the challenges of your greater endeavor together.</p>
<p>人类由于其部落背景，能够凝聚成小的群体，并建立起非常强大的群体心灵的环境。在群体心灵中，你不会放弃你的个体性。你们只是集中了你们的智力，使你们的群体拥有越来越多的资源。在这里，你们相互验证和支持内识。在这里，你认识到内识比你个人更伟大，也比你的群体更伟大。在这里，你旨在使用你更伟大的能力来构建你生命的四大支柱，并共同应对你更伟大事业的挑战。</p>
<p>A group mind can only be established by a community that has a focus and a shared activity. It is not a weekend affair between people who are otherwise disassociated from each other. It is not a support group that gets together once in awhile and tries to find some common ground. Instead, it represents a community of people who are fully bonded with each other. They are all still made up of individuals, but each person now is valued in terms of the talents that he or she can contribute. For what value is there in individuality except in the fact that you have individual gifts to give? Beyond this, individuality becomes your personal prison cell, a place where you can live but cannot escape.</p>
<p>只有具有共同目标和共同活动的社区才能建立群体心灵。它不是彼此疏远的人们周末聚会的场合。它也不是偶尔聚在一起试图找到共同点的支持群体。相反，它代表的是一个由彼此完全联系在一起的人组成的社区。他们仍然都是由个人组成的，但现在每个人的价值都取决于他或她可以贡献的才能。因为除了你有个人礼物可以给予之外，个体性还有什么价值呢？除此之外，个体性就成了你的个人牢笼，一个你可以生活却无法逃离的地方。</p>
<p>In the Greater Community you will find individuality is not valued very highly because compared to the power of group mind, individuality is weak and can always be overcome. That is why the great saints in your past have had their Spiritual Family at hand. They were not thinking like individuals. They were not acting like individuals. They were representing a group mind. Any person who demonstrates real spiritual power in the world, any person who demonstrates physical power in the world and any person who demonstrates mental power in the mental environment all represent group mind because a coalescing of intelligence and the focus of many minds will always be stronger than one mind. One mind alone will not be able to verify its own experience effectively. Here you reach the limits of your individuality. Here you also see where your individuality has real purpose and merit. Here you see that your individuality is meant to be a contribution to others rather than a glorification of your own struggle to be free from others.</p>
<p>在大社区中，你会发现个体性不受重视，因为与群体心灵的力量相比，个体性是脆弱的，而且总是可以被克服的。这就是为什么你们过去的伟大圣人都有他们的精神家庭。他们不是以个体的方式进行思考。他们不是以个体的方式进行行动。他们代表着一个群体心灵。任何在世界上展示真正精神力量的人，任何在世界上展示物理力量的人，任何在心理环境中展示心理力量的人，都代表着群体心灵，因为智能的凝聚和众多心灵的聚焦总是比一个人的心灵更强大。一个人的心灵无法有效地验证它自身的经验。在这里，你达到了你个体性的极限。在这里，你也看到了你的个体性在哪里具有真正的目的和价值。在这里，你看到你的个体性意味着对他人做出贡献，而不是赞美你自身为摆脱他人而进行的斗争。</p>
<p>Humanity is adolescent because it is self-obsessed and because people are still living for themselves primarily. The extent to which people respond to each other and are devoted to each other represents the strength of the human race at this point in time. Every act of kindness, every act of selflessness, every genuine gift that is given in the world between people in all situations collectively represents the strength of the human race at this time.</p>
<p>人类处于青春期，因为人类痴迷于自我，因为人们仍然主要为他们自己而活。人们相互回应和相互忠诚的程度代表了人类在现今这个时刻的力量。世界上所有情况下人们之间所给予的每一个善举、每一个无私的行为、每一个真诚的礼物，都代表了人类在现今这个时刻的力量。</p>
<p>If humanity cannot rule itself effectively, it will eventually fall under Greater Community domination. This is just like your life in the world now. If you cannot manage your affairs, others will come to manage them for you. If you cannot direct your own thinking, others will attempt to direct it for you. If you cannot pay your own bills, well, then others will have to pay them for you. This is simply a fact of life. This is what happens in intelligent life everywhere in the universe. Your world is no exception. This happens within the realm of your own world, and it happens in the Greater Community. It is a fact of life.</p>
<p>如果人类不能有效地自我统治，它最终将落入大社区的统治之下。这就像你们现在在世界上的生命。如果你不能管理好你的事务，其他人就会来替你管理。如果你不能指导你自身的思维，其他人就会试图来替你指导它。如果你不能支付你自身的账单，那么，其他人就会替你付账。这只是生命中的一个简单事实。这发生在宇宙所有的智能生命之中。你们的世界也不例外。这发生在你们自己世界的领域里，也发生在大社区中。它是生命的一个事实。</p>
<p>Knowledge seeks to make you strong so that you can make your own decisions, decisions which are wise and effective. But Knowledge recognizes that your decisions alone will not bring about a great result in the world in service to anyone or anything. You must join with others to do this. You must join your intelligence. You must contribute your real gifts and your particular talents and pool them with others. This creates a group mind. This is power. This enables things to get achieved at every level of human experience. This would be true even if there were no Greater Community. But it is required now because there is a Greater Community.</p>
<p>内识寻求让你变得强大，这样你就能做出你自身的决定，明智而有效的决定。但是内识认识到，单凭你的决定，无法为世界上的任何人或任何事情带来伟大的成果。你必须和其他人一起做到这一点。你必须汇聚你的智能。你必须贡献你真正的礼物和你独特的才能，并将它们与他人汇集在一起​​。这创造了一种群体心灵。这就是力量。这让事情能够在人类经验的每个层面上得到实现。即使没有大社区，这也是事实。但现在这是必需的，因为有一个大社区。</p>
<p>From a greater point of view, your emergence into the Greater Community represents redemption, not because your visitors from the Greater Community are here to save you but because they will require you, through circumstance and by the mere existence of their presence in the world, to finally wake up, to organize yourselves and to develop maturity. This maturing process will not be easy, just like it is not easy to become an adult from a state of adolescence. Adolescents become adults when they realize that they have restrictions, limitations, and responsibilities; when they realize that no one is going to do it all for them and that life has demands and consequences. This is what matures the adolescent person. This is what matures an adolescent race.</p>
<p>从更伟大的视角来看，你们进入大社区代表着救赎，这并不是因为大社区的来访者来此拯救你们，而是因为他们需要你们，通过环境，通过他们在世界上的存在，最终觉醒，组织起来，走向成熟。这个成熟的过程并不容易，就像从青少年状态成为成年人并不容易一样。当青少年意识到他们有限制、局限和责任时，当他们意识到没有人会为他们做所有事情，生命有要求和后果时，他们就变成了成年人。这就是青春期个体的成熟。这就是青春期种族的成熟。</p>
<p>Therefore, the Greater Community is your redemption, for it will give you the foundation and a great common cause upon which to organize your people and to learn to cooperate together, for you will all share the same challenges now. Greater Community intervention and the breakdown of the world’s environment—these two great things will affect human unity and force it to come about in one form or another.</p>
<p>因此，大社区是你们的救赎，因为它将为你们提供基础和一个伟大的共同事业，在此基础上组织你们的民众并学习共同合作，因为你们现在都面临同样的挑战。大社区的干预和世界环境的崩溃——这两件大事将影响人类团结，并迫使它以某种形式实现。</p>
<p>If humanity were alone in the universe, if it never encountered other intelligent life, then it would seem that you could go on and on living recklessly and competing with each other. But even this would have an endpoint, for you would soon use up your world’s resources. This would force people to come together because you could not afford to destroy each other since the resources used for this would be too valuable. You would have to reach an agreement. Like people in a lifeboat after the ship had sunk, you would have to establish a common cause, unity and an effective plan for survival. So, were there no Greater Community forces in the world, if your world still seemed to be an isolated speck floating about in the vastness of space, you would still face the great threshold where the human race must become mature. Survival would motivate you.</p>
<p>如果人类在宇宙中是孤独的，如果它从未遇到过其他智能生命，那么你们似乎可以继续肆无忌惮地生活并相互竞争。但即使这样也会有终点，因为你们很快就会耗尽你们世界的资源。这将迫使人们走到一起，因为你们承受不起相互毁灭的后果，因为用于此的资源太宝贵了。你们必须达成协议。就像船沉没后人们在救生艇上一样，你们必须建立一个共同的事业、团结和有效的生存计划。因此，如果世界上没有大社区的势力，如果你们的世界似乎仍然是浩瀚太空中漂浮的孤立斑点，你们仍然会面临人类必须成熟的伟大门槛。生存将激励你们。</p>
<p>In the Greater Community, you will be faced not only with survival, because your resources will be depleted, but also with the problem of self-determination. Now your adversary is not one another, it is forces from the Greater Community. They will not let you spoil this place because it is too valuable. From their perspective, you are like a quarreling tribe living on valuable real estate. It is now valued by others as well as by you, and you will not realize how valuable it is until there is competition for it.</p>
<p>在大社区中，你们不仅要面对生存，因为你们的资源将被耗尽，还要面对自决的问题。现在你们的对手不是彼此，而是来自大社区的势力。他们不会让你们破坏这个地方，因为它太有价值了。从他们的角度来看，你们就像一个争吵不休的部落，生活在宝贵的房地产上。现在它既受到你们的重视，也受到其他种族的重视，直到有竞争出现，你们才会意识到它有多么宝贵。</p>
<p>We are illustrating the world as it is and as it will be. You know this to be true, even if it runs against your ideas and beliefs, your hopes and your wishes. We give you what you know, not what you want. We give you what you must know in order to fulfill your destiny here and to help preserve your race. For a race to emerge successfully into the Greater Community, it must prepare for the Greater Community. It must learn to apply its spiritual resources to a situation where the Greater Community is part of the environment. Therefore, there is a great calling for learning The Greater Community Way of Knowledge and Greater Community Spirituality. This Teaching is a gift from the Creator to enable humanity to undertake the next great stage in its development where it prepares to emerge into the Greater Community. It is a great answer to a great need. And it is the perfect response to all of the questions of humanity at this time.</p>
<p>我们正在描绘世界的现状和未来。你知道这是事实，即使它违背了你的想法和信念、你的希望和你的愿望。我们给你，你所知道的，而不是你想要的。我们给你，你必须知道的内识，以便实现你在此的天命，帮助保护你的种族。一个种族要想成功地融入大社区，就必须为大社区做好准备。它必须学会将其精神资源应用于大社区成为环境一部分的情况。因此，学习大社区内识之路和大社区精神性有着伟大的召唤。这个教导是来自造物主的礼物，使人类能够进入其发展的下一个伟大阶段，为融入大社区做好准备。这是对一个伟大需求的伟大回答。它是对人类当前所有问题的完美回应。</p>
<p>So, when you ask yourself, “Who am I and why am I here?” also ask the question, “Where is the world going and what must I do for it?” Then you will have all the right questions. If you ask for yourself alone, your questioning will not be complete, and you will not understand the answer. If all of the questions are present, you will understand the answer because you will understand your predicament. And though you will see that you need to build a foundation for learning and living The Way of Knowledge for yourself—for your well-being, for your happiness, for your fulfillment, for the redemption of your own value and meaning here—you will also see that you need it for your whole race and that you are doing this for everyone and not just for yourself. This will enable you to make the sacrifices and the achievements to undertake the preparation that is necessary. Here you are free to go with Knowledge, even if Knowledge leads in a different direction from where you thought you were going before. You are doing this for others. You are doing this for your Spiritual Family. You are doing this for all humanity.</p>
<p>因此，当你问你自己“我是谁，我为什么在这里？”时，也要问“世界将走向何方，我必须为此做些什么？”这样，你就会拥有所有正确的问题。如果你只为你自己问问题，你的提问就不会完整，你也不会理解答案。如果所有问题都存在，你就会理解答案，因为你将理解你的困境。尽管你会看到你需要为你自己构建一个学习和生活在内识之路的基础——为了你的福祉、为了你的幸福、为了你的成就、为了救赎你自身在这里的价值和意义——但你也会看到，你需要为整个种族做准备，你是为了每个人而这样做的，而不仅仅是为了你自己。这将使你能够做出牺牲和成就，以进行必要的准备。在这里，你可以自由地跟随内识，即使内识引领你走向与你之前认为的方向不同的方向。你是为了他人而这样做的。你是为了你的精神家庭而这样做的。你这样做是为了全人类。</p>
<p>For humanity to become a wise and effective participant in the Greater Community, it must become united, it must gain a Greater Community understanding and perspective and it must learn what Greater Community Spirituality means.</p>
<p>为了使人类成为大社区明智和有效的参与者，它必须团结起来，必须获得大社区的理解和视角，必须学习大社区精神性的含义。</p>
<p>Independence in the Greater Community is not a right; it is a privilege. Just as for nations in your world, independence is not a right; it is a privilege. Your own personal independence is not a right; it is a privilege. When you think it is a right, you think that life owes it to you, and you neglect the fact that you will have to work for it, preserve it and use it for a good cause.</p>
<p>在大社区中的独立不是一项权利，而是一项特权。就像你们世界上的国家一样，独立不是一项权利，而是一项特权。你自身个人的独立不是一项权利，而是一项特权。当你认为它是一项权利时，你认为这是生命欠你的，你忽视了你必须为之努力、维护它、为善而使用它的事实。</p>
<p>The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is for you, but it is not only for you. It is for all of humanity. It will not be understood at the outset because it presents the greater problems in life, the problems inherent within people and within the world. It will challenge people’s understanding. It will challenge their tribal beliefs. It will bring to them not only promise but a great deal of work and preparation as well. The Greater Community Way of Knowledge is a ladder for the whole race. This does not mean that everyone will study it, for that is not necessary, but if enough people study it, they will be able to provide Wisdom for the whole world. This Wisdom is needed now. Knowledge must be discovered now. It is needed now. It is needed in your life, and it is needed in the world. You need it and others need for you to reclaim it. Others need it, and you need for them to reclaim it. You need to find your real relationships now, those individuals who were sent into the world from your Spiritual Family to be with you. You must find them. They are looking for you, and as each day passes, the need and the looking become more urgent and more important.</p>
<p>大社区内识之路是为你而设的，但它不仅仅是你而设的。它是为全人类而设的。它一开始不会被理解，因为它呈现了生命中更大的问题，人们内在和世界内在的问题。它将挑战人们的理解。它将挑战他们的部落信仰。它将给他们带来的不仅是承诺，还有大量的工作和准备。大社区内识之路是整个种族的进阶。这并不意味着每个人都会研究它，因为这不是必要的，但是如果有足够多的人研究它，他们将能够为整个世界提供智慧。这种智慧现在是需要的。内识必须现在被发现。它现在是需要的。它在你的生命中是需要的，它在这个世界上是需要的。你需要它，其他人需要你来重新获得它。其他人需要它，你需要他们来重新获得它。你现在需要找到你真正的关系，那些从你的精神家庭被派到这个世界来和你在一起的个体。你必须找到他们。他们正在寻找你，随着每一天的过去，这种需要和寻找变得越来越紧迫，越来越重要。</p>
<p>You do not have all the time to make up your mind and come to terms with your deeper inclinations, for time is precious now and should not be wasted. Much time has been lost already, and it has made your situation as a race more difficult. Much time has been wasted in your life, and it has made your predicament now more difficult.</p>
<p>你没有那么多时间去下定决心，去适应你内心深处的倾向，因为时间现在是宝贵的，不应该被浪费。你们已经浪费了很多时间，这让你们作为一个种族的处境更加困难。你在生命中浪费了许多时间，这让你现在的困境更加困难。</p>
<p>When the house is on fire, everyone must get involved. Some will take greater roles. Some will take lesser roles. Some will simply pass water down the water line. It does not matter who is a hero or who is a heroine, for everyone works together. All that matters is that the fire is put out and the house is saved.</p>
<p>当房子着火时，每个人都必须参与其中。有些人会扮演更重要的角色。有些人会扮演次要的角色。有些人只是沿着水管送水。谁是英雄谁是女英雄并不重要，因为每个人都在一起努力。重要的是火被扑灭，房子被拯救了。</p>
<p>Humanity lives in a very big house. Part of the house is on fire. And others are visiting here to determine how the fire can be put out for their benefit.</p>
<p>人类住在一座很大的房子里。房子的一部分着火了。其他人来这里是为了确定如何扑灭大火，以造福他们。</p>
<p>This is why some people think that Greater Community forces are here to help humanity, because they will help you put the fire out. Yet they will reorganize your race in the process. They will gain control of your leaders in the process. In their own quiet way, they will determine where humanity will go and what it will do. Because they bring an answer, they will be welcomed and they will be trusted. People will believe in them and have hopeful feelings about them because the visitors will seem to be able to handle the situation. They will seem to know what to do while people are all running about in the world, frightened and confused.</p>
<p>正因为如此，有些人认为大社区的势力来此是为了帮助人类，因为他们将帮助你们扑灭大火。然而在此过程中，他们将重组你们的种族。在此过程中，他们将控制你们的领导者。以他们自身安静的方式，他们将决定人类将走向何方、将做什么。因为他们带来了答案，他们将受到欢迎，他们将得到信任。人们将相信他们，对他们抱有希望，因为来访者似乎能够处理这种情况。当人们在世界上四处奔波、惊恐和困惑时，他们似乎知道该做什么。</p>
<p>However, the visitors are not your emancipators. They are your competitors. Yet there are other groups from the Greater Community who serve the emergence of Knowledge in humanity who will not seek to gain control here, for they know that would not be in the best interest of humanity. Your allies will support the emergence of Knowledge because the human race needs Knowledge, and they will support humanity learning Greater Community Knowledge and Wisdom because humanity must learn these in order to participate and compete in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>然而，来访者不是你们的解放者。他们是你们的竞争对手。然而，在大社区中还有其他群体服务于内识在人类中的显现，他们不会寻求在这里获得控制权，因为他们知道这不符合人类的最佳利益。你们的盟友将支持内识的显现，因为人类需要内识，他们将支持人类学习大社区的内识和智慧，因为人类必须学习这些才能参与大社区并在其中竞争。</p>
<p>You have a great deal of preparation to do. Be patient. You are preparing for a very, very great thing. Be patient, but do not be passive. The Way of Knowledge has been introduced into the world just in time. Those who begin the preparation now will be in the best position to contribute to humanity in the times to come. Their learning will be accelerated, their lives will be accelerated, and the changes they need to make within themselves and within their own personal spheres will be accelerated. If they are patient and honest, and if they do not try to use the preparation for their own personal gain, they will be able to build their foundation. And they will be able to find those who have come into the world to help them.</p>
<p>你有大量准备要做。要有耐心。你正在为一件非常非常伟大的事情做准备。要有耐心，但不要消极。内识之路被及时引入世界。那些现在就开始准备的人，将在未来的时间中处于为人类做出贡献的最佳位置。他们的学习将被加速，他们的生命将被加速，他们需要在他们自己和他们自身的个人领域内做出的改变也将被加速。如果他们有耐心和诚实，如果他们不试图利用准备来获取个人利益，他们将能够构建他们的基础。他们将能够找到那些来到这个世界帮助他们的人。</p>
<p>Prepare in this greater education, for the time is great and the hour is late. Everyone is important now. Everyone has something to give, even if it is very small. Everyone can learn The Way of Knowledge at least enough to know to value those virtues that emanate from Knowledge—devotion, compassion, wisdom, strength, perseverance, courage and patience. Some will become proficient in The Way of Knowledge because they will be able to take the steps without claiming a greater role for themselves along the way. They will help prepare humanity for the future and assure that humanity has a future, for humanity must become the wise stewards of the world and prepare to participate in the Greater Community. Both go together and both represent the same goal.</p>
<p>在这个更伟大的教育中做好准备，因为时机已到，时辰已晚。现在每个人都很重要。每个人都有礼物可以给予，即使非常渺小。每个人都可以学习内识之路，至少足以懂得珍惜那些源自内识的美德——奉献、慈悲、智慧、力量、毅力、勇气和耐心。一些人将精通内识之路，因为他们将能够迈出步伐，而不会在途中为他们自己争取更大的角色。他们将帮助人类为未来做好准备，并确保人类拥有未来，因为人类必须成为世界的明智管家，并准备参与大社区。两者相辅相成，都代表着同一个目标。</p>
<p>It is time now to build a foundation for Knowledge. It is time now to build the Four Pillars of life and to learn how to do this in a way where all the pillars are supported and strengthened. It is time to step aside from the grandiose goals and ideals that can only keep you in a state of imagination about your life. It is time to consider your deepest inclinations. It is time to respond to the great needs of the world and to find your role and place there. It is time to give up the idea that you can escape the world or transcend its requirements, for you were not sent here to simply run away.</p>
<p>现在是时候建立内识的基础了。现在是时候建立生命的四大支柱，并学习如何以一种让所有支柱都得到支持和强化的方式做到这一点了。现在是时候摆脱那些只能让你对你的生命保持想象状态的宏伟目标和理想了。现在是时候考虑你内心最深处的倾向了。现在是时候回应世界的伟大需求，并找到你在世界的角色和位置了。现在是时候放弃你可以逃离世界或超越它的要求的想法了，因为你被派到这里不是为了简单地逃避。</p>
<p>Here Heaven and Earth come together because they serve the same purpose. It is in serving the same purpose that their relationship becomes recognized. This is true between Knowledge and your mind. It is true between Knowledge and the world. It is true in the Greater Community as well. At every level of existence—at the level of the individual, at the level of the family, at the level of the culture, at the level of the nation, at the level of the world—these great truths hold true and demonstrate their truth accordingly.</p>
<p>在这里，天堂与大地汇聚在一起，因为它们服务于同一个目的。正是在服务于同一个目的时，它们的关系才得到认识。这在内识和你的心灵之间是真实的。这在内识和世界之间是真实的。这在大社区里也是真实的。在存在的每一个层面——在个体层面、在家庭层面、在文化层面、在国家层面、在世界层面——这些伟大真理都适用并相应地展示它们的真理。</p>
<p>Let us conclude now with a prayer because this is holy work. It is holy because it is complete, because it represents the wholeness of your life. It is holy because it is all encompassing, because it represents the full dimension of your existence here.</p>
<p>现在让我们以祈祷结束这段旅程，因为这是一份神圣的工作。它之所以神圣，是因为它完整，因为它代表了你生命的整体性。它之所以神圣，是因为它包罗万象，因为它代表了你在此存在的全部维度。</p>
