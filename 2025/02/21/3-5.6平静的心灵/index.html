<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on December 3, 2009 in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam<br>2009 年 12 月 3 日，在越南胡志明市（西贡），向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mind is a wonderful vehicle of expression, a tool of communication, allowing you to be in the world to communicate to others who are here. The power of the mind is only known to a few, for most people have not really discovered its importance and its greater facilities, its greater faculties.</p>
<p>心灵是一种奇妙的表达载体，一种沟通工具，它让你能够身处这个世界，与世人交流。心灵的力量只有少数人知道，因为大多数人还没有实际发现心灵的重要性、它的伟大功能和它的伟大能力。</p>
<p>People begin their study of the New Message Teaching very much oppressed by their own minds, very much in the position of being a victim of what they think and feel, with very little control over what they think and feel. It is as if the mind has ruled them, like a harsh master, for all their years.</p>
<p>人们开始学习新讯息教导时，深受他们自身心灵的压迫，成为他们的所思所感的受害者，几乎无法控制他们的所思所感。它就好像心灵是一位严厉的主人一样，统治了他们多年。</p>
<p>As a result, most people are afraid of their minds. That is why people do not want to admit mistakes. They do not want to look at how they have wasted their time and energy because they are afraid of their own personal retribution against themselves. They are afraid of how they would feel about themselves.</p>
<p>因此，大多数人都害怕他们的心灵。这就是为什么人们不愿意承认错误。他们不愿意看到他们是如何浪费时间和能量的，因为他们害怕他们自身的个人报复。他们害怕对他们自己的感觉。</p>
<p>It is a real problem that prevents people from really assessing their own life and experience from a more objective perspective because they are so afraid to face the fact that they have misappropriated so much of their time, energy and resources. It is because they are afraid of their minds. They are afraid of what they would think about themselves and their own self-repudiation, self-criticism and self-denial. It is a serious problem that prevents people from understanding how they got to where they are today—to understanding the journey they have taken thus far objectively, courageously; to see really what their strengths are and where they are vulnerable at this moment.</p>
<p>它是一个真正的问题，它阻碍人们从更客观的角度真正评估他们自身的生命和经历，因为他们害怕面对这样一个事实：他们已经浪费了太多的时间、能量和资源。它是因为他们害怕他们的心灵。他们害怕他们会如何看待他们自己以及他们自身的自我否认、自我批评和自我否定。它是一个严重的问题，它阻碍人们理解他们是如何走到今天这一步的——无法客观、勇敢地理解他们迄今为止走过的旅程；无法真正看到他们的优势是什么，以及他们此刻的弱点是什么。</p>
<p>So in the study of Steps to Knowledge, which is the New Message Book of Practices, you learn how to still the mind so that you may experience the greater power of Knowledge that exists beneath it and all around it. For you were born with two minds. The surface of your mind is the worldly mind, conditioned by your past experience—by all the influences in your life and your responses to them, and the decisions you have made along the way, both consciously and unconsciously, as to how you will participate in the world, and how you will relate to others.</p>
<p>因此，在学习内识进阶——也就是新讯息实践之书的过程中，你将学习如何让心灵平静下来，这样你就能体验到存在于心灵之下和周围的更伟大的内识力量。因为你生来就有两个心灵。你心灵的表面是世俗的心灵，受你过去经验的制约——受你生命中所有影响和你对它们的反应的制约，受你一路上有意或无意地做出的决定的制约，这些决定包括你将如何参与世界，如何与他人相处。</p>
<p>At a deeper level, there is a greater Mind, the Mind that God has placed there, and with it a deeper conscience that knows what is right and what is not, what is true and what is not, and what is right for you and what is not.</p>
<p>在一种更深层次的层面上，存在着一种更伟大的心灵，这个心灵是上帝放置在那里的，它还有一种更深层次的良知，知道什么是对的，什么不是，什么是真实的，什么不是，什么对你来说是正确的，什么不是。</p>
<p>But people live at the surface, as if they were floating on a boat on the ocean. Perhaps they have gained an understanding of the wind and the waves, but they know nothing of the ocean beneath them, and the great life that it contains, and the forces that move this ocean, moving the waters of the world.</p>
<p>但人们生活在表面，就像漂浮在海洋中的小船上。他们或许已经理解了风和海浪，但他们对海洋之下、其中蕴藏的伟大生命以及推动这片海洋、推动世界水域的力量一无所知。</p>
<p>The mind that must be still is the surface mind because that allows you to experience what exists beneath and beyond it. In developing this ability to still the mind, you develop authority over the mind. In a sense, your personal surface mind is searching for a master, and if no master is to be found, it will assume that role itself. But it was not designed to be a master, and it is not masterful; it does not have the quality of mastery. It is meant to be a tool, a medium, a servant for a greater power.</p>
<p>必须静止的心灵是表面的心灵，因为这样你才能体验到存在于心灵之下和之外的内识。在培养这种静止心灵的能力时，你就培养了对心灵的权威。从某种意义上说，你个人的表面心灵正在寻找一位主人，如果找不到主人，它就会自己扮演这个角色。但它并不是为了成为主人而设计的，它也不是主人；它不具备主人的品质。它应该是一种工具、一种媒介、一种更伟大力量的仆人。</p>
<p>Unless Knowledge within you, the deeper Intelligence within you, assumes this greater power as a conscious act on your part, the mind will continue to be chaotic. It will be creative, but not in a beneficial way. It will be repetitive, reinforcing its former beliefs and ideas, reinforcing its fears and its phobias and its dysfunctional behavior. The world around you is showing you the results of this and the evidence of this everywhere you look.</p>
<p>除非你内在的内识，你内在的更深层次的智能，将这种更伟大的力量视为你有意识的行为，否则心灵将继续混乱。它将具有创造性，但不是以一种有益的方式。它将是重复性的，强化它以前的信仰和想法，强化它的恐惧、恐惧症和功能失调的行为。你周围的世界正在向你展示这种情况的结果，以及你目光所及之处的证据。</p>
<p>So developing the still mind allows you to gain control over your mind so that you can direct its great faculties, so that you can use the mind to communicate and to understand and to comprehend things in the world. For your Spirit does not understand the mechanisms of the world; it only knows what the truth is. So you need the intellect to navigate this world successfully, to understand its complications, to understand its enigmas and its contradictions.</p>
<p>因此，培养平静的心灵可以让你控制你的心灵，从而可以控制其伟大的能力，从而可以使用心灵来进行交流、理解和领悟世间万物。因为你的精神不理解世界的机制；它只知道真理是什么。因此，你需要智力来成功地驾驭这个世界，理解它的复杂性、它的谜团和它的矛盾。</p>
<p>For the world beyond your senses is not orderly; it is chaotic. It is governed by the forces of nature—geologic and atmospheric forces, biological forces—but it is very chaotic. People try to find order and balance there, but then life upsets their balance. They face mishap or misfortune, and their whole notion of order and balance is upset.</p>
<p>因为超出你感官的世界不是有序的，而是混乱的。它受自然力量（地质力量、大气力量、生物力量）的支配，但它非常混乱。人们试图在那里找到秩序与平衡，但生命却打破了他们的平衡。他们面临着不幸或厄运，他们对秩序与平衡的整个概念都被打乱了。</p>
<p>If the mind is to serve you, you must gain a certain control over it. And the best way to do this is learning how to still the mind so that you may experience the greater Intelligence beyond it.</p>
<p>如果心灵要为你服务，你必须对它有一定的控制力。而做到这一点的最好方法就是学会如何让心灵平静下来，这样你才能体验到超越心灵的更伟大智能。</p>
<p>A still mind is a perceptive mind. It is through the mind that you can see and hear what other people cannot see and hear. You can sense and discern what others cannot or will not sense and discern.</p>
<p>一个平静的心灵是一个敏锐心灵。正是通过心灵，你可以看到和听到别人看不到和听不到的事物。你可以感知并辨别出别人无法或不愿感知和辨别的事物。</p>
<p>This of course gives you innumerable practical advantages in life. But more importantly, it enables you to discern a real direction for your life, and to have the strength and the discernment to see how vulnerable you are to error and those forces of persuasion around you and within you that would lead you into error and that would harm you as a result.</p>
<p>这当然会给你的生命带来无数实际的优势。但更重要的是，它能让你辨别出你生命的真正方向，并有力量和辨别力去看到你是多么容易犯错误，以及你周围和你内心的说服力量，这些力量会让你犯错，并最终伤害到你。</p>
<p>The mind does not want to be still because it is afraid. Because people are afraid of their minds, they do not want to be still because they are afraid of what they might feel. They might feel the real condition of their life. They might feel their emptiness, and their longing, and their displeasure with so many things that they claim give them happiness.</p>
<p>心灵不想要平静，因为它害怕。因为人们害怕他们的心灵，他们不想平静，因为他们害怕他们可能会有的感觉。他们可能会感受到他们生命的真实状况。他们可能会感到空虚、渴望和不满，因为他们声称这些事情给他们带来了幸福。</p>
<p>So you must have courage to do this because you will feel the condition of your life, you will feel the quality of your relationships and whether they are really appropriate for you at all. You will feel your mental condition, the real condition of your emotions, the state of your body and your health.</p>
<p>因此，你必须有勇气去做这件事，因为你会感受到你的生命状况，你会感受到你关系的质量，以及它们是否真的适合你。你会感受到你的心理状况，你情绪的真实状况，你身体的状况和你的健康状况。</p>
<p>People are running all of the time, overstimulated, overwrought, driven so they will not feel these things. The music is always playing. They are always busy. They are always talking. They are always moving, afraid to sit still, afraid to be with their own real experience.</p>
<p>人们总是在奔波，过度兴奋，过度劳累，过度冲动，这样他们就不会感受到这些事情。音乐一直在播放。他们总是很忙碌。他们总是在说话。他们总是在移动，害怕静坐，害怕面对他们自身的真实体验。</p>
<p>What a slavish life this is, as if you were under constant torment from within yourself, driven to run away from yourself, being a stranger to yourself. Rich or poor, no matter what your circumstances, or your seeming advantages or disadvantages in society, you are really a slave to other forces in this condition.</p>
<p>这是一种多么奴役的生命，仿佛你内心不断受到折磨，被迫逃避你自己，对你自己来说是个陌生人。无论你富有还是贫穷，无论你的处境如何，无论你在社会上的表面优势或劣势如何，在这种情况下，你实际上都是其他力量的奴隶。</p>
<p>That is why stilling the mind gives you peace and reprieve from your own self-torment. As a result, as you begin to approach this, you seek for more quiet in your environment. You seek for more depth in your conversations and communication with others. You seek that which is genuine and deep and meaningful, and find yourself increasingly dissatisfied with the superficial and the trivial.</p>
<p>这就是为什么平静的心灵能让你从你自身的自我折磨中得到安宁和缓解。结果是，当你开始接近这一点时，你会在环境中寻求更多的安静。在与他人的对话和交流中，你会寻求更多的深度。你寻求真诚、深刻和有意义的事情，并发现你自己越来越不满足于肤浅和琐碎之事。</p>
<p>And you find that even your friends do not really know you at all. They only understand, perhaps, your ideas or your behavior, but they really do not perhaps have a sense of your inner life or real nature.</p>
<p>你会发现，甚至你的朋友也根本不知道你。他们也许只理解你的想法或行为，但他们也许真的不知道你的内在生命或真实自然。</p>
<p>Many things come under question here: the value of your work, the value of your health, the meaning of your relations with others. This brings you to the question as to whether you are really living the life you were meant to live. And the answer is real and fundamental. If you ask this question, you may feel the answer even immediately because it is so ever present in your experience.</p>
<p>这里有许多问题：你的工作价值、你的健康价值、你与他人关系的意义。这让你思考你是否真的在过一种你本该过的生命。答案是真实而根本的。如果你问这个问题，你可能会立刻感觉到答案，因为它在你的体验中无处不在。</p>
<p>So the question arises: “How do you still the mind?” You focus on something within it or beyond it. You sit quietly with your eyes closed or slightly open. You have a passive attitude, which means you are not trying to get anything or make anything happen within yourself. You sit comfortably. In Steps to Knowledge, it teaches you to say Na Rahn, or just Rahn, as part of your practice to give your mind something to focus on, a counterpoint to its errant thinking, and constant wandering and imaginings.</p>
<p>因此，问题来了：“你如何让心灵平静下来？”你可以专注于内心或超越内心的事物。你静静地坐着，闭上眼睛或微微睁开。你要有一种被动的态度，这意味着你并不试图在你自己的内心深处得到什么或让什么发生。你坐得很舒服。在内识进阶中，它教你说 Na Rahn，或只是 Rahn，作为你练习的一部分，让你的心灵专注于某件事，与它错误的思维、不断的游移不定和想象形成对比。</p>
<p>You can hear the busyness of the world. There are very few who can be quiet, who can be clear, who can be discerning. Their minds are too busy, moving too fast, thinking, but not really thinking.</p>
<p>你可以听到这个世界的忙碌。很少有人能保持安静，能保持清醒，能明辨是非。他们的心灵太过忙碌，转得太快，在思考，但不是真正的思考。</p>
<p>So when you practice, you practice focusing on something and allow your mind to settle down. If you maintain your focus on a sound or a word or even an object that you look at passively, your mind will begin to settle down, and you will begin to feel deeper things in your experience.</p>
<p>因此，当你练习时，你练习专注于某件事，让你的心灵平静下来。如果你将注意力集中在一个声音、一个单词甚至一个你被动看着的物体上，你的心灵就会开始平静下来，你就会开始在你的体验中感受到更深刻次的事情。</p>
<p>You can even practice this when you are out in the world, when you are waiting for something, when you have a moment to be still. You can still the mind and just listen: listening within and listening without, without any judgment or interpretation. This leads to the experience of the still mind.</p>
<p>你甚至可以在外面、在等待某事、在有片刻静止时练习这个。你可以静下心来，只是倾听：从内而外地倾听，不做任何评判或解释。这可以让你体验到静心。</p>
<p>There is so much time in your day where you could practice this, actually, that is just wasted now in wandering thoughts, in vague imaginings, in fearful scenarios that you dream of. There is so much time and focus wasted that could be brought into this practice.</p>
<p>实际上，你一天中有许多时间可以练习这个，但现在却浪费在了胡思乱想、模糊想象和梦到的可怕场景上。浪费了太多时间和能量，而这些时间和能量本来可以用于这个练习。</p>
<p>You will see that you need a quiet place to practice when you are in meditation. If you are out in the world, you need time to have this experience and to develop these skills. For you do not simply have a still mind just because you want it. You have to develop the skills to bring it about and to sustain it. One of the great benefits of this is whenever you really need to pay attention to something, you can still your mind.</p>
<p>你会看到，当你冥想时，你需要一个安静的地方来练习。如果你在外面，你需要时间来获得这种体验并培养这些技能。因为你不会仅仅因为你想要它而拥有一颗平静的心灵。你必须培养技能来实现它并维持它。这样做的一大好处是，每当你真的需要关注某件事时，你都可以让你的心灵平静下来。</p>
<p>Whenever you are with someone in conversation, it is very important to still your mind so you can hear what they are really communicating, and you can also listen to what you are communicating to see if it is really what you need to be saying and doing in that moment. You are listening in and listening out at the same time. Are you really saying something that is meaningful? Are you really expressing what you want to express? Do you need to say anything at all?</p>
<p>无论何时与某人交谈，保持你心灵的平静都是非常重要的，这样你才能听到他们真正在说什么，你还可以听听你正在说什么，看看这是否真的是你此刻需要说和做的事情。你在倾听的同时也在聆听。你真的在说一些有意义的话吗？你真的在表达你想表达的事情吗？你真的需要说什么吗？</p>
<p>All this constant chattering that people do is such an immense waste of their time and energy. They are missing everything. Even if they think they are being clever and socially acceptable, they are missing so much. They might as well be talking to themselves. They might as well be talking to a tree or to a wall or to a stone.</p>
<p>人们总是喋喋不休，极大地浪费了他们的时间和能量。他们错过了一切。即使他们认为他们是聪明的，被社会所接受，他们也错过了许多事情。他们还不如自言自语。他们还不如对着一棵树、一堵墙或一块石头说话。</p>
<p>When you still your mind, you can hear and feel people’s real condition. You see beyond charm, you see beyond pretense, you see beyond social behavior, you see how uncomfortable people really are, and you see how insecure people really are. Even if they pretend to be powerful and dominating, you see how fear driven they really are. You begin to see things that you never saw before. Powerful people do not look so powerful anymore. And you look for deeper qualities in everyone you meet.</p>
<p>当你的心灵平静时，你就能听到并感受到人们的真实状况。你能看到魅力之外的事情，你能看到伪装之外的事情，你能看到社交行为之外的事情，你会看到人们实际上是多么的不舒服，你会看到人们实际上是多么的缺乏安全感。即使他们假装强大和霸道，你也会看到他们实际上是多么的恐惧。你开始看到你以前从未看到的事情。强大的人看起来不再那么强大了。你会在你遇到的每个人身上寻找更深层次的品质。</p>
<p>Because you want to experience this power of discernment, you want your mind to be still so it is not obstructing your discernment, it is not interfering with what you are focused upon. You seek quiet at home because you need time to listen.</p>
<p>因为你想体验这种辨别力，所以你希望你的心灵静止，这样它就不会妨碍你的辨别力，也不会干扰你关注的事情。你在家里寻求安静，因为你需要时间去倾听。</p>
<p>You then see the importance of being aware of where you are and what you are doing and what you are experiencing—an awareness that you just would not have otherwise. You would just go through your day in a kind of state of suspended awareness, not really knowing where you are, what you are doing and what is happening around you with any depth whatsoever.</p>
<p>这样，你就会看到并察觉到你身在何处、正在做什么以及正在经历什么的重要性——否则，你就不会有这种觉知。你只是在一种悬浮意识的状态下度过每一天，无法真正深入地知道你在哪里、在做什么以及周围发生了什么。</p>
<p>Conversations are long and pointless. Your interactions with people are frustrating and shallow. And even if someone is with you, are they really with you?</p>
<p>谈话冗长而毫无意义。你与他人的互动令人沮丧且肤浅。即使有人和你在一起，他们真的和你在一起吗？</p>
<p>This requires real courage, of course, because you must be willing to face whatever is there, the truth of whatever is there. And the truth is not an idea, or a concept, or a theory. It is simply what is there. Now you are beginning to experience Knowledge, which is the experience of reality—a reality at all levels, at the surface and deeper. But to experience this, you must be spending a lot of time looking without a lot of errant thinking—a still mind.</p>
<p>当然，这需要真正的勇气，因为你必须愿意面对一切，面对一切的真理。而真理不是一种想法、概念或理论。它只是存在的内识。现在你开始体验内识，也就是对现实的体验——一种在所有层面、在表面和更深层次上的现实。但是，要体验到这一点，你必须花大量的时间去观察，且没有太多错误的思维——保持一颗平静的心。</p>
<p>The mind is either a window or a wall. To see through it, it must be quiet and transparent. Otherwise, it is like a shell that you live within—afraid of it, driven by it, overwhelmed by it, intimidated by it.</p>
<p>心灵要么是一扇窗户，要么是一堵墙。要想看透它，心灵就必须保持安静和透明。否则，它就像你生活在其中的一个躯壳——害怕它、被它驱使、被它压倒、被它吓倒。</p>
<p>The other part of the problem here is that in the course of life, people have picked up so much pollution from the world around them—from the media, from movies, from stories and from real life experiences. There is so much contamination, so much anger, so much tragedy, so much violence, so much degradation. People are polluted. Internally they are polluted; their mind is full of toxic things.</p>
<p>问题的另一部分是，在生命中，人们从周围的世界——从媒体、电影、故事以及来自真实的生命体验——中吸收了太多的污染。有太多的污染、太多的愤怒、太多的悲剧、太多的暴力、太多的堕落。人们被污染了。他们的内心被污染了；他们的心灵充满了有毒的事物。</p>
<p>So when you begin your meditation, you begin to feel these toxic things, and it is really hard to face because you find that what is in your mind can be terrible, awful. And you also find you have images from movies you saw years ago, images that haunt you and make you feel afraid or upset. You find you have irresolution with people from the past. You find you have resentments towards certain people—even resentment towards people you knew long ago, like your parents or other family members. It is all pollution in the mind.</p>
<p>所以当你开始冥想时，你开始感受到这些有毒的事物，这真的很难面对，因为你会发现你心灵中的事物可能很可怕、很糟糕。你还会发现你的心灵中浮现出多年前看过的电影的画面，这些画面萦绕在你的心灵中，让你感到害怕或不安。你会发现你对过去的人无法释怀。你会发现你对某些人怀有怨恨——甚至对很久以前认识的人怀有怨恨，比如你的父母或其他家庭成员。这都是心灵中的污染。</p>
<p>So for the mind to be a window and not a wall, it must be cleaned and cleared. So as these things come into your awareness, you say, “I release this now, for it is no longer meaningful to me,” and you experience letting it go, sending it down a long river until it is out of sight.</p>
<p>因此，为了让心灵成为一扇窗户而不是一堵墙，它必须被清理干净。因此，当这些事情进入你的觉知时，你会说：“我现在放弃它，因为它对我不再有意义了”，然后你就会体验到放下它，让它顺着一条长长河流流逝，直到它消失在视野之外。</p>
<p>Sometimes you must take action to resolve these things: communicating with people you have resented, or taking some other kind of resolving actions that will help you in this matter. But much of this pollution is simply the imagery of life, imagery that your culture and the media have put into your mind, contaminating your mind.</p>
<p>有时你必须采取行动来解决这些问题：与你怨恨的人沟通，或采取其他有助于你解决问题的行动。但这些污染大多只是生命的意象​​，是你的文化和媒体植入你心中的意象，污染了你的心灵。</p>
<p>As you practice stillness, these things have less and less appeal, and less and less of a hold upon you. Even your greatest fears or phobias begin to lose their power over you as you continue your practice in stillness and observation.</p>
<p>随着你练习静止，这些事物的吸引力会越来越小，对你的吸引力也会越来越小。随着你继续练习静止和观察，即使是你最大的恐惧或恐惧症也会开始失去对你的控制。</p>
<p>The pollution takes real time to be cleansed from your mind. And you see how important it is to control what comes into your mind, far more than you have in the past. You do not want to watch movies now, unless they are really essential for your awareness. You want to really be careful what you take into your mind, what you expose yourself to and [see] if it is really meaningful and necessary or not.</p>
<p>清除心灵中的污染需要花费很长时间。你会看到，控制进入心灵的事物是多么重要，比过去重要得多。你现在不想看电影，除非它们对你的觉知真的很重要。你要非常小心，你要把什么带入你的心灵，你要让你自己接触什么，看看它是否真的有意义和必要。</p>
<p>You want to be very careful what you tell yourself, for honesty and dishonesty both begin with what you tell yourself. Listen to what you tell yourself, and see if it is really true or if it is merely a habit or a part of your conditioning. Listen to what you tell other people to see if it is really true: “Am I really speaking the truth or am I just saying something for any other reason?”</p>
<p>你要非常小心地告诉你自己的话，因为诚实和不诚实都始于你告诉你自己什么。听听你告诉你自己的话，看看它是否是真的，还是只是你的习惯或条件的一部分。听听你告诉别人的话，看看它是否是真的：“我真的在说真理，还是我只是出于其他原因说了些什么？”</p>
<p>Listen. Watch. Become aware of what you say and what you think and what you tell yourself, and what others tell themselves. You will see the nature of real self-deception. And you will see again how necessary it is for you to find freedom from this, and to cleanse your mind and your life of those things that do not belong in it, that are corrupting it and polluting it.</p>
<p>倾听。观察。察觉到你说了什么、想了什么、对你自己说了什么以及其他人对他们自己说了什么。你会看到真正的自我欺骗的本质。你也会再次看到，摆脱这种自我欺骗是多么必要，清除你的心灵和生命中那些不属于它、腐蚀它、污染它的事物是多么必要。</p>
<p>Here you are able to experience a state of mind that is neither hopeful nor fearful. It is not a state of mind that is angry. It is not a state of mind that is possessed. It is not a state of mind that is driven by desires and needs and anxieties.</p>
<p>在这里，你能够体验一种既不抱希望也不恐惧的心灵状态。它不是一种愤怒的心灵状态。它不是一种着魔的心灵状态。它不是一种被欲望、需求和焦虑所驱使的心灵状态。</p>
<p>It is remarkably observant. It is fully present. It is engaged with life because it is present to life. It is careful and discerning, but it is not defensive. It is looking for what is meaningful. It is letting everything else pass by. Here you do not need to be disgusted with the world, or disgusted with people, or disgusted with anything, for you are looking for what is real and true.</p>
<p>它观察力非凡。它是完全在场的。它参与生命，因为它存在于生命之中。它小心翼翼，明察秋毫，但它并不防御。它在寻找有意义的事物。它让其他一切擦肩而过。在这里，你不需要厌恶世界，不需要厌恶人们，也不需要厌恶任何事物，因为你正在寻找真正和真实的内识。</p>
<p>It is like looking for the fruit on the tree. The fruit is only a very small part of the tree, but you are looking for that. You are looking for wisdom in others. You are looking for inspiration in others. You are looking for what is true in others, and what they are communicating that is really true. You want to experience and see their real condition and not be swayed or mesmerized by how they present themselves.</p>
<p>它就像在树上寻找果实。果实只是树的很小一部分，但你正在寻找它。你正在寻找他人的智慧。你正在寻找他人的灵感。你正在寻找他人身上的真理，以及他们所传达的真正真理。你想体验和看到他们的真实状况，而不是被他们表现他们自己的方式所左右或迷惑。</p>
<p>You do not want to be fooled by beauty or wealth or charm, for they are deceptive and destructive to you if you cannot see through them. You do not want to be deceived, you do not want to be obsessed, you do not want to be overwhelmed, and so you exercise the power of seeing, which requires that you have a still mind.</p>
<p>你不想被美貌、财富或魅力所欺骗，因为如果你不能看穿它们，它们对你来说就是欺骗和破坏。你不想被欺骗，你不想被迷惑，你不想被压倒，所以你要锻炼观察的能力，这需要你有一颗静止的心灵。</p>
<p>Sometimes when you practice, the mind just will not settle down, and so if that is the case, you simply start to think about something else. You contemplate something that is important for you. You think about part of the teaching in the New Message. You think about the wisdom of your decisions regarding what you are planning to do and what you have already chosen.</p>
<p>有时当你练习时，心灵就是无法平静下来，如果是这种情况，你就开始思考其他事情。你沉思对你来说很重要的事情。你思考新讯息中的部分教导。你思考你计划做什么和已经做什么的决定是否明智。</p>
<p>You employ the mind to consider something meaningful and valuable, instead of being a helpless victim of wherever it wants to go. So if the mind will not settle down in your meditation, you use the mind for contemplation. You see, you are exercising authority here. In either case, you are exercising authority. And you are doing something very useful, beneficial and productive.</p>
<p>你用心灵去思考一些有意义和有价值的事情，而不是无助地随波逐流。因此，如果心灵在冥想中无法安定下来，你就用心灵去沉思。你看，你在这里行使权威。无论哪种情况，你都在行使权威。而且你正在做一些非常有用、有益和富有成效的事情。</p>
<p>If there are traumas in your life that have to be resolved, you might need professional help. But ultimately you must release things that are obsessing you, and you must gain authority over your mind to do this. If there is no authority, then you can only hope and wish, and hoping and wishing are not strong enough to overcome years of habitual thinking and behavior.</p>
<p>如果你的生命中有一些创伤需要解决，你可能需要专业的帮助。但最终你必须释放那些困扰你的事情，你必须控制你的心灵才能做到这一点。如果没有权威，那么你只能希望和期盼，而希望和期盼不足以克服多年的习惯性思维和行为。</p>
<p>You must be the captain of your ship. Your thoughts are your crew. Your body is your vessel. You cannot be a slave to your crew. You cannot allow a mutiny to happen. Here you exercise authority over the mind and the body because you are given this as part of your responsibility.</p>
<p>你必须成为你这艘船的船长。你的心灵就是你的船员。你的身体就是你的船体。你不能成为船员的奴隶。你不能允许叛变发生。在这里，你对心灵和身体行使权威，因为这是你责任的一部分。</p>
<p>With a still mind, you can begin to hear the voices of your Teachers who speak to you now and then. You are hearing guidance even as you are doing things. They are sending thoughts into your mind. If your mind is clear and if you are present and aware, you can hear this and feel this and take action upon this, which are so necessary for making wise decisions in the moment.</p>
<p>有了一个静止的心灵，你便能开始听到不时与你对话的老师的声音。你甚至在做事时也在听从指导。他们将思想发送到你的心灵中。如果你的心灵清晰，如果你在场且有察觉，你就能听到这些、感受到这些并采取行动，而这些对于当下做出明智的决定而言非常必要。</p>
<p>Here you begin to feel and experience signs within yourself and signs within the world, telling you what you need to know, advising you, counseling you. You do this without fantasy, without preference and without fear. You just sense the way things must go and what to do and what not to do in certain situations.</p>
<p>在这里，你开始感受到并体验到你内在的迹象和世界里的迹象，它们告诉你需要知道的事情，给你建议，给你忠告。你这样做时没有幻想，没有偏好，也没有恐惧。你只是感觉到事情必须如何发展，以及在某些情况下该做什么和不该做什么。</p>
<p>Everything We are presenting here represents a set of skills that must be cultivated over time. You cannot simply wish for them and have them become really functional in your life. You have to build the skills. You have to repattern the mind, redirect the mind, learn how to respond differently to the world and where to seek for guidance and counsel within yourself.</p>
<p>我们在这里介绍的一切都代表着一套必须经过长期培养的技能。你不能简单地希望它们在你的生命中真正发挥作用。你必须培养这些技能。你必须重塑心灵，改变心灵的方向，学会如何以不同的方式应对世界，以及在哪里寻求你自己的指导和建议。</p>
<p>It all really involves a deep evaluation of your inner life—your thoughts, your feelings, your goals, your wishes, your fears and your restraints—and your outer life—where you live, how you live, who you are with and what you are doing and what you need to be doing that you are not doing.</p>
<p>这一切实际上都涉及对你的内在生命——你的思想、你的感受、你的目标、你的愿望、你的恐惧和你的克制——以及你的外在生命——你住在哪里、你如何生活、你和谁在一起、你在做什么以及你需要做但你没有做什么——的深刻评估。</p>
<p>All this in time takes place because you are learning to still your mind and to be with your deeper experience. It is a tremendous thing to undertake, and that is why Steps to Knowledge has been given and that is why there are many Steps and not only a few because you are taking a journey from one state of mind to another.</p>
<p>这一切都会及时发生，因为你正在学习静止你的心灵，并与你更深层次的体验相共存。这是一项艰巨的任务，这就是为什么内识进阶被赋予，这就是为什么会有许多步骤，而不是只有几个，因为你正在从一种心灵状态走向另一种心灵状态。</p>
<p>You are learning to shift your authority from your social conditioning and your fearful habits to the power and presence of Knowledge within yourself. You are shifting your discernment of others from superficial things to things that are really meaningful and consequential.</p>
<p>你正在学习将你的权威从你的社会条件和你的恐惧习惯转移到你内在内识的力量和存在。你正在将你对他人的辨别力从肤浅的事物转移到真正有意义和影响的事物。</p>
<p>In every decision you make, it is what informs that decision, and where you seek your counsel, and what influences your thinking and your actions [that are important].</p>
<p>在你做出的每一个决定中，它都会影响到决定，你会从哪里寻求建议，什么都会影响你的思维和行为，这些都很重要。</p>
<p>You take this journey, and it is a great one. You will not experience great success in a day or a week or a month, but you will be moving in a positive direction. Your emphasis in life will begin to change, your experience of life will begin to shift, and you will begin to experience what you have always been experiencing, but what you could not recognize before.</p>
<p>你踏上了这段旅程，这是一段伟大的旅程。你不会在一天、一周或一个月内取得伟大成功，但你会朝着积极的方向前进。你对生命的重视将开始改变，你的生命体验将开始转变，你将开始体验你一直在经历但以前无法认识到的事情。</p>
<p>The still mind is at the center of this study and this great education in The Way of Knowledge. There is nothing more important for you to do right now, and anything else that is important must have this as its foundation to be really effective. Then you will begin to feel what you must do, and you will find the strength to do those things that you could not seem to do before. And you will find the clarity to escape ambivalence and confusion.</p>
<p>静止的心灵是内识之路中这项研究和伟大教育的核心。现在没有什么比这更重要的事情了，其他任何重要的事情都必须以此为基础才能真正有效。然后你就会开始感觉到你必须做什么，你会找到力量去做那些你以前似乎做不到的事情。你会找到摆脱矛盾和困惑的清晰道路。</p>
<p>For you will see through your own inner experience and through the genuine expression of others what is really true and what is not true. You will finally feel like you have power and direction in your life. This will restore to you your self-confidence over time, the sense of value of your life and the realization that you are here for a greater purpose—a greater purpose that is waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>因为你将通过你自身的内在体验、通过他人的真诚表达，看到什么是真实的，什么不是真实的。你最终会感觉到你在生命中拥有力量和方向。随着时间的推移，这将恢复你的自信、你生命的价值感和你在这里为了一个更伟大目的的认知——一个正等待被发现的更伟大目的。</p>
<p>Let this be your understanding.</p>
<p>让这成为你的理解。</p>
