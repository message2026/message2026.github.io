<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on December 8, 2009 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia<br>2009 年 12 月 8 日，在柬埔寨金边(Phnom Penh, Cambodia)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At times an Inner Voice will speak to you. It will speak to you beneath the surface of your mind, speaking from the background. You will not quite know what voice this is because it does not really sound like the kind of voice you listen to within your mind normally. It is a Voice that will give you brief instructions without explanations, directing you or holding you back.</p>
<p>有时，内心的声音会对你说话。它会在你的心灵表面之下、从背景中对你说话。你不太清楚这是什么声音，因为它听起来并不像你通常在心灵中聆听的那种声音。这个声音会给你简短的指示，不带任何解释，既不会指引你，也不会阻止你。</p>
<p>You will wonder: “Is this coming from me or from someone else?” In a way, it is coming from you, but it is coming from a part of you that you are barely acquainted with, a part of you that is deep beneath the surface of your mind, the part of you called Knowledge.</p>
<p>你会感到疑惑：“这是来自我，还是来自另一个人？”从某种意义上说，它来自你，但它来自一个你几乎不熟悉的一部分，来自你心灵深处的一部分，你称之为内识的一部分。</p>
<p>This Voice will not have a conversation with you. You cannot pester it with questions, for it will just recede into the Mystery. And where it goes you cannot yet go, for you have not yet learned the way and have not taken a sufficient number of Steps to Knowledge.</p>
<p>这个声音不会和你对话。你无法用问题来烦扰它，因为它只会退缩到神秘之中。而它去的地方你还不能去，因为你还没有学会道路，还没有迈出足够多的通向内识的步伐。</p>
<p>In a way, it is the Voice of your deeper conscience. Not your social conscience. Not what your parents taught you or society taught you or your religion may have taught you. But a deeper sense of what is correct and incorrect; what is appropriate, what is inappropriate; what is helpful and what is harmful.</p>
<p>在某种程度上，这是你内心更深层次良知的声音。而不是你的社会良知。不是你的父母教给你的、社会教给你的或你的宗教教给你的良知。而是对什么是正确和不正确的、什么是合适的、什么是不合适的、什么是有益的、什么是有害的更深层次的感觉。</p>
<p>But people have maligned the idea of conscience. They associate it with guilt. They think certain things and do certain things and feel bad about it. In a way, they are violating Knowledge, and that is why they feel bad. But then this becomes an excuse for not wanting to engage in one’s deeper conscience at all, which lays you open and vulnerable to all forms of persuasion and dangerous inducements.</p>
<p>但人们已经诋毁了良心的想法。他们把良心与罪恶感联系在一起。他们想某些事情，做某些事情，并为此感到难过。在某种程度上，他们违背了内识，这就是他们感到难过的原因。但这样一来，难受就成为了一个借口，让人根本不想接触这种更深层次的良知，从而使你处于开放的状态，容易受到各种形式的劝说和危险的引诱。</p>
<p>If you practice stillness as it is taught in Steps to Knowledge, you will begin to experience this Inner Voice. It will seem very quiet and very muted because you are not used to hearing a Voice that comes from this deep within yourself. Its directions will be very simple, and they will not come with explanations. You either follow them or you do not. It is the deeper Voice within you.</p>
<p>如果你按照《内识进阶》中教导的那样练习静止，你就会开始体验到这种内心声音。它会显得非常安静和低沉，因为你不习惯听到来自你内心深处的声音。它的指示非常简单，不会附带任何解释。你要么遵循它们，要么不遵循。它是你内心更深层次的声音。</p>
<p>It is not really even the voice of your Teachers, who watch over your life and send instructions into your mind periodically to help you. It is not their voice. But it is true that you may, on very rare occasions, hear the voice of one of your Teachers speaking to you. A voice like my voice, for example, or something very similar. A voice that is not your voice, distinctly not your voice.</p>
<p>它实际上甚至不是你老师的声音，他们关注着你的生命，并定期向你的心灵发送指令来帮助你。内识不是他们的声音。但确实，在极少数情况下，你可能会听到你的老师之一对你说话的声音。例如，像我的声音，或非常相似的声音。一种不是你的声音，显然不是你的声音。</p>
<p>We do not encourage speculation about this because there are many influences in the mental environment, and not all of them are beneficial. So if you start believing in every voice you hear, you will be in great danger. Much of what you hear in your mind is what you tell yourself. It is a  conversation you have with yourself. It is your mind telling itself something. You have to watch this carefully because honesty and dishonesty begin with what you tell yourself. Sometimes you can trace the source of your error in thinking or your mistake of understanding to what you tell yourself.</p>
<p>我们不鼓励对此进行猜测，因为心理环境中存在许多影响，而且并非所有影响都是有益的。因此，如果你开始相信你听到的每一个声音，你将处于极大的危险之中。你在心灵中听到的大部分内容都是你告诉你自己的。这是你与你自己的对话。这是你的心灵在告诉它自己一些事情。你必须仔细观察这一点，因为诚实和不诚实都始于你告诉你自己的话。有时，你可以将你思维错误或理解错误的根源追溯到你告诉你自己的话。</p>
<p>Perhaps there is someone else in your life who is a powerful influence who would say something like this to you, but you say it to yourself as if you have been trained and conditioned to say this thing to yourself, whether it be true or not.</p>
<p>也许在你的生命中有另一个人对你有着强大的影响力，他会对你说这样的话，但你却对你自己说，好像你已经被训练好了，有条件对你自己说这样的话，不管它是真是假。</p>
<p>But We are speaking of an Inner Voice; it is not what you tell yourself. It has nothing to do with your attempt to have what you want; or to persuade yourself to do something that you really do not want to do; or to give justification for something that is incorrect; or to blame other people and so forth. The Inner Voice just gives direction.</p>
<p>但我们谈论的是内心的声音；它不是你告诉你自己的话。它与你试图得到你想要的东西无关；与说服你自己去做你真正不想做的事情无关；与为错误的事情辩解无关；与责怪其他人等等无关。内心的声音只是给出方向。</p>
<p>Amazingly, this Inner Voice is actually speaking to you far more than you are aware of, but your mind is so caught up in the outside—in your own thinking and in being stimulated and driven and busy—that you cannot hear or feel this Inner Voice. So you are missing the vast percentage of its wisdom and direction. It just is not making it up into your awareness. That is why in the study of Steps to Knowledge, you practice stillness so you can listen and feel and develop a deeper sensitivity, both within yourself and within the world at large.</p>
<p>令人惊奇的是，这个内在声音实际上比你察觉到的要多得多，但你的心灵却如此沉迷于外部世界——沉迷于你自身的思维、受到刺激、被驱使并陷入忙碌之中——以至于你无法听到或感受到这个内在声音。所以你错过了它的大部分智慧和指导。它只是没有进入你的觉知。这就是为什么在学习《内识进阶》时，你要练习静止，这样你才能倾听和感受，并培养更深层次的敏感性，无论是在你内心还是在世界范围内。</p>
<p>The Inner Voice is sacred. If you experience it, you should not discuss it with your friends. Do not make it a subject of idle conversation. Follow it. See where it takes you. Allow the potency of this experience to build for you.</p>
<p>内心的声音是神圣的。如果你体验到了它，你不应该和你的朋友讨论它。不要把它当作闲聊的话题。追随它。看看它会带你去哪里。允许这种体验的效力为你建立。</p>
<p>You are receiving direction because direction is necessary in a world of constant change and adaptation. And the decisions you make, even on a simple basis, day to day, have a bearing on what you experience when you are out there in the world and how you feel within yourself.</p>
<p>你正在接受指引，因为在这个不断变化和适应的世界中，指引是必需的。你每天所做的决定，即使是简单的决定，也会影响你在外面世界的经历以及你的内心感受。</p>
<p>No one feels very good if they are disconnected from the power and presence of Knowledge because they are disconnected and disassociated from their deeper nature. People who do this have a very shallow feeling about their lives and are prone to depression, and self-retribution, guilt, shame, confusion, and frustration because they are not connected to their deeper nature, which is Knowledge.</p>
<p>没有人会因为与内识的力量和存在脱节而感觉良好，因为他们与来自他们更深层次的自然脱节、分离。这样做的人对他们的生命有一种非常肤浅的感觉，容易抑郁、自我惩罚、内疚、羞愧、困惑和沮丧，因为他们没有与他们更深层次的自然，也就是内识相联接。</p>
<p>One of the reasons that people avoid this is they do not want to hear something that they do not want to do. They do not want something to be given to them that will ask them to do something they do not want to do or to stop doing something they do want to do.  It becomes the reason that people do not want to listen within themselves.</p>
<p>人们回避这一点的原因之一是他们不想听到他们不想做的事情。他们不想有人给他们一些东西，让他们做他们不想做的事情，或者停止做他们想做的事情。这成为人们不想倾听他们自己内心的原因。</p>
<p>But amazingly, it is hearing the Inner Voice directing you, telling you to do something you do not want to do or not to do something you do want to do that proves its reality and demonstrates that there is a greater Voice within you that is not governed by your preferences. It is not a trick; you are not making this up. Knowledge is more powerful than your intellect. It is not conditioned by your thinking, your fears, or your preferences. So it is the one true thing that can guide you.</p>
<p>但令人惊奇的是，听到内心的声音指引你，告诉你去做你不想做的事情或不去做你想做的事情，这证明了它的真实性，并表明你内心有一个更伟大的声音，不受你的偏好的支配。它不是一个诡计；你不是在编造。内识比你的智力更强大。它不受你的思维、你的恐惧或你的偏好的制约。因此，它是能够指引你的唯一真理。</p>
<p>People often deny the experience of this until something really big happens in their life and they have to make a huge decision. They hear that there is Knowledge within them, and so they try to make a huge decision with it. But they have not built the bridge between their thinking surface mind and their deeper Mind of Knowledge. So they get a confusion of thoughts and fears and images, but nothing really authentic. And if they do get something authentic, it is so mixed with other things that they cannot tell it from everything else.</p>
<p>人们经常否认这种体验，直到他们生命中发生了一些真正重大的事情，他们不得不做出重大决定。他们听说他们内心的内识，所以他们试图用它做出重大决定。但他​​们没有在他们思维的表面心灵和他们更深层次的内识心灵之间建立桥梁。所以他们得到了思想、恐惧和形象的混乱，但没有真正真实的事情。如果他们确实得到了一些真实的东西，它与其他东西混杂在一起，以至于他们无法将它与其他一切区分开来。</p>
<p>So they are guessing. And guessing is a very weak position. It is a very dangerous behavior to be guessing. When certainty can be yours, why would you be guessing? It is dangerous. If you find yourself guessing in the face of an important decision, you had better stop and not take any action unless immediate action is necessary, such as in an extreme emergency.</p>
<p>因此，他们在猜测。而猜测会处于一种非常软弱的位置。猜测是一种非常危险的行为。当你可以确定的时候，你为什么要猜测呢？它是危险的。如果你发现你自己在面对一个重要的决定时在猜测，你最好停下来，不要采取任何行动，除非需要立即采取行动，比如在极端的紧急情况下。</p>
<p>But if it is not this, then you had better stop and listen. Pay attention to your deeper experience. Stop this nagging questioning of your mind, and be with your deeper experience. If you do this, well, you may hear this Inner Voice speaking to you.</p>
<p>但如果不是这样，那么你最好停下来听一听。关注你更深层次的体验。停止你心灵中这种喋喋不休的质问，与你更深层次的体验在一起。如果你这样做，那么，你可能会听到内心的声音在对你说话。</p>
<p>Another problem for certain people is that they hear the voices of others speaking to them—the voice of their mother, the voice of their father, the voice of some other influential person in their life. And they either resist this voice or they follow it dutifully, but in either case, they are not really responding to their own Inner Voice. They are responding to their conditioning. They are responding to what has been programmed into their minds.</p>
<p>某些人的另一个问题是，他们听到其他人在对他们说话——他们母亲的声音、他们父亲的声音、他们生命中其他有影响力的人的声音。他们要么抵制这种声音，要么忠实地听从它，但无论哪种情况，他们都没有真正回应他们自身的内在声音。他们只是在回应他们的条件反射。他们只是在回应已经编入他们心灵的事情。</p>
<p>Without a connection to Knowledge, how can you use Knowledge to make a big decision? If you experience its response at all, it will be all mixed up with your fears and preferences and ideas and so forth. And then you will be guessing. It is not a position of experiencing and recognizing certainty.</p>
<p>如果没有一种与内识的联接，你如何能够使用内识做出重大决定？如果你体验到它的回应，那它将和你的恐惧、偏好、想法等等混杂在一起。然后你就会猜测。这不是一个体验和认知确定性的位置。</p>
<p>That is why the study in Steps to Knowledge is so fundamental, you see, because you must stop guessing about life and start listening and paying attention, paying attention on the outside, watching without judgment. Listening, looking, discerning, feeling those things that influence you, recognizing those tendencies in your own mind that are governing your thinking. People are so conditioned by their families and cultures, they can barely even think for themselves.</p>
<p>这就是为什么《内识进阶》的学习如此重要，因为你必须停止对生命的猜测，开始倾听和关注，关注外部，不加评判地观察。倾听、观察、辨别、感受那些影响你的事物，认识到你自身心灵中那些控制你思维的倾向。人们深受家庭和文化的影响，几乎无法独立思考。</p>
<p>But the Inner Voice is something very special. It is infrequent. It is not what you tell yourself. It is coming from a deeper place within you altogether. And if you do not follow it, well, how will you ever know if it is true or not?  How will you ever know if it is really effective or not?</p>
<p>但内心的声音非常特别。它并不常见。它不是你告诉你自己的话。它来自你的内心深处。如果你不听从它，你怎么知道它是真的还是假的？你怎么知道它是否真的有效？</p>
<p>The Inner Voice will counsel you regarding simple things that are valuable to know or to do but do not represent great decisions before you. You have to be successful with the simpler things first and build up your strength here.</p>
<p>内心的声音会就一些简单的事情给你建议，这些事情值得你去知道或去做，但并不代表你要做重大的决定。你必须先成功处理简单的事情，然后在此基础上增强你的实力。</p>
<p>In this regard, the most difficult decisions people have are regarding their relationships: disappointing people, fear of disapproval, fear of the guilt one would feel if they made a mistake in relationship to someone or something. So people will tie themselves into knots over their anxiety about someone else’s response to what they say. That is why the Inner Voice is so important because it is not governed or influenced by these forces. But these forces can obliterate your awareness, preoccupy you, and make hearing the Inner Voice more difficult.</p>
<p>在这方面，人们最难做出的决定与人际关系有关：让人失望、害怕他人的不赞同、害怕自己在与某人或某事的关系中犯错而感到内疚。因此，人们会因为担心别人对他们自己所说的话的反应而陷入困境。这就是为什么内心的声音如此重要，因为它不受这些力量的支配或影响。但这些力量会抹杀你的觉知，让你心神不宁，让你更难听到内心的声音。</p>
<p>In relationship, you see, at the deeper level of Knowledge, it is not about beauty, wealth and charm. It is about recognition and purpose together. You do not have to constantly query yourself as to whether this person is the right person because you feel the possibility. But the possibility is not yet a certainty because you do not know if the person is ready. You do not even know if you are ready.</p>
<p>你看，在关系中，在更深层次层面的内识中，它不是关于美貌、财富和魅力。它是关于共同的认知和目的。你不必不断地问你自己这个人是否是合适的人，因为你感觉到了这种可能性。但这种可能性还不是确定的，因为你不知道这个人是否准备好了。你甚至不知道你是否准备好了。</p>
<p>Destiny does not mean that you are ready. To meet a person who has a greater calling with you prematurely is really a difficult situation and requires great restraint. It is a situation where you may feel tremendous disappointment and frustration. Something feels so right to be with this person, but you cannot be with them because of their circumstances or because they are overtaken by their own inner problems or conflicts. You made your rendezvous, but they were not ready, or you were not ready.</p>
<p>天命并不意味着你已经准备好了。过早地遇到一个对你有更伟大召唤的人确实是一个困难的情况，需要伟大的克制。在这种情况下，你可能会感到极大的失望和沮丧。和这个人在一起感觉很好，但你不能和他们在一起，因为他们的情况，或者因为他们被他们自身的内在问题或冲突所困扰。你约好了，但他们还没有准备好，或者你还没有准备好。</p>
<p>You are not ready to have a relationship of this magnitude alter the course of your life, change your focus and priorities, strengthen your connection to Knowledge and to the greater path you must find and follow. These are the relationships of destiny, and they represent great turning points in your life, but you must be ready.</p>
<p>你还没有准备好让这种规模的关系改变你的生命历程，改变你的焦点和优先事项，加强你和内识的联接，以及和你必须找到并遵循的更伟大道路的联接。这些是天命的关系，它们代表着你生命中的伟大转折点，但你必须做好准备。</p>
<p>Then there is the question of asking for guidance. People are very confused about this because they ask about something, and then they expect an immediate answer. And if they do not get an answer within five minutes, they think that nothing is happening, and they go back into guessing—trying to work it out intellectually, which is just a fancy way of saying guessing. You use your intellect to solve practical or mechanical problems. But in terms of discerning relationships, it makes a very poor guide.</p>
<p>然后是寻求指导的问题。人们对此非常困惑，因为他们询问某事，然后期望立即得到答案。如果他们在五分钟内没有得到答案，他们会认为什么都没有发生，然后又开始猜测——试图用智力解决问题，这只是猜测的一种花哨说法。你用你的智力来解决实际或机械问题。但在辨别关系方面，它是一个非常糟糕的指导。</p>
<p>To ask a question of Knowledge, you must formulate the question in such a way that only a yes or a no can be the answer, not an explanation. There can be no trick questions here. It has to be an honest question. If you want to experience the authentic response, it must be a question posed in such a way that Knowledge can direct you.</p>
<p>要向内识提问，你必须以这样一种方式提出问题，即答案只能是“肯定”或“否定”，而不是解释。这里不能有花招问题。它必须是一个诚实的问题。如果你想体验真实的回应，它必须是一个以内识可以指导你的方式提出的问题。</p>
<p>Many people ask questions where nothing can direct them because they are not starting at the beginning. They say: “Should I become intimate with this person?” But that is not the first question. The first question is: “Should I even be in a relationship with this person? Should I even be with this person?” People may ask: “Should I go to this place on my vacation?” But that is not the first question. The first question is should you even go on a vacation? And if so, what are the options?</p>
<p>许多人问的问题都是无从下手的，因为他们没有从头开始。他们说：“我应该和这个人变得亲密吗？”但这不是第一个问题。第一个问题是：“我应该和这个人建立关系吗？我应该和这个人在一起吗？”人们可能会问：“我度假时应该去这个地方吗？”但这不是第一个问题。第一个问题是你应该去度假吗？如果是的话，有什么选择？</p>
<p>Everything is posed in such a way that it is a yes or a no, so that you have the greatest possibility of experiencing the answer at a deeper level. Not at the level of ideas, not at the level of having a conversation with yourself, but at a deeper level. You pose the question, and you live with the question, and you keep asking the question, and you keep listening. You do not get the answer right away in many times, in many situations, because you are not listening yet.</p>
<p>一切都以“是”或“否”的方式提出，这样你就有最大的可能在更深层次的层面上体验到答案。不是在想法的层面，不是在与你自己对话的层面，而是在一种更深层次的层面上。你提出问题，带着问题生活，你不断问问题，你不断倾听。在很多时候，在很多情况下，你不会立即得到答案，因为你还没有倾听。</p>
<p>Part of your spiritual practice is to listen. It is a focus. You listen not to get an immediate response, but to practice developing the skill of listening because it is this skill that enables you to hear the Inner Voice ever increasingly.</p>
<p>聆听是精神练习的一部分。它是一种专注。聆听不是为了立即得到回应，而是为了练习培养聆听的技能，因为这种技能能让你不断听到内心的声音。</p>
<p>Because you cannot bargain with Knowledge, or make a deal of some kind, you will have to really come to it in a very honest and open fashion. This will change the way you relate to yourself and the way that you ask questions. Any important question must be ongoing: a change in a relationship, a change in circumstances, a change in your work. Anything very consequential should be a question you live with if you want to hear the Inner Voice.</p>
<p>因为你不能与内识讨价还价，也不能做某种交易，所以你必须以一种非常诚实和开放的方式真正面对它。这将改变你与你自己的关系以及你提出问题的方式。任何重要的问题都必须是持续的：关系的变化、环境的变化、工作的变化。如果你想听到内心的声音，任何非常重要的事情都应该是你生命中要面对的问题。</p>
<p>Your question may be premature, or you may not be prepared to act regarding it. In either of these cases, you will not hear a real response. You will just hear what you tell yourself: your good ideas, your preferences, your fears and so forth, but you will not hear a real answer. So when you ask a question, formulate it correctly.</p>
<p>您的问题可能提出得太早，或者你还没有准备好采取行动。在这两种情况下，您都不会听到真正的回应。你只会听到你告诉你自己的话：你的好主意、你的偏好、你的恐惧等等，但你不会听到真正的答案。因此，当你提出问题时，请正确表述。</p>
<p>Then you must also ask: “Is it time for me to ask this question and am I really ready to hear the answer?” You see, because the answer is a directive to action, it is not something that you just think about. “Oh, I’ll think about this answer. I’m not sure about it. I&#96;ll think about it.”</p>
<p>接着，你还必须问：“现在我该问这个问题了吗？我真的准备好听答案了吗？”你看，答案是行动的指令，而不是你随便想想的事情。“哦，我会考虑一下这个答案。我不确定。我会考虑一下。”</p>
<p>No. If it is the Inner Voice, it is a directive. You follow or you do not. You do not bargain with it; you do not try to speculate about it; you do not intellectualize it. You either follow it or you do not because there is no conversation here. The Inner Voice is so much more powerful than your intellect. It is not going to bargain with you.</p>
<p>不。如果它是内心的声音，它就是一个指令。你要么听从，要么不听从。你不能与它讨价还价；你不能试图猜测它；你不能将它理性化。你要么听从，要么不听从，因为这里没有对话。内心的声音比你的智力强大得多。它不会和你讨价还价。</p>
<p>This is where your studenthood is very important. If you are not really studying The Way of Knowledge, you really are playing with something you do not understand, and you will not approach it correctly. And you will not in most cases hear the real answer. You will think that you are really listening within yourself, but you have not developed the depth and the skill and capacity yet. You think you are ready to know things, but often you are not ready to know those things.</p>
<p>这正是你的学生身份非常重要的地方。如果你没有真正学习内识之路，那么你实际上就是在玩弄一些你不理解的东西，你不会正确地对待它。而且在大多数情况下，你不会听到真正的答案。你会认为你真的在倾听你自己内心的声音，但你还没有发展出深度、技巧和能力。你会认为你已经准备好知道事情了，但通常你还没有准备好知道那些事情。</p>
<p>So you ask questions, but you are not sure you are ready to hear the real answer, and so you do not hear the real answer often. And if you do hear a real answer, it can create tremendous doubt and confusion within you because you are not really asking the question honestly, seeking not just an answer, but a direction.</p>
<p>因此，你问问题，但你不确定你是否准备好听到真正的答案，因此，你经常听不到真正的答案。如果你听到了真正的答案，它会让你内心产生巨大的怀疑和困惑，因为你并没有真正诚实地提出问题，你所寻求的不仅仅是答案，而是一种方向。</p>
<p>“Which way must I go?” Even here you ask: “Should I go here?” Yes or no. “Should I go there?” Yes or no. And you may have a feeling of yes or no; it does not even have to be the Voice yet. It all comes from Knowledge.</p>
<p>“我该往哪边走？”即使在这里你也会问：“我应该去这里吗？”是或否。“我应该去那里吗？”是或否。你可能有一种是或否的感觉；它甚至不必是声音。这一切都来自内识。</p>
<p>People have experiences of Knowledge but never take it any further. They get the feeling about something, and they do something or they do not do something as a result of this feeling, but they do not take it any further. “Where did that feeling come from? Maybe I should ask some other things about my life. If it is correct in this manner, maybe it could help guide me in other things that are more difficult.”</p>
<p>人们有过内识的体验，但从未进一步领悟。他们对某事有感觉，并根据这种感觉做某事或不做某事，但他们没有进一步领悟。“这种感觉从何而来？也许我应该问一些关于我生命的其他事情。如果这样是正确的，也许它可以帮助指导我处理其他更困难的事情。”</p>
<p>As you proceed as a student of the New Message, studying The Way of Knowledge, you will begin to see when you should ask questions. It happens when you are beginning to have an experience around something—a real deeper experience about something you are doing in life or need to do in life. That is when you ask the question, not before, not out of curiosity. The experience must proceed the question for the question to have the best option, the best possibility of leading you to the Inner Voice.</p>
<p>随着你作为新讯息的学生继续学习内识之路，你将开始看到何时应该提问。当你开始对某事有经验时，就会发生这种情况——对你在生命中正在做的事情或需要做的事情有真正更深层次的体验。这就是你提出问题的时候，而不是在之前，不是出于好奇。体验必须先于问题，这样问题才有最好的选择，才有最好的可能性引导你找到内在的声音。</p>
<p>This is all part of your preparation as a student of the New Message. You will learn here when it is time to ask a question and when it is not time. And what must precede this question to have it really be appropriate in that moment, and to have it really take you to a deeper experience of certainty within yourself.</p>
<p>这都是你作为新讯息学生的准备工作的一部分。在这里，你将学习何时该提问，何时不该提问。在提问之前必须先问什么，才能让提问在那一刻真正合适，才能真正让你自己在内心获得更深层次的确定性体验。</p>
<p>The experience of the Inner Voice can be very simple, very plain—no grandeur, no great altered states of consciousness. Just the Voice. Maybe it will say do this, or do not do that. Speak to this person, and so forth. There is nothing sensational, you see. There is no glory here. It is not a romance. The real experience of connection is so different from what many people think. They are expecting some great, powerful, overwhelming experience, and really what it is is just something that is just natural and there.</p>
<p>内在声音的体验可以非常简单、非常平淡——没有宏伟壮丽，没有伟大的意识状态改变。只有声音。也许它会说做这个，或者不要做那个。跟这个人说话，等等。你看，没有什么轰动性。在这里没有荣耀。它不是浪漫。真正的连接体验与许多人想象的完全不同。他们期待一些伟大、强大、压倒性的体验，而实际上它只是自然而然存在的事情。</p>
<p>The Inner Voice is so important if you can hear it, for it makes your life clear. It brings clarity to your situation. It brings purpose and direction to your situation. So even if you are suffering where you are due to your work or relationships or many things, the Inner Voice begins to simplify things and to give you an understanding. It also knows when to change and when not to change, how to change, where to change, what your change should look like and lead to.</p>
<p>如果你能听到内心的声音，它是如此的重要，因为它会让你的生命变得清晰。它让你的处境变得清晰。它为你的处境带来目的和方向。因此，即使你因为工作、人际关系或许多事情而遭受痛苦，内心的声音也会开始简化事情，让你理解。它还知道何时改变，何时不改变，如何改变，在哪里改变，你的改变应该是什么样的，会带来什么结果。</p>
<p>If you are not ready to act, you should not even know the truth because it will drive you crazy. You will say, “I know I must do this, but I can’t.” And you fall into conflict with yourself. And for most people, this leads to an avoidance of themselves. They do not want to ask questions anymore. They do not want to know things anymore. They do not want to have realization anymore because it is too conflicting for them. Perhaps they are stuck in a relationship. Perhaps they are stuck in a situation, and it should have changed a long time ago, but they are still there.</p>
<p>如果你还没有准备好采取行动，你甚至不应该知道真相，因为这会让你发疯。你会说，“我知道我必须这样做，但我做不到。”然后你就会陷入自我冲突。而对于大多数人来说，这会导致他们逃避他们自己。他们不想再问问题了。他们不想再知道事情了。他们不想再有认知，因为这对他们来说太矛盾了。也许他们被困在一段关系中。也许他们被困在一种情况中，这种情况早就应该改变了，但他们仍然在那里。</p>
<p>In such cases, the Inner Voice will just become silent and wait—wait until you are ready to know and wait until you are ready to take action that is beneficial. Therefore, wait for the experience. Wait for something to arise in your experience around some part of your life before you begin to question it: a discomfort, a sense of impending change, recognition of the truth about some aspect of your involvement. Then ask your question. And ask it in such a way that it leads to action.</p>
<p>在这种情况下，内心的声音会保持沉默并等待——等到你准备好知道并等到你准备好采取有益的行动。因此，等待体验。等待你生命中某些部分的经历中出现某些事情，然后再开始质疑它：一种不适感、一种即将发生的变化的感觉、对你参与的某些方面的真相的认识。然后提出你的问题。并以能够导致行动的方式提出问题。</p>
<p>Knowledge will also speak to you without speaking to you by giving you thoughts, feelings and sensations. Some people rarely ever hear the Inner Voice because they receive the guidance in other ways—through their feelings and emotions or through imagery and so forth. It is all the same communication experienced differently.</p>
<p>内识也会通过给你的思想、感觉和知觉来与你对话，而无需你开口。有些人很少听到内在声音，因为他们通过其他方式获得指导——通过他们的感受和情绪或通过想象等等。这些都是相同的交流，只是体验不同而已。</p>
<p>You are going to need this Inner Voice now because the Great Waves of change are coming to the world. The world is facing great disruption and upheaval. How will you know what to do in the face of this? This will change your circumstances. This will change what you must face, what you must consider, and the decisions you must make.</p>
<p>你现在需要这个内心的声音，因为变革的巨浪正在席卷世界。世界正面临巨大的混乱和动荡。面对这一切，你如何知道该怎么做？这将改变你的处境。这将改变你必须面对的事情、你必须考虑的事情以及你必须做出的决定。</p>
<p>Here you do not run away from life, but you go to meet it head on. This gives you a chance for success and to find your inner strength and to experience the power of Knowledge and the Inner Voice itself.</p>
<p>在这里，你不会逃避生命，而是勇敢面对生命。这给了你成功的机会，让你找到内心的力量，体验内识和内心声音的力量。</p>
<p>You must prepare for the Inner Voice to really hear it more consistently and to discern it from what you tell yourself and from the other voices in your mind that represent the forces of persuasion in your life. You must prepare and take the Steps to Knowledge. Learn how to quiet your mind. Learn how to ask real questions and when to ask them.</p>
<p>你必须为内在声音做好准备，以便更持续地真正聆听它，并从你告诉你自己的话语和你心灵中代表你生命中说服力的其他声音中辨别出它。你必须做好准备并开展内识进阶。学习如何让你的心灵平静下来。学习如何提出真正的问题以及何时提出这些问题。</p>
<p>There are many skills here. They are all important. They influence one another. These are not skills you learn in your schools or universities. They are skills that are fundamental to success in life and to protecting yourself from making grave and disastrous decisions.</p>
<p>这里有许多技能。它们都是重要的。它们相互影响。这些不是你在学校或大学可以学到的技能。这些技能是生命成功的基础，也是保护你自己不做出严重和灾难性决定的基础。</p>
<p>Any decision made with this power carries over to influence and inspire other people. It is the power and the presence of Knowledge resonating with others. Then you will know what you are doing right. You may not know what it will look like or even how it will take place, but you will know you are on the right track.</p>
<p>任何凭借这种力量做出的决定都会影响和激励他人。它是内识的力量和存在与他人产生的共鸣。然后你就会知道你正在做正确的事情。你可能不知道它会是什么样子，甚至不知道它会如何发生，但你会知道你正走在正确的轨道上。</p>
<p>We give this teaching in wisdom to you that you may further develop your skills as a student, and have a better opportunity to experience and express the power and the grace of Knowledge within yourself, and to hear it in others.</p>
<p>我们以智慧的方式向你传授这个教导，以便你能够进一步发展作为学生的技能，并有一个更好的机会体验和表达你自己内在内识的力量和恩典，并在他人身上听到它。</p>
<p>Let this be your understanding.</p>
<p>让这成为你的理解。</p>
