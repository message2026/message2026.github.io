<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on February 17, 2009 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2009 年 2 月 17 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very tragic that people are so unaware of what is happening around them, so preoccupied they are with their own thoughts, problems and concerns. It is a remarkable thing that the most intelligent creature should be functioning in such an unintelligent manner. For the animals in the field and the birds in the air are always watching their environment, always checking to see where things stand. Of course, they must do this to survive. But for humanity, so long sheltered in the wealthy nations from the vicissitudes of life and so reliant upon authority figures to define reality and to provide insulation, much of this natural ability and acuity has been lost.</p>
<p>人类对周围发生的事情如此漠不关心，只顾着他们自身的思想、问题和担忧，这是非常可悲的。最聪慧的生灵竟然以如此愚蠢的方式运作，这真是太不可思议了。因为田野里的动物和空中的鸟儿总是在观察周围的环境，总是在查看事情的进展情况。当然，它们必须这样做才能生存。但是，对于人类来说，由于长期生活在富裕的国家里，躲避着生命的沧桑巨变，依赖于权威人士来定义现实和提供保护，这种自然的能力和敏锐性已经丧失殆尽。</p>
<p>This is not living in fear. This is simply being aware—aware of your environment; aware of what is going on around you; aware of the thoughts, feelings and attitudes of the people you associate with or whom you work with; a careful discernment, an objective discernment, of what is happening around you.</p>
<p>这不是生活在恐惧之中。这只是察觉到——察觉到你的环境；察觉到你周围发生的事情；察觉到与你交往的人或与你一起工作的人的思想、感受和态度；仔细辨别、客观地辨别你周围发生的事情。</p>
<p>This discernment is very important because it gives you a forewarning of future problems. It tells you who in your environment is trustworthy and who in your environment is aware themselves. You become aware of the dynamics between people who work together. And most importantly, you are able to respond to Knowledge within yourself as you perceive the world around you.</p>
<p>这种辨别力非常重要，因为它能为你提供未来问题的预警。它告诉你在你所处的环境中，谁是值得信赖的，谁是有自知之明的。你会察觉到一起工作的人之间的动态关系。最重要的是，当你感知周围的世界时，你能够对你内在的内识做出回应。</p>
<p>This requires a clarity of mind, a state where you are not constantly dreaming and wondering and hoping and problem solving in your own mind. You are very present to the situations you are in. You are very present to the people you are with. You are discerning the environment.</p>
<p>这需要心灵的清晰，在这种状态下，你不会不断地做梦、猜测、希望，也不会在你自身的心灵中解决问题。你对你所处的环境非常在场。你非常关注与你在一起的人。你正在辨别环境。</p>
<p>This is especially important for people because the mental environment in which you live, the environment of thought and influence, is complex and has great impact upon people emotionally, and carries with it great consequences in the kind of experience that people have in their lives.</p>
<p>这对于人们来说尤其重要，因为你生活的心理环境，思想的环境和影响的环境是复杂的，对人们的情绪有着巨大冲击，并且对人们的生命体验产生重大影响。</p>
<p>Here part of your spiritual practice is to cultivate a watchtower, where you look at the world around you and you look at your circumstances with great objectivity—discerning any problems before they arise, discerning hazards before they come upon you, discerning the nature and intentions of people around you and whether any of them have yet discovered the power and the presence of Knowledge within themselves. This is an antidote to self-obsession and really to obsession of any kind because you cannot be paying attention to your own inner experience and the world around you and be obsessed with other things.</p>
<p>在这里，你精神练习的一部分是培育一座瞭望塔，在瞭望塔中，你以极大的客观性来审视你周遭的世界和你的境况——在任何问题出现之前辨别它们，在危险降临到你头上之前辨别它们，辨别你周遭人们的自然和意图，以及他们中是否有人已经发现了他们内在内识的力量和存在。这是对自我痴迷的一剂解药，实际上是对任何一种痴迷的一剂解药，因为你不可能一边关注你自己的内在体验和你周遭的世界，一边痴迷于其他事物。</p>
<p>Here going up in your watchtower to look at the horizon of the world; to look at your immediate circumstances; to be watchful for hazards or problems and opportunities as they arise is not something you just do once in a while. It is actually part of your spiritual practice, something around which you develop a set of skills.</p>
<p>在这里，登上你的瞭望塔，眺望世界的地平线；观察你当前的情况；警惕出现的危险、问题和机会，这并不是你偶尔才会做的事情。它实际上是你精神练习的一部分，是你发展一系列技能的一部分。</p>
<p>Here you practice stilling your mind to be observant. Here instead of immediately judging the world or reacting to situations around you, you begin to discern them more objectively. You check your own reactions and impulses so that you may become aware.</p>
<p>在这里，你练习静止你的心灵来进行观察。在这里，你不会立即评判世界或对周围的情况做出反应，而是开始更客观地辨别它们。你检查你自身的反应和冲动，从而变得警觉。</p>
<p>This is especially important now because humanity is entering times where the insulation for people in the wealthy nations, or anyone who could afford such things in the past, will have to now face a more turbulent and difficult world—a world of declining resources, a world of greater competition between nations, a world that will have many stresses and challenges. You cannot be lost in your romances and your fantasies and your dreams and be able to make it in a world like this. So the watchtower becomes ever more important for you now.</p>
<p>现在这一点尤为重要，因为人类正在进入这样一个时代：富裕国家人民的隔离，或者过去任何能负担得起这种东西的人，现在都必须面对一个更加动荡和艰难的世界——一个资源日益减少的世界，一个国家间竞争更加激烈的世界，一个将面临许多压力和挑战的世界。你不能迷失在你的浪漫、你的幻想和你的梦想中，而要在这样的一个世界里生存下去。因此，瞭望塔现在对你来说变得比以往任何时候都更加重要。</p>
<p>Great Waves of change are coming to the world—all converging at this time, creating a set of currents and cross-currents that are so complex and interactive that it will be nearly impossible for anyone to discern how things are going to play out. These Waves are very powerful. They can deprive you of your employment. They can deprive you of your wealth. They can deprive you of your opportunities. And, in extreme cases, they can even deprive you of your life.</p>
<p>变革的巨浪正在席卷世界——所有这些都在此时汇聚，形成一系列如此复杂且相互作用的潮流和逆潮流，几乎任何人都不可能辨别事情将如何展开。这些巨浪非常强大。它们可以剥夺你的工作。它们可以剥夺你的财富。它们可以剥夺你的机会。并且在极端情况下，它们甚至可能夺走你的生命。</p>
<p>To be unaware of them, and to not pay attention to them, is clearly foolish and unintelligent. To simply complain about the way things are or condemn people who you think are responsible for the difficulties of the world is really not to be present. It is not a state of awareness. It is not a state of clear observation. To avoid the world, to deny what is happening around you, to protect yourself or to try to keep your fantasies and preoccupations alive, is clearly unintelligent and self-destructive.</p>
<p>不去察觉它们，不去关注它们，显然是愚蠢和不明智的。只是抱怨现状或谴责那些你认为应该为世界困难负责的人，其实并不是活在当下。它不是一种觉知的状态。它不是一种清晰观察的状态。逃避世界，否认周围发生的事情，保护你自己或试图保持幻想和专注，显然是不明智的，是自我毁灭的。</p>
<p>How many people are caught off guard by situations they were not anticipating and for which they were unprepared? Look in the world around you and you will see how people are suddenly overtaken by changes in their economic life, by changes in the climate, by changes in the social or political makeup of the world in which they live.</p>
<p>有多少人因为没有预料到、毫无准备的情况弄得措手不及？环顾你周围的世界，你会看到人们的生命如何突然被他们经济中的变化、气候变化、以及他们生活的世界中社会或政治结构的变化所左右。</p>
<p>If you are not watching, then life will carry on, and it will overtake you. And because you are unprepared for it and did not anticipate it, it will have a great and often devastating impact upon you.</p>
<p>如果你不注意，生命就会继续，它会超越你。由于你没有做好准备，没有预料到，它会对你产生巨大且往往是毁灭性的影响。</p>
<p>The Creator of all life has given you a greater Intelligence, the power and the presence of Knowledge within yourself—a Mind beneath the mind that you think with, a Mind that is wise and powerful, a Mind that is not corrupted by the world. This Mind is here to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to your greater accomplishments and relationships in life.</p>
<p>所有生命的创造者赋予了你一个更伟大的智能，你内在内识的力量和存在——一个在你思考心灵之下的心灵，一个明智而强大的心灵，一个不被世界所腐蚀的心灵。这个心灵在此指引你，保护你，引领你走向生命中更伟大的成就和关系。</p>
<p>Knowledge will exert itself in these ways, and you will feel its impact and its guidance, its encouragements and its restraints, if you are really present to your own inner experience. But if you are not present, if you are preoccupied, if you are busy all the time, running around like a crazy person, if you are driven by the needs and expectations of others or by your own insecurity, you will not hear and experience the expressions of Knowledge within yourself or even within other people.</p>
<p>内识将以这些方式发挥它自己的作用，如果你真正在场于你自身的内在体验，你将感受到它的冲击和它的指引、它的鼓励和它的约束。但是，如果你不在场，如果你心不在焉，如果你总是忙碌，像个疯子一样四处奔波，如果你被他人的需求和期望或你自身的不安全感所驱使，你将无法听到和体验到你内在甚至他人内在的内识表达。</p>
<p>In a social setting, someone may have a moment of prescience where they see something important and they report it to their friends or acquaintances, and nobody really wants to hear it. Nobody wants to deal with it. People repudiate it. They deny it, or they just avoid it altogether. Here you can see in so many circumstances how the deeper Intelligence that every individual possesses is thwarted by social attitudes and by the general state of mind of people around them.</p>
<p>在社交场合，有人可能会有预感，他们看到了一些重要的事情，并向朋友或熟人报告，但没有人真正想听。没有人愿意处理它。人们拒绝它。他们否认它，或者干脆完全回避它。在这里，你可以在许多情况下看到，每个人所拥有的更深层次的智能是如何受到社会态度和周围人的普遍心灵状态阻碍的。</p>
<p>Here people do not want to talk about certain things. They do not want to think about certain things. They are so afraid of themselves and their own experience, and they are so afraid of the world that they want to live in a little world of their own creation, indulging in their own thoughts, hopes and fears. They want to live this little life—undisturbed by the world, unfettered by the world and uninterrupted by life. This is so clearly unintelligent and self-destructive because you are part of life. You were sent into the world to participate in life. And Knowledge within you is here to guide you to become aware of your own experience and of the world around you very profoundly.</p>
<p>在这里，人们不想谈论某些事情。他们不想思考某些事情。他们如此害怕他们自己和他们自身的体验，他们如此害怕世界，以至于他们想生活在他们自身创造的一个小世界里，沉溺于他们自身的思想、希望和恐惧中。他们想过这种小生命——不受世界干扰，不受世界束缚，不受生命的干扰。这显然是不明智的和自我毁灭的，因为你是生命的一部分。你被派到世界上来参与生命。你内在的内识在此引导你深刻地察觉你自身的体验和你周围的世界。</p>
<p>So clearly here people’s self-denial and the reality of Knowledge within them are in great contrast to one another and are moving in extremely different directions. Here it is so very important to snap out of your dreams, to recognize the degree to which you are unaware of your environment, of people and of your own deeper experience and to see that really what spiritual practice is, is reconnecting with the power of Knowledge within yourself and reconnecting with the world around you.</p>
<p>因此，很明显，人们的自我否定和他们内在内识的现实形成了巨大的对比，并且朝着截然不同的方向发展。在这里，从你的梦中醒来，认识到你对环境、对人和你自身的更深层次体验的无知程度，并认识到精神练习的实际意义，就是重新与你内在内识的力量建立联系，重新与你周围的世界建立联系，这些都是非常重要的。</p>
<p>But you cannot do either of these things if your mind is full of condemnation—full of self-condemnation and condemnation of others. Clearly, you cannot do this if you are simply ascribing to one idea or one perspective or relying upon your judgments against other people and your prejudicial thinking. For with this, you cannot look, you cannot listen, you cannot hear, you cannot explore, and you cannot penetrate the surface of life, for you are just reacting to it automatically and mindlessly.</p>
<p>但如果你的心灵充满谴责——充满自我谴责和对他人的谴责——你就无法做到这两件事。显然，如果你只是简单地归因于一个想法或一个观点，或者依靠你对他人的判断和你的偏见思维，你就无法做到这一点。因为这样，你无法观察，你无法倾听，你无法去听，你无法探索，你无法穿透生命的表面，因为你只是在自动地、盲目地对它做出反应。</p>
<p>Paying attention to your environment, paying attention to your interactions with other people and listening for Knowledge within yourself as you do so represents the state of mind and the neutrality that you really want to have. Because it is through this neutrality that you can begin to really see what is happening, and you can discern who to be with and who not to be with; where to go, where not to go; what to do, what not to do. You can discern your actions and behaviors that are in keeping with your deeper nature and those actions and behaviors that undermine or that go against your deeper nature.</p>
<p>关注你的环境，关注你与他人的互动，并在这样做的同时聆听你内在的内识，这代表着你真正想要拥有的心灵状态和中立。因为正是通过这种中立，你才能够开始真正看到正在发生的事情，你能够辨别该和谁在一起，不该和谁在一起；该去哪里，不该去哪里；该做什么，不该做什么。你可以辨别那些符合你更深层次自然的行动和行为，以及那些破坏或违背你更深层次自然的行动和行为。</p>
<p>With this clarity of mind, you can see what is coming over the horizon, and Knowledge within you will teach you how to prepare for eventualities. You will not be suddenly overtaken by dramatic loss or dramatic change. For before anything significant happens, there are signs, and you will see these signs and respond to them wisely rather than denying them or forgetting them or repudiating them.</p>
<p>凭借这种心灵的明晰，你能够看到地平线上正在发生的事情，你内在的内识将教你如何为可能发生的情况做好准备。你不会突然被巨大的损失或巨大的变化所压倒。因为在任何重大事件发生之前，都会有迹象，你将看到这些迹象并明智地应对它们，而不是否认它们、忘记它们或拒绝它们。</p>
<p>So the watchtower is a spiritual practice, something you learn to do. You sit quietly and watch the world without judgment, without conclusions. You sit quietly and watch others without judgment and without conclusions, trying to feel the mental environment, listening for Knowledge as you do so.</p>
<p>因此，瞭望塔是一种精神练习，是你学会去做的事情。你静静地坐着，不带任何评判、不带任何结论地观察这个世界。你静静地坐着，不带任何评判、不带任何结论地观察他人，努力感受心理环境，同时倾听内识的声音。</p>
<p>Here you listen to others. Instead of being caught up in your conversation, you listen to hear and to experience their deeper nature and their true condition at this moment. Here you are not judging them. Instead, you are discerning them. You are present to them. And if this is carried out correctly, you will learn a great deal about them in a short time. You will also feel compassion towards them, and you will understand them, and you will not deny their humanity.</p>
<p>在这里，你聆听他人。你不会陷入你的谈话中，而是聆听并体验他们此刻更深层次的自然和真实状况。在这里，你不会评判他们。相反，你辨别他们。你与他们同在。如果正确地做到这一点，你将在短时间内学到很多关于他们的事情。你还将对他们感到同情，你将理解他们，你将不会否认他们的人性。</p>
<p>If people would listen to each other, really, without simply reacting, you would have far less misunderstanding, far less violence and far less conflict in the world today. So this is a fundamental skill. You must see beyond your judgments and your reactions. You must gain a greater control over your mind, or you will not be able to see, hear and know the truth about anything.</p>
<p>如果人们能够真正地倾听彼此，而不是简单地做出反应，那么当今世界的误解、暴力和冲突就会大大减少。因此，这是一项基本技能。你必须超越你的判断和你的反应。你必须更好地控制你的心灵，否则你将无法看到、听到和知道任何事物的真理。</p>
<p>One of the great truths that you must begin to consider is that who you are is not your mind. Who you are is not your thoughts and your beliefs and the parade of fantasies and ideas that constantly cross your mind. This is just the mind reflecting all the things it absorbs from the world around it and its own judgments, its own blind decisions, its own prejudices, its fears, its fantasies and its desires.</p>
<p>你必须开始考虑的一个伟大真理是，你是谁并不取决于你的心灵。你是谁并不取决于你的思想、你的信仰以及你心灵中不断浮现的幻想和想法。这只是心灵对它从周围世界吸收的所有事物的反映，以及它自身的判断、它自身的盲目决定、它自身的偏见、它的恐惧、它的幻想和它的欲望。</p>
<p>In practicing stillness in the study of Steps to Knowledge, you learn to see how much your thoughts really do not reflect your deeper nature, how much you are influenced by the opinions of others, how irrational your thinking really is, how disconnected your thoughts really are, how opinionated you are, how unresponsive to your environment you are and that you are missing so many clues and signs from the world around you because your mind is preoccupied and is not present.</p>
<p>在研究内识进阶的过程中练习静止时，你会学会看到，你的思想在多大程度上并没有反映出你更深层次的自然，你在多大程度上受到他人观点的影响，你的思维到底有多么不合理，你的思想是多么脱节，你是多么固执己见，你对周围环境有多么不敏感，而且你错过了来自周围世界的许多线索和迹象，因为你的心灵是心事重重的，心不在焉的。</p>
<p>Here you discover that you are missing the greatest things in life. You are missing the experience of affinity with others. You are missing the appreciation of beauty in your environment. You are missing the experience of gratitude for all the things that you have and all the things that are working for you at this moment. You are missing connections with people. You are missing opportunities. You are missing the signs of danger or hazard.</p>
<p>在这里你会发现你正在错过生命中最伟大的事情。你正在错过与他人的亲和力体验。你正在错过对周围环境之美的欣赏。你正在错过对你拥有的一切以及此刻为你工作的一切的感激之情。你正在错过与人的联接。你正在错过机会。你正在错过危险或危害的迹象。</p>
<p>There is a watchtower there within you, but no one is there. It is empty. There is no one to guard the gates of your mind and your heart. The Great Waves are coming, but there is no one to observe them, to consider them and to prepare for them.</p>
<p>你的内心有一座瞭望塔，但那里空无一人。它是空的。没有人守卫你的心灵和你的内心。巨浪即将来临，但没有人观察它们、考虑它们并为它们做好准备。</p>
<p>This is really coming to terms with your own experience and your own lack of response, or responsibility, to the world around you. Responsibility is the ability to respond, and this response must not be to final events as much as to everything that leads up to them.</p>
<p>这实际上是在接受你自身的体验，以及你自身对周围世界缺乏回应或责任的事实。责任就是回应的能力，而这种回应不能是对最终事件的回应，也不能是对导致事件发生的一切的回应。</p>
<p>You do not just find out one day that you happen to be married to the wrong person. You do not just find out one day that your work and career does not really represent who you are and what you are here to do. You do not merely wake up one day and find that economic change has depleted you and put you in a position of impoverishment. You do not just wake up one day to find that your body is ill. You do not just wake up one day to find yourself abandoned by someone whom you thought was really there for you.</p>
<p>你不会在某一天突然发现你嫁错了人。你不会在某一天突然发现你的工作和事业并不真正代表你是谁以及你来这里是为了什么。你不会在某一天醒来发现经济变化耗尽了你的精力并让你陷入贫困。你不会在某一天醒来发现你的身体生病了。你不会在某一天醒来发现你自己被一个你认为会真正陪伴你的人抛弃了。</p>
<p>Where were you leading up to all these events? Where were you when all the signs of these events and eventualities were being shown to you? Where was your mind? Where was your attention? What were you doing to not see and not respond to all the indicators that were showing you what was coming—warning you, alerting you, preparing you and so forth?</p>
<p>在所有这些事件发生之前，你在哪里？当所有这些事件和可能性的迹象都向你展现时，你在哪里？你的心灵在哪里？你的注意力在哪里？你做了什么，以至于没有看到和回应所有向你展示即将发生的事情的迹象——警告你、提醒你、让你做好准备等等？</p>
<p>People love to complain about the way things are and cast blame all around, but where are they in responding to the world? Can they see opportunity in adversity? Can they see adversity in opportunity? Are they really watching? Are they paying attention? Are they responding to Knowledge within themselves? Or are they merely obsessed and preoccupied, unaware of what is happening within them and around them, not really participating in life, not really present for others, sort of living in their own little nightmarish world, hoping that life around them will not impinge upon their obsessions?</p>
<p>人们喜欢抱怨现状并四处指责，但是他们如何回应世界呢？他们能在逆境中看到机会吗？他们能在机会中看到逆境吗？他们真的在观察吗？他们在关注吗？他们在回应他们内在的内识吗？或者他们只是痴迷和心不在焉，没有察觉到他们内在和周围正在发生的事情，没有真正参与生命，没有真正为他人而存在，生活在他们自身的小小的噩梦般的世界里，希望他们周围的生命不会侵犯他们的痴迷？</p>
<p>This is the sad state of so many people, and everyone suffers from this to a certain degree. It is kind of a social amnesia, where people literally forget who they are, what they are, where they are going and what they are doing. They are not paying attention, or they are only paying attention to one or two things to the negligence of everything else.</p>
<p>这是许多人的悲哀状态，每个人都在一定程度上遭受这种状态的影响。这是一种社交失忆症，人们完全忘记了他们是谁、他们是什么、他们要去哪里以及他们在做什么。他们没有注意，或者只注意一两件事而忽略了其他一切。</p>
<p>If you were really paying attention to your own deeper experience and to what is happening in your environment, you would not have time to suffer. You would have far less time for this. And it would become ever more difficult for you to make a serious mistake, for you would see the signs and the indicators that you are on the wrong track, or that something was going to change that would affect you and the outcome of your life.</p>
<p>如果你真正关注你自身更深层次的体验以及你的环境中正在发生的事情，你就没有时间去受苦。你会有更少的时间去受苦。你将更难犯下严重的错误，因为你将看到那些迹象和指标，表明你走在错误的道路上，或者某些事情将要发生改变，影响你和你的生命结果。</p>
<p>This is a very fundamental part of your spiritual practice. Spiritual practice is not to transcend the world or to cavort with angels or to experience unlimited bliss. Spiritual practice is really about becoming re-engaged with Knowledge within yourself, the deeper Intelligence within yourself, and to become truly engaged with the world around you and with other people. Here spiritual practice is not a form of escape. It is not a personal obsession. It is the road back to real engagement with yourself and the world. It is the road out of Separation. It is the road out of isolation. It is moving your life in a true direction. It is building the necessary awareness and skills. It is developing new habits of thinking and observation. And it is giving you the strength to overcome your past tendencies, many of which you have simply adopted from the culture around you.</p>
<p>这是你精神练习的一个非常基本的部分。精神练习不是为了超越世界，不是为了与天使嬉戏，不是为了体验无限的幸福。精神练习实际上是重新与你内在的内识、你内在更深层次的智能接触，并真正地与你周围的世界和其他人接触。在这里，精神练习不是一种逃避。它不是一种个人痴迷。它是回归与你自己和世界的真正接触的道路。它是走出分离的道路。它是走出孤立的道路。它让你的生命朝着真正的方向发展。它建立必要的觉知和技能。它培养新的思维和观察习惯。它给你力量去克服你过去的倾向，其中许多是你从你周围的文化中吸收来的。</p>
<p>You can practice being in the watchtower in so many situations:</p>
<p>你可以在许多情况下练习身处瞭望塔：</p>
<p>Waiting for a bus, sitting there, being present to the world.</p>
<p>等公交车时，坐在那里，面对世界。</p>
<p>In any roomful of people, checking the mental environment.</p>
<p>在任何满是人的房间里，审视心理环境。</p>
<p>In any conversation, listening carefully to others while you are listening for Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>在任何对话中，仔细聆听他人，同时也在聆听你内在的内识。</p>
<p>Receiving news from the world and really considering what this means.</p>
<p>接收来自世界的新闻，并真正思考这意味着什么。</p>
<p>Watching certain key indicators in the world in the face of the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>面对变革的巨浪，观察世界上的某些关键指标。</p>
<p>Watching the price and availability of food.</p>
<p>观察食物的价格和可用性。</p>
<p>Watching the availability of water and the problem of drought.</p>
<p>观察水的可用性和干旱问题。</p>
<p>Watching the indicators of a change in climate and a warming world.</p>
<p>气候变化和全球变暖的指标。</p>
<p>Watching the economy to see how stable or unstable it really is.</p>
<p>观察经济，看看它到底有多稳定或多不稳定。</p>
<p>Watching the weather and the changing circumstances of your life.</p>
<p>观察天气和你生命不断变化的境遇。</p>
<p>Watching the actions of other people to learn from their successes and mistakes.</p>
<p>观察其他人的行为，从他们的成功和错误中学习。</p>
<p>To be present to the beauty of life around you, to the marvel of your existence and to the innumerable things in your life that are supporting you and that are beneficial for you.</p>
<p>在场你周围生命的美好，在场你存在的奇迹，在场你生命中支持你、对你有益的无数事物。</p>
<p>How can you be immersed in depression or suffering when you are paying so much attention to all these things, when you are exercising observation and clarity of mind? Clearly, you have gained enough strength here to check your own self-destructive tendencies, to check your own desire for denial and avoidance, to choose again how you will respond to the world, instead of being merely a slave to your reactions and to your previous thinking and social conditioning.</p>
<p>当你如此关注所有这些事情，当你锻炼观察力和心灵清晰时，你怎么会陷入沮丧或痛苦之中呢？显然，你在这里获得了足够的力量来检查你自身的自我毁灭倾向，检查你自身的否认和逃避的欲望，重新选择你将如何回应这个世界，而不是仅仅成为你的反应、你以前的思维和社会条件的奴隶。</p>
<p>This being present requires looking and listening and observing—without judgment, without preference, without trying to make things look the way you want them to look, without trying to simply focus on one aspect of life alone, without avoiding anything and without denying anything. Just being present.</p>
<p>这种在场需要去看、倾听和观察——不带任何评判、不带任何偏好、不试图让事物按照你想要的方式呈现、不试图只关注生命的某一方面、不回避任何事情、不否认任何事情。只是在场。</p>
<p>To love another, you must be present to them. To love the world, you must be present to the world. To love and to know yourself, you must be present to yourself.</p>
<p>要爱另一个人，你必须在场于他们。要爱世界，你必须在场于世界。要爱你自己、知道你自己，你必须在场你自己。</p>
<p>The more that you gain this awareness and this set of skills, the more you see that people around you seem like they are sleeping. They are moving about with their eyes open, but they are not really present to the world or to themselves. They seem greatly unresponsive to all the signs the world is providing. They seem to be really unaware of their own situation and the great price they are paying for so many things that do not support them.</p>
<p>你越是获得这种觉知和这一系列技能，你就越会看到你周围的人似乎在睡觉。他们睁着眼睛四处走动，但他们并没有真正面对世界或面对他们自己。他们似乎对世界提供的所有迹象都反应迟钝。他们似乎真的没有察觉到他们自身的处境，也没有察觉到他们为许多不支持他们的事情付出了多大的代价。</p>
<p>Rich or poor, you see this in people. Here beauty, wealth and charm are seen as not a real advantage unless a person is really present and clear minded and connected to Knowledge within themselves. Here all the advantages that people are struggling to have and to defend now seem to have much less value, if they have any value at all.</p>
<p>无论贫富，你都能在人们身上看到这一点。在这里，美貌、财富和魅力不被视为真正的优势，除非一个人真正在场、心灵清晰并与内在的内识相连。在这里，人们努力争取和捍卫的所有优势现在似乎都价值大打折扣，如果它们还有任何价值的话。</p>
<p>For if you are missing all of life’s beauty, all of life’s indicators, all of life’s signs, all of life’s opportunities, what is the value of beauty, wealth and charm? If these things are replacing your ability to truly unite with another person, or to respond to the power and the presence of Knowledge within yourself, what value do these things have at all? And yet people are mesmerized by them. They are spending their whole life trying to acquire these things, trying to prove things to themselves, trying to fulfill their ideas and their fantasies, trying to gain the acceptance of some other person whom they admire.</p>
<p>因为如果你失去了生命中所有的美丽、生命中所有的指标、生命中所有的迹象、生命中所有的机会，那么美丽、财富和魅力又有什么价值呢？如果这些东西取代了你与他人真正结合的能力，或者取代了你对你自己内心内识的力量和存在作出回应的能力，那么这些东西还有什么价值呢？然而，人们却被这些东西迷住了。他们终其一生都在试图获得这些东西，试图向他们自己证明一些事情，试图满足他们的想法和他们幻想，试图获得他们所崇拜的其他人的认可。</p>
<p>One of the practices in Steps to Knowledge—at the very beginning of the study of Steps to Knowledge—poses the fundamental question, the fundamental problem in human awareness. It states: “Knowledge is with me, but where am I? Knowledge is with me, but where am I?” Knowledge is alive, fully present within you, but you are not experiencing it. So where are you? Life is happening all around you, but if you are not experiencing it, where are you? People are communicating to you on all different kinds of levels, but if you cannot hear them, then where is your mind? Where is your focus? Where is your awareness?</p>
<p>《内识进阶》中的一项练习——在《内识进阶》学习的开端——提出了根本问题，即人类觉知中的根本问题。它指出：“内识与我同在，但我在哪里？内识与我同在，但我在哪里？”内识是活生生的，完全存在于你的内在，但你却没有体验到它。那么你在哪里？生命就在你周围发生，但如果你没有体验到它，那你在哪里？人们在各种不同层面上与你交流，但如果你听不到他们，那么你的心灵在哪里？你的焦点在哪里？你的觉知在哪里？</p>
<p>If you cannot be present to life or to others or to yourself, the only possible place you could be is to be lost somewhere in your own thoughts, hidden behind your own self-defenses, covered up by your suppressed feelings and emotions, buried in your reactions to the past. Essentially, if you cannot be present to yourself, to others or to life, it means you are caught up in your thoughts and in your own condition.</p>
<p>如果你不能在生命中在场，或在场于他人或者你自己，那么你唯一可能的位置就是迷失在你自身的思想中，隐藏在你自身的自我防御背后，被压抑的感情和情绪所掩盖，埋藏在对过去的反应中。从根本上说，如果你不能在场于你自己、他人或生命中，就意味着你陷入了你的思想和你自身的状况中。</p>
<p>Here it is really necessary to break free. It is really necessary to begin to explore your own feelings. If you cannot feel anger, then you will not feel love. If you cannot feel sadness, how can you experience affinity with anyone? If you are choked because of the suppression of these things, then your mind will be unclear, your senses will be dulled and your expression will be oppressed.</p>
<p>在这里，你真的需要挣脱束缚。你真的有必要开始探索你自身的感受。如果你不能感受到愤怒，那么你就不会感受到爱。如果你不能感受到悲伤，你又怎么能体验到与他人的亲和力呢？如果你因为这些东西的压抑而窒息，那么你的心灵就会变得模糊，你的感官就会变得迟钝，你的表达就会受到压制。</p>
<p>In becoming aware of your own experience, you begin to have this experience, and some of it is simply residue from the past—old regrets, failed love, inability to communicate, failed expectations, disappointment, upsets with people, problems with people—just residue from the past that is choking you, filling up your mind, backing up your mind.</p>
<p>当你察觉到你自身的体验时，你就会开始有这种体验，而其中一些只是过去的残留——旧时的遗憾、失败的爱情、无法沟通、落空的期望、失望、与人的不和、与人之间的问题——只是过去的残留，让你窒息，填满你的心灵，并支持你的心灵。</p>
<p>In the study of Steps to Knowledge, these things begin now to flow into your awareness. You are not suppressing them any more. Perhaps it is a matter of just experiencing all these things so that you are not so afraid of them, and you are not running away from them anymore. Perhaps there are people you must communicate with to try to resolve old misunderstandings. Perhaps the love you could not express or experience with your family or parents needs now to be examined so that you understand the situation more clearly and more objectively.</p>
<p>在内识进阶的研究中，这些事情现在开始流入你的觉知。你不再压抑它们。也许这只是一个经历所有这些事情的问题，这样你就不会那么害怕它们，你也不再逃避它们。也许你必须与某些人沟通，以试图解决旧有的误解。也许你无法与家人或父母表达或体验到的爱现在需要被审视，这样你才能更清楚、更客观地理解情况。</p>
<p>This is part of the reconciliation that must happen, part of the cleaning and clearing of old and negative emotions, part of the restoration of your mind. What was oppressing you before is now being replaced by the ability to discern your experience and to determine how you want to communicate with people. Before, you were too oppressed to have this freedom of choice, but now you are able to exercise it more freely. Self-trust now returns to you. The appreciation for your life, even for your mistakes, now returns to you, as you are able to gain a greater value and wisdom from these experiences. Instead of running away from yourself or avoiding yourself, you are opening the doors to your inner world, letting all the demons out, letting all the darkness out, turning on the lights in the dark recesses of your mind.</p>
<p>这是必须发生的和解的一部分，是清理和清除旧有负面情绪的一部分，是恢复你心灵的一部分。以前压迫你的一切，现在被辨别你的经验和决定你想如何与人交流的能力所取代。以前，你被压迫得太厉害，没有这种选择的自由，但现在你可以更自由地行使它了。自我信任现在又回到了你身上。你现在又开始珍惜你的生命，甚至珍惜你的错误，因为你能够从这些经历中获得更大的价值和智慧。你不是逃避你自己或躲避你自己，而是打开内心世界的大门，让所有的恶魔都出来，让所有的黑暗都出来，点亮你心灵黑暗角落里的灯。</p>
<p>Here you are not running around, filling up every moment with stimulation and activities. Even in the name of practical needs, you are not doing this. You are creating enough time and space in your life to begin to re-evaluate your own experience, to re-evaluate your circumstances, to re-evaluate your engagements with others and your relationships, to re-evaluate your own tendencies and to re-evaluate your strengths and your weaknesses and those attitudes that you might still have that really are working against you. Here you have the opportunity to become more objective about your social conditioning and what part of that conditioning you want to maintain and what part you want to change or eliminate.</p>
<p>在这里，你不再四处奔波，不再用刺激和活动填满每一刻。即使以实际需要的名义，你也没有这样做。你在你的生命中创造了足够的时间和空间来开始重新评估你自身的经历，重新评估你的境遇，重新评估你与他人的交往和你的关系，重新评估你自身的倾向，重新评估你的优势和弱点，以及那些你可能仍然拥有的、对你不利的态度。在这里，你有机会更加客观地看待你的社会条件，以及你想维持这种条件的哪一部分，你想改变或消除哪一部分。</p>
<p>But you cannot do any of these things if you are running around all the time, with the television blaring and the radio blaring and your mind chattering away mindlessly, endlessly, talking about things of little or no consequence. You cannot do these things if your mind is obsessed over some interest or hobby. You cannot do these things if you cannot face your current condition, which for so many people is far more detrimental than they are willing to admit.</p>
<p>但是，如果你总是四处奔波，电视机声、收音机声此起彼伏，你的心灵无意识地、没完没了地喋喋不休地谈论着一些无关紧要的事情，你就不可能做这些事情。如果你的心灵沉迷于某种兴趣或爱好，你就无法做到这些事情。如果你无法面对你目前的状况，你就无法做这些事情，而对许多人来说，这种状况的危害性远远超过了他们愿意承认的程度。</p>
<p>All this comes from watching, looking and listening: the Watchtower. The Watchtower: looking within yourself and scanning your inner world. The Watchtower: looking to the outside and scanning your environment and discerning what is coming over the horizon. Over time, as you develop this awareness, this emphasis and these skills, your mind will become the wonderful vehicle of communication that it really is. You will see that who you are is beyond the mind, beyond the reach and the realm of the intellect, something that cannot be defined easily or put into a simple definition. And you will see that your life is full of mystery and full of wonder.</p>
<p>所有这些都来自于观察、审视和聆听：瞭望塔。瞭望塔：审视你自己，审视你的内心世界。瞭望塔：观察外部，审视你的环境，辨别地平线上即将发生的事情。随着时间的推移，随着你培养这种觉知、这种专注和这些技能，你的心灵将成为真正美妙的沟通工具。你会看到，你是谁超越了心灵，超越了智力的范围和领域，无法轻易定义或用简单的定义来表达。你会看到你的生命充满了神秘和奇迹。</p>
<p>Here you will learn to be grateful even for your mistakes, for they will teach you and give you the gifts of wisdom. Here you will look at other people’s mistakes, which heretofore you used to condemn and react to. Now you are looking at these with a different awareness, to see how they are teaching you about wisdom and showing you the consequences of living without Knowledge or trying to live out your fantasies and your pursuits without clarity and awareness.</p>
<p>在这里，你将学会感激你的错误，因为它们会教导你，并给予你智慧的礼物。在这里，你将审视他人的错误，而此前你总是谴责这些错误并对其作出反应。现在，你以不同的觉知审视这些错误，看看它们如何教导你智慧，并向你展示没有内识的生命或试图在没有清晰和觉知的情况下实现幻想和追求的后果。</p>
<p>Here you begin to live a very different kind of life—a life of engagement, a life of clarity, a life where you are discerning the movement of Knowledge within yourself and the movement of life around you. Here you put yourself in a position to gain the maximum value from the guidance, protection and wisdom of Knowledge. It now becomes your guide and compass and replaces your fear, your anxiety, your denial and your self-repudiation that dominated you before. Here you emerge out of the isolation of your own thinking and are able to gain the strength and the courage to face life directly—to consider whatever is emerging over the horizon no matter how difficult it might seem; to become really honest with yourself about where you are in life, who you are with and what you are doing, unwilling now to waste this precious opportunity to be in the world through misapplication of any kind.</p>
<p>在这里，你开始过一种非常不同的生命——一种参与的生命，一种清晰的生命，一种你辨别你内在内识运动和你周围生命运动的生命。在这里，你把你自己放置在一种能够从内识的指导、保护和智慧中获得最大价值的位置。它现在成为你的向导和指南针，取代了之前主宰你的恐惧、焦虑、否定和自我否定。在这里，你摆脱了你自身思维的孤立，能够获得力量和勇气直接面对生命——去考虑地平线上出现的一切，无论它看起来有多么困难；去真正诚实地面对你自己，了解你在生命中的位置、你和谁在一起以及你在做什么，现在不愿意因为任何形式的误用而浪费这个宝贵的存在于世界上的机会。</p>
<p>This is so very important, you see. This is what gives your mind clarity and power. This is what enables Knowledge to shine through.</p>
<p>你看，这非常重要。这能让你的心灵清晰、充满力量。这能让内识闪耀光芒。</p>
<p>It is a very interesting thing, you see, if you are able to sit with anyone who is really wise, you will see they are always listening and watching. They are paying attention fully. Everyone else is chattering away, running around mindlessly, foolishly, without any self-awareness.</p>
<p>这是一件非常有趣的事情，如果你能和真正明智的人坐在一起，你会发现他们总是在倾听和观察。他们全神贯注。其他人都在喋喋不休，漫无目的地四处奔波，愚蠢地，没有任何自我觉知。</p>
<p>But the wise man or woman is watching and listening and paying attention. They are aware of their inner experience. They are aware of their environment. They are aware of who they are talking to. They are really engaged with being here in the world at this time. And they are experiencing a quality of life that escapes everyone else. They are dodging mistakes and avoiding hazards, unlike everyone else. And they are able to fully engage with people and to experience a depth of relationship that escapes everyone else. They look at the world to see where they must go and what they must do, with an inner freedom that is unknown to everyone else.</p>
<p>但明智的男人或女人正在观察、倾听并注意。他们察觉到他们的内在体验。他们察觉到他们的环境。他们察觉到他们在和谁对话。他们真正融入了此时此刻身处这个世界。他们正在体验一种其他人无法体验到的生命品质。他们与其他人不同，正在躲避错误、避开危险。他们能够充分地与人们互动，体验一种其他人无法体验到的深度关系。他们以一种其他人都不知道的内在自由来审视世界，看清自己必须去哪里、必须做什么。</p>
<p>This is the difference that will make all the difference for you and for others. This is the gift of taking the Steps to Knowledge. This is the teaching of God’s New Revelation for the world. Some of these practices are ancient. Some are new. But the New Message puts it all together and gives it great coherence, great clarity and simplicity and great application for your life.</p>
<p>这种差异将对你和他人产生重大影响。这是开展内识进阶的礼物。这是上帝对世界的新启示的教导。其中一些做法是古老的。一些是新的。但新讯息将它们整合在一起，赋予它们伟大的连贯性、伟大的清晰度和简单性，并为你的生命提供伟大的应用。</p>
<p>For you were sent into the world to contribute to the world, in specific ways, in concert with certain individuals. To find this, you must reclaim your life. You must build your connection to Knowledge. You must re-evaluate where you are and learn how you got there in the first place. You must allow Knowledge to reorganize and refocus your life so that it can reflect your deeper nature and your greater purpose for coming into the world at this time.</p>
<p>因为你被派到这个世界上，是为了以特定的方式，与特定的人一起为这个世界做出贡献。为了找到这个，你必须重新找回你的生命。你必须建立你与内识的联接。你必须重新评估你的处境，并学习你最初是如何走到这一步的。你必须允许内识重新组织和重新聚焦你的生命，使它能够反映你更深层次的自然和你此时来到这个世界的更伟大目的。</p>
