<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on November 1, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 11 月 1 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point, it is necessary to begin a spiritual practice because you have to learn to redirect your mind and to open yourself to a deeper experience, to the deeper current of your life. At some point, you need to find out what your deeper nature is really like and the wisdom of Knowledge that God has placed within you—to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to a greater fulfillment in the world and a greater service to humanity.</p>
<p>在某个时刻，有必要开始一种精神练习，因为你必须学会​​重新定向你的心灵，向一种更深层次的体验和你生命更深层次的潮流敞开心扉。在某个时刻，你需要发现你更深层次的自然真正的样子，以及上帝放置在你内在的内识智慧——以指引你、保护你并引领你实现世界上的更伟大成就以及对人类的更伟大服务。</p>
<p>This requires preparation, for it requires a refocusing of the mind and a reordering of one’s life and priorities, and fundamentally a deep evaluation of one’s motives, activities and associations with others.</p>
<p>这需要准备工作，因为它需要重新集中心灵、重新安排一个生命和优先事项，以及从根本上深度评估一个人的动机、活动和与他人的交往。</p>
<p>Here you naturally reach a threshold where you realize that you must carry on this deep evaluation, for you are feeling a deeper need of the soul. The deeper need of the soul is for you to find and fulfill the greater purpose that has brought you into the world and to reunite, through your deeper experience, with those who have sent you into the world and with the Creator of all life.</p>
<p>在这里，你自然而然地到达了一个门槛，你意识到你必须进行这种深度评估，因为你感受到灵魂一个更深层次的需求。灵魂更深层次的需求是让你找到并实现将你带到这个世界的更伟大目的，并通过你更深层次的体验，与那些将你送到这个世界的精神家庭以及与所有生命的创造者重新团聚。</p>
<p>God has assured this possibility by placing Knowledge within you, a deeper intelligence, an intelligence that functions beyond the realm and the sphere of the intellect. This deeper intelligence lives within you. It is providing guidance and counsel continuously, but you do not yet hear it or feel it because you are too preoccupied with your outer life, and your mind is too caught up in its own dilemmas and conflicts.</p>
<p>上帝确保了这种可能性，上帝将内识放置在你的内在，这是一种更深层次的智能，一种超越智力领域和范围运作的智能。这种更深层次的智能就生活在你的内在。它不断地提供指导和忠告，但你尚未听到它或感受到它，因为你太专注于你的外在生命，你的心灵太过陷入它自身的困境和冲突。</p>
<p>Fundamentally, spiritual practice is about bringing your surface mind, your social personal mind—the mind that has been formed and created by your social conditioning, by your family and by your experiences in the world—to bring this mind into contact with the power and the presence of Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>从根本上来说，精神练习就是让你的表面心灵、你社会的个人心灵——通过你的社会条件、你的家庭和你在世界上的经历所形成和创造的心灵——与你内在内识的力量和存在进行接触。</p>
<p>For, in truth, your intellect is meant to serve this greater power. This represents a shift in authority within yourself, a shift from the authority of your beliefs and assumptions and ideas, which are all weak, fallible and incomplete, to a deeper power within you—a power that God has placed within you, a power that is meant to direct your life, to resolve your dilemmas, to free you from addiction and from fantasy, to bring your life into a greater harmony and balance so that you will be able to provide something unique and important for the world.</p>
<p>因为在真理中，你的智力注定要服务于这种更伟大的力量。这代表着你内在权威的一个转变，从你的信仰、假设和想法的权威（它们都是软弱的、易犯错的和不完整的）转向你内在的一种更深层次的力量——一种上帝放置在你内在的力量，一种注定要指导你的生命、解决你的困境、让你摆脱上瘾和幻想、让你的生命进入一种更伟大和谐与平衡的力量，这样你就能够为世界提供某种独特和重要的事情。</p>
<p>To undergo this shift from your beliefs to the power and presence of Knowledge is a tremendous journey that you take. It is like a revolution within yourself, but a revolution that happens slowly and incrementally. And the power that brings this about is entirely natural. It represents a deeper and more profound education and is an essential part of your evolution and development as an individual in the world.</p>
<p>从你的信念到内识的力量和存在的转变，是你踏上的一段艰巨旅程。它就像是你内心的一场革命，但这场革命是缓慢而渐进地发生的。而带来这一切的力量是完全自然的。它代表着一种更深层次、更深刻的教育，是你作为世界上的个体进化和发展的一个必要组成部分。</p>
<p>For you were sent here for a greater purpose, and that purpose is kept by Knowledge within yourself, awaiting the time when you would have the maturity and the seriousness about your life to sincerely inquire and to prepare for the emergence of this Knowledge.</p>
<p>因为你被派到这里是为了一个更伟大目的，而这个目的通过你内在的内识所持有的，等待着你成熟起来，认真对待你的生命，真诚地探究并为这种内识的出现做好准备。</p>
<p>This is not a casual pursuit. This is not something you do periodically when you are disenchanted with the world and you want answers.</p>
<p>这不是一种随意的追求。这不是当你对世界感到失望并想要得到答案时才会定期做的事情。</p>
<p>Here the answer is not merely an idea, or an image, or even a vision. The answer is a door that opens, through which you must pass, a journey to take now—not a journey that is governed by your intellect and your assumptions or the traditional beliefs of society, but a journey that is guided by Knowledge. For only Knowledge knows how to bring you to Knowledge, and only Knowledge knows how to bring you to the Power and Presence of God in your life.</p>
<p>在这里，答案不仅仅是一个想法、一个形象甚至一个远见。答案是一扇打开的门，你必须穿过这扇门，踏上一段现在要踏上的旅程——不是一段由你的智力、你的假设或社会传统信仰所支配的旅程，而是由内识所引导的旅程。因为只有内识知道如何带你走向内识，只有内识知道如何带你走向你生命中上帝的力量和存在。</p>
<p>Whether you have religious affiliations or not, whether you are part of [a] religious tradition or not, this greater journey awaits you. This requires practice and preparation. It does not happen just like that. It requires a set of skills and a deep evaluation of one’s life, beliefs and assumptions. It requires a reconsideration of your past, a resolution of your conflicts, a true forgiveness of your errors and the errors of others. It represents a whole new life.</p>
<p>无论你是否拥有宗教信仰，无论你是否属于宗教传统，这个更伟大的旅程都在等待着你。这需要练习和准备。它不会就此发生。它需要一套技能和对自己的生命、信仰和假设的深度评估。它需要重新审视你的过去，解决你的冲突，真正原谅你的错误和他人的错误。它代表着一种全新的生命。</p>
<p>It is not something you learn in a weekend, or in a month or even a year, for this mountain is a great mountain to climb. And it is in climbing it that you gain the wisdom, the perspective and the skills that you will need.</p>
<p>它不是你一个周末、一个月甚至一年就可以学会的事情，因为这座山是一座值得攀登的高山。攀登这座山，你才能获得所需的智慧、角度和技能。</p>
<p>Like climbing a mountain, it is a series of steps, and actually a series of thresholds as well, where you have to choose again to keep going—thresholds where you lose heart, or you try to compromise yourself, thinking that what you have is good enough, that you will be satisfied with where you are. But Knowledge will keep you moving up this mountain, for you must climb this mountain to have a clear view of the panorama of your life and of the world, a life and a world you cannot see in the valleys and lowlands below.</p>
<p>就像爬山一样，它是一系列的台阶，实际上也是一系列的门槛，你必须再次选择继续前行——在这些门槛上，你会灰心丧气，或者你试图妥协你自己，认为你拥有的已经足够好了，你会满足于你所在的位置。但内识将让你继续攀登这座山，因为你必须攀登这座山，才能清楚地看到你的生命和世界的全景，一个你在山谷和低地里看不到的生命和世界。</p>
<p>There is no way around this. There is no pill that you take, or magic incantation that you make, or secret deal that you make that can bypass this fundamental journey. And you must take it consciously because it will require real self-determination on your part. It will require that you assume command of your ship—command of your life, thoughts and feelings to a very great degree.</p>
<p>这是无法回避的。无论你吃什么药丸，念什么魔法咒语，或达成什么秘密协议，都无法绕过这段根本旅程。你必须有意识地接受它，因为它需要你真正的自决。它需要你掌控你的船——在很大程度上掌控你的生命、思想和感受。</p>
<p>You do not get up a mountain by stumbling around blindly. It takes a real determination and a discovery and application of your greater strength, and a willingness to forgo those attractions and those seductions that have captured your mind and your life before.</p>
<p>盲目地跌跌撞撞是无法爬上山顶的。你需要真正的决心，发现并运用你更伟大的力量，并愿意放弃那些曾经俘获你的心灵和你生命的诱惑。</p>
<p>The Creator of all life has given humanity the teaching in Steps to Knowledge as a pure pathway to follow. It is not the only pathway in the world, certainly, but it is pure and uncontaminated, and it is extremely powerful. But it requires a daily practice, for whatever you practice on a daily basis, you become very good at. You acquire the skills, the abilities and the strength to do something—even something that requires great ability—with tremendous ease and determination.</p>
<p>所有生命的创造者已将内识进阶中的教导赋予人类，作为一条纯净的道路去追随。当然，它不是世界上唯一的道路，但它是纯净、未受污染的，而且极其强大。但它需要日常练习，因为无论你每天练习什么，你都会变得非常擅长。你获得了技能、能力和力量，可以非常轻松和坚定地去做某件事——即使是需要伟大能力的事情。</p>
<p>This daily practice is essential, for every day you are reinforcing your beliefs, your habits and your inclinations. What are those beliefs, those habits and those inclinations? Are you aware of them? Do you see how you are reinforcing your weaknesses, your distractions, your vulnerability to persuasion by others? Do you see, on a daily basis, how you keep your mind preoccupied, rarely ever aware of where you are or what is going on around you, and unaware of the guidance and the power of Knowledge within yourself?</p>
<p>这种日常练习至关重要，因为每天你都在强化你的信念、习惯和倾向。那些信念、习惯和倾向是什么？你察觉到它们了吗？你是否看到你是如何强化你的弱点、你的分心、你对他人说服的脆弱性？你是否看到，在日常生活中，你是如何让你的心灵全神贯注，很少察觉到你在哪里或周围发生了什么，也没有察觉到你内在内识的指导和力量？</p>
<p>People make mistakes primarily because they are not looking and they are not listening. They are not getting their cues from Knowledge within themselves, and they are not understanding their environment.</p>
<p>人们犯错主要是因为他们不去观察，不去倾听。他们没有从他们自己内在的内识中得到提示，也没有理解他们的环境。</p>
<p>It is like driving an automobile while talking on a telephone. People do this, you know, but the truth is they are not really present driving that automobile, and they are not really present speaking on their telephone. They are doing both things at once, but they are living in a hazardous manner. And they are not really conscious of where they are or what they are doing.</p>
<p>它就像一边开车一边打电话。你知道，人们这样做，但真理是他们并没有真正在开车，也没有真正在打电话。他们同时做这两件事，但他们的生活方式是危险的。他们并没有真正意识到他们在哪里或在做什么。</p>
<p>People commit themselves to relationships, to activities, to careers, to disastrous and calamitous activities with this kind of half awareness. They are there, but not really there. They are hearing, but not really hearing. They are looking, but not really seeing. And so they walk into dangerous situations; they make disastrous decisions; they give their lives away to people, places and things. And perhaps they feel the discomfort of this. Perhaps they feel restraint within themselves, but they cannot follow it or understand it. They are only half awake, attracted by reality and by their dreams, all at the same time.</p>
<p>人们带着这种一半的觉知投入到人际关系、活动、事业、灾难性活动中。他们在场，但不是真的在场。他们在听，但不是真的在听。他们在看，但不是真的在看。因此，他们陷入危险境地；他们做出灾难性的决定；他们把他们的生命交给人、地方和事物。也许他们感觉到了这种不适。也许他们感受到内心的束缚，但他们无法遵循或理解它。他们只是半醒半睡，同时被现实和梦想所吸引。</p>
<p>Here your practice is not simply the repetition of a meditation practice, or recitations. Here practice must be a real focus on improving your skills and on refining your intentions. If you just show up every day to do a meditation experience, well, it will have little or no quality if you do not bring your full attention to it.</p>
<p>在这里，你的练习不仅仅是重复冥想练习或背诵。在这里，练习必须真正专注于提高你的技能和完善你的意图。如果你只是每天都去做冥想体验，那么，如果你没有全神贯注，那么冥想的质量就会很低甚至没有。</p>
<p>In learning how to still the mind, you must have a focus, you must be in a quiet place, you must be sitting comfortably, and you must have a passive attitude. Four things are required here. Your passive attitude means you are not aggressively trying to make something happen, or to solve problems, or to engage in other kinds of mental activities. You are just there, in a relaxed manner.</p>
<p>在学习如何静心时，你必须集中注意力，必须身处安静的地方，必须坐得舒服，并且必须保持被动的态度。这里需要四个条件。你的被动态度意味着你不会积极地试图让某事发生，或解决问题，或参与其他类型的心理活动。你只是以一种放松的方式在那里。</p>
<p>So to sit in meditation and experience nothing but agitation or frustration, clearly means you are not meeting the requirements of the situation. You have to be relaxed; you cannot be aggressive. You breathe deeply. Let your breath take you deeper. You have to have a focus for the mind: an image, a thought, an incantation, something that does not stimulate a lot of intellectual activity, something that the mind can anchor itself upon so you can slip beneath its surface into a well of silence. Within this well of silence, deep within it, is the power and the presence of Knowledge.</p>
<p>因此，如果你静坐冥想却只感到焦躁或沮丧，这显然意味着你没有满足情况的要求。你必须放松，不能咄咄逼人。你要深呼吸。让呼吸带你进入更深的境界。你必须让心灵集中于一个焦点：一个形象、一个想法、一个咒语，一些不会刺激大量智力活动的事情，一些心灵可以依托的东西，这样你就可以潜入其表面之下，进入一口寂静之井。在这口寂静之井的深处，蕴藏着内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>Here you learn how to slip beneath the mind. And if the mind is too agitated or too caught up, then you use the mind to contemplate, to think about part of the great Teaching in The Way of Knowledge. If the mind will not allow you to go beneath it, then you should use the mind for contemplation—not to problem solve on the outside, but to consider what your teaching is giving you in relationship to specific things in your life, or to consider what Knowledge has been telling you or indicating regarding a decision that you must make.</p>
<p>在这里，你将学会如何潜入心灵的深处。如果心灵过于焦躁或过于沉迷，那么你就用心灵去沉思，去思考内识之路中伟大教导的一部分。如果心灵不让你潜入其中，那么你就应该用心灵去沉思——不是从外部解决问题，而是思考你的教导在与你生命中的具体事物的关系中给了你什么，或者思考内识在你必须做出的决定中告诉你或指示了什么。</p>
<p>Here your time is always used beneficially, with great intention. You do not simply close your eyes and hope for the best. You are bringing your intention to bear. You are using your situation beneficially. You are not wasting this opportunity.</p>
<p>在这里，你的时间总是被充分利用，并且用心良苦。你不会只是闭上眼睛，希望得到最好的结果。你会将你的意图付诸实践。你会充分使用你的处境。你不会浪费这个机会。</p>
<p>The value of learning to go beneath the mind is that at any moment in life when you need to see something, to know something and to comprehend something, you can switch off your mind. You have that much control over it. Instead of dominating you and oppressing you, your mind here becomes the great tool of communication that it really is.</p>
<p>学会深入心灵的价值在于，在生命中的任何时刻，当你需要看到某件事情、知道某件事情和理解某件事情时，你都可以关掉你的心灵。你对它有那么大的控制力。你的心灵不再主宰你、压迫你，而是变成了真正伟大的沟通工具。</p>
<p>Over time in your practice, you will realize that your mind serves two primary functions: It is either contemplating and problem-solving with the power of Knowledge, or it is still. Experiencing peace is a still mind. And to reach this state, you must be able to go beneath the surface of the mind into the well of silence. You must acquaint yourself with this deeper environment within yourself. Here you cannot be trying to make something happen. You cannot be trying to control the experience. You just have to set your course and maintain that course.</p>
<p>随着你不断的练习，你会意识到你的心灵有两个主要功能：要么用内识的力量进行思考和解决问题，要么保持静止。心灵的静止才能体验到平静。而要达到这种状态，你必须能够深入到心灵的表面之下，进入寂静之井。你必须熟悉你自己内心深处的环境。在这里，你不能试图让某事发生。你不能试图控制体验。你只需要设定你的路线并保持这条路线。</p>
<p>The well of silence is extremely refreshing. Here you are able to hear and to feel and experience the power and presence of Knowledge and what it is indicating for you.</p>
<p>寂静之井令人神清气爽。在这里，你能够听到、感受到并体验到内识的力量和存在，​​以及它对你的指示。</p>
<p>Your spiritual practice, however, goes beyond a formal meditation or contemplation practice. It goes with you into your life. Whenever you are extremely upset about something, ask yourself: Is there something I need here? Is there something I need to know here? Is there something I need to do here? Three questions.</p>
<p>然而，你的精神练习超越了正式的冥想或沉思练习。它会伴随你进入你的生命。每当你对某事感到极度不安时，问问你自己：我需要什么吗？我需要知道什么吗？我需要做什么吗？三个问题。</p>
<p>Here instead of being a victim of your mind, you are using it again for a greater purpose. You are trying to discern your own experience from a place of greater objectivity. Perhaps there is something you need. Perhaps there is something you need to know. Perhaps there is something you need to do. If any of these questions have an answer, you want to put yourself in a position to experience this.</p>
<p>在这里，你不再成为心灵的受害者，而是再次将其用于更伟大的目的。你正试图从更客观的角度来辨别你自身的体验。也许你需要一些东西。也许你需要知道一些东西。也许你需要做一些事情。如果这些问题中的任何一个都有答案，你就会想让你自己处于一个体验这一点的位置。</p>
<p>Your mind is like the ocean. At the surface, it is constantly being whipped up by the winds of the world. It is chaotic, without a clear direction. One day calm, the next day turbulent, and all the storms of the world impact it. But deeper down, your mind is quiet, and there are deeper currents moving your life—currents that have a certain direction, currents that are influenced by greater celestial powers.</p>
<p>你的心灵就像海洋。在表面，它不断被世间的风吹拂。它混乱不堪，没有明确的方向。今天平静，明天动荡不安，世间所有的风暴都冲击着它。但在内心深处，你的心灵是平静的，有更深层次的潮流在推动你的生命——这些潮流有特定的方向，受到更强大的天体力量的影响。</p>
<p>In the ocean, the waters of the world are being moved in a determined manner, all over the planet, but you cannot see these forces from the surface. And you cannot see the great abundance of life within the ocean looking only from the surface. Likewise, looking at your mind from the surface where you live every day, you cannot see its depths, or the greater currents that are moving your life, or the greater purpose for which you have come and to which Knowledge will take you, if you can follow it.</p>
<p>在海洋中，全世界的海水正以一种确定的方式流动着，但你无法从表面看到这些力量。你无法仅从表面看到海洋中丰富的生命。同样，从你每天生活的表面看你的心灵，你无法看到它的深度，无法看到推动你生命的更伟大的潮流，无法看到你来此的更伟大目的，也无法看到内识将带你去往的更伟大目的，如果你能追随它的话。</p>
<p>When you are out in the world, listen within yourself. Watch the world and listen within yourself. This is a practice you can do almost anywhere. It is this attention, both within and without, that allows you to discern the signs of the world and the messages that Knowledge within you is sending you. Instead of being caught up in your ideas, your imagination, your problems, your grievances, your regrets, your desires, your fantasies, your expectations, you are really paying attention.</p>
<p>当你身处世界时，请倾听你自己的内心。观察世界并倾听你自己的内心。这是一种几乎可以在任何地方进行的练习。正是这种内在和外在的关注，让你能够辨别世界的迹象以及你内在内识发送给你的讯息。你不会陷入你的想法、你的想象、你的问题、你的不满、你的遗憾、你的欲望、你的幻想、你的期望中，而是真正地关注着。</p>
<p>People are missing just about everything because they are not paying attention. They are not even enjoying the marvelous reality of life in the moment because they are not paying attention, because their minds are somewhere else.</p>
<p>人们几乎错过了一切，因为他们并不专心。他们甚至没有享受当下生命的美好，因为他们并不关注，因为他们的心灵在别的地方。</p>
<p>When you are waiting for anything is a great time to practice inner listening. When you get on board a bus or a conveyance or around other people, do not judge and evaluate them. Just watch and listen. Ask yourself: What am I looking at here? And listen more deeply than the immediate response of your intellect.</p>
<p>当你在等待任何事情时，都是练习内心倾听的好时机。当你上公共汽车或交通工具时，或者当你与其他人在一起时，不要评判和评价他们。只是观察和倾听。问问你自己：我在这里看到了什么？并且比你的智力的即时反应更深入地倾听。</p>
<p>There is so much time to practice here, it is amazing. So much wasted time through the course of your day when you could be learning to experience your deeper nature while you are out in the world.</p>
<p>在这里，有太多的时间可以练习，它是惊人的。你本可以在外面的世界里学习体验你更深层次的自然，却在一天中浪费了这么多时间。</p>
<p>It is this inner listening and this watching that enable you to see things other people cannot see, hear things that other people cannot hear, and know things that other people cannot know. But this takes great skill, and it takes a compassionate approach, for you are here learning how to serve the world and to understand the world. Instead of judging the world just to reinforce your ideas and your own sense of importance, you are learning how to listen to the world, like a real student, like someone who is not basing their experience on their assumptions.</p>
<p>正是这种内在的聆听和观察，让你能够看到别人看不到的事情，听到别人听不到的声音，知道别人不知道的内识。但这需要伟大的技巧，需要一种富有同情心的方法，因为你在这里学习如何服务世界和理解世界。你不是在评判世界只是为了强化你的想法和你自身重要性的感觉，而是在学习如何倾听世界，就像一名真正的学生，就像一位不以自己的假设为基础来积累经验的人。</p>
<p>Here you are able to experience marvelous things in life—the enjoyment of the moment, the magnificence of the natural world. Here you are able to experience the complexity of human beings and their dual nature—their animal nature and their spiritual nature. You are able to see things in the moment that everyone else is missing. They are all dreaming. They are all caught up in their thoughts and imagination. They are missing life. And they are not seeing things that are important to see.</p>
<p>在这里，你能够体验生命中的奇妙之事——享受当下，感受自然界的壮丽。在这里，你能够体验人类的复杂性及其双重自然——动物性和精神性。你能够看到当下其他人都错过的事物。他们都在做梦。他们都陷入了他们的思想和想象。他们错过了生命。他们没有看到那些重要的事情。</p>
<p>When you are thinking about the future, do not simply think about what you are going to get for yourself, or your fear of losing what you have, or your fear of what may happen to you and to the world. Instead, look over the horizon of life to see what you can see. Within your mind, look over the horizon of life to see what you can see. Ask yourself: What is coming for the world? And what must I do to prepare? This is considering the future from a place of clarity and observation.</p>
<p>当你思考未来时，不要只考虑你自己会得到什么，或者担心失去已有的一切，或者担心你和这个世界会发生什么。相反，要放眼生命的地平线，看看你能看见什么。在你的心灵中，要放眼生命的地平线，看看你能看见什么。问问你自己：这个世界将会发生什么？我必须做些什么准备？这就是从清晰和观察的角度来思考未来。</p>
<p>Refrain from judging or condemning other people, for this is blind, and this prevents you from watching, learning and listening.</p>
<p>不要评判或谴责他人，因为这是盲目的，而且会阻止你观察、学习和倾听。</p>
<p>In conversation with others, listen for what they are really saying. To do this, you have to still your mind and just be quiet, listening. Much of what you hear will be irrelevant, insignificant or even untrue, but you are listening for what is really happening within them. Since people are rarely aware of their own real experience in the moment, you will be able to hear things in them and serve them and speak perhaps more directly to what you are hearing and seeing. This shifts your conversation from being superficial and insignificant into a deeper arena where a true engagement may be possible.</p>
<p>在与他人交谈时，倾听他们真正想说的话。要做到这一点，你必须静下心来，保持安静，倾听。你听到的很多内容可能无关紧要、微不足道甚至不真实，但你倾听的是他们内心真正发生的事情。由于人们很少察觉到他们自身当下的真实体验，你将能够听到他们内心的声音，为他们服务，也许更直接地讲述你所听到和看到的内容。这将使你的谈话从肤浅和微不足道转变为一个更深层次的领域，在那里真正的参与是可能的。</p>
<p>Find places where you can be quiet, where there is very little external noise, and learn to experience the luxury of stillness. At first, it will seem frightening, and you will perhaps feel insecure within it—afraid of what you might feel, afraid of what you might see, afraid of what you might know, afraid of yourself. But really, stillness is a luxury. It is an environment for peace and recognition. It is also an environment for true consideration of your most fundamental decisions.</p>
<p>寻找可以让你安静下来、几乎没有外界噪音的地方，学会体验静止的奢侈。起初，静止似乎令人恐惧，你也许会感到不安全——害怕你可能会感受到什么，害怕你可能会看到什么，害怕你可能会知道什么，害怕你自己。但实际上，静止是一种奢侈。这是一种和平与认知的环境。这也是一种真正考虑你最根本决定的环境。</p>
<p>If your life is busy and noisy all the time, you will never cultivate this awareness of your deeper experience. You will constantly be reacting to your environment, constantly driven, constantly caught up in the superficial conversations and involvements with others, never feeling the deeper current of your life, caught up and unable to hear and to respond to the power and presence of Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>如果你的生命总是忙碌而嘈杂，你将永远无法培养这种对你更深层次体验的觉知。你将不断对你的环境做出反应，不断被驱使，不断陷入与他人的肤浅对话和交往，从未感受到你生命更深层次的潮流，陷入其中而无法聆听和回应你内在内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>Here you are living life, but only at ten percent. You are missing everything else. Running around, busy, caught up, you are missing ninety percent. You are missing the good parts, the best parts. So you want to slow down and have times when you can be quiet in a quiet environment. Even living in the busy big city, you can find these places of sanctuary.</p>
<p>在这里，你过着生命，但只享受了十分之一。你错过了其他一切。四处奔波、忙碌、忙乱，你错过了九成。你错过了美好的部分，最好的部分。所以你想放慢脚步，在安静的环境中享受片刻宁静。即使生活在繁忙的大城市，你也可以找到这些避难所。</p>
<p>You will find, as you begin to respond to the deeper need of your soul—the need to know who you are, and why you are here, and what you are really here to do—you will find that your values will change. Your priorities will change. Instead of stimulation, you seek quiet. Instead of superficial conversations with others, you seek to make a deeper connection wherever that is possible. Instead of constant busyness, you want to slow down so you can experience life around you and the reality of life within yourself. You want to get at the other ninety percent that you have been missing. And you will want to be around other people who feel the same, who have the same deeper motivation.</p>
<p>你会发现，当你开始回应你灵魂的更深层次的需求——需要知道你是谁，你为什么在这里，你在这里真正要做什么——你会发现你的价值观会改变。你的优先事项会改变。你不再寻求刺激，而是寻求安静。你不再与他人进行肤浅的交谈，而是寻求尽可能建立更深入的联系。你不再忙碌，而是想要放慢脚步，这样你就可以体验你周围的生命和你自己内心生命的现实。你想得到你一直错过的另外百分之九十。你会想和其他有同样感受、有同样更深层次动机的人在一起。</p>
<p>When listening to others talk to you, if they are presenting something important, ask yourself: What do I really know about this? Here you are constantly distinguishing the natural experience of Knowledge from your own ideas and beliefs.</p>
<p>在聆听他人与你交谈时，如果他们在讲述一些重要的事情，请问问你自己：我对此真正知道多少？在这里，你不断将内识的自然体验与你自身的想法和信仰区分开来。</p>
<p>Here you begin to realize increasingly that who you are is not your mind, and that your mind is either a window or a wall. Either it enables you to look onto the world, or it prevents you from seeing altogether. And you want to keep this window clean and clear. You do not want it to become clouded and dirty because you want to use it to look out into the world. It is your little command center for being in the world. You want to use it and learn how to use it effectively. You want to use it to discern the real meaning of people and places and events, and the real meaning of your own experience.</p>
<p>在这里，你开始逐渐意识到，你是谁并不取决于你的心灵，你的心灵要么是一扇窗，要么是一堵墙。它要么使你能够看清世界，要么阻止你完全看清世界。你想让这扇窗户保持干净和透明。你不想让它变得模糊和肮脏，因为你想用它来观察外面的世界。它是你在这个世界上的小小指挥中心。你想使用它，并学会如何有效地使用它。你想用它来辨别人物、地点和事件的真正意义，以及你自身经历的真正意义。</p>
<p>Managing the mind and using the mind are a major part of your spiritual practice. In the study of Steps to Knowledge and other spiritual teachings, you learn how to train the mind to think along certain lines so that it can resonate with this deeper intelligence within you and be a vehicle for its expression.</p>
<p>管理心灵和运用心灵是你精神练习的重要部分。在学习内识进阶和其他精神教导时，你将学习如何训练心灵按照某些思路思考，以便它能够与你内在的这种更深层次的智能产生共鸣，并成为其表达的载体。</p>
<p>You have spent years and decades having your mind conditioned by your culture, by your family, by your friends and by the world at large. You have been daily practicing and reinforcing all of these influences and the conclusions that you have made from them.</p>
<p>多年来，你的心灵一直受到你的文化、你的家庭、你的朋友和整个世界的制约。你每天都在实践和强化所有这些影响以及你从中得出的结论。</p>
<p>Now you must exert real effort to redirect your mind, to refocus your mind and to realize who you are is not the mind. You want to keep that window clean and clear. You want to learn to use the mind as the beautiful vehicle of communication that it really is and that it is meant to be. It is a perfect servant. It should never be the master. And it makes a very poor god.</p>
<p>现在，你必须付出真正的努力来调整你的心灵，重新聚焦你的心灵，并认识到你不是心灵。你要保持这扇窗的干净和透明。你想学会把心灵当作一种美妙的沟通工具，它确实是，也应该成为。它是一个完美的仆人。它永远不应该成为主人。它是一个非常可怜的神。</p>
<p>You want to use the mind instead of being used by it. That is so very important. That shifts the authority from your ideas to a deeper power within yourself. But it is not easy to do. It is not easy to undo and to go against years and decades of social conditioning, and to learn how to re-evaluate your past experiences in such a way that you can get the maximum value from them.</p>
<p>你想使用心灵，而不是被心灵所使用。这非常重要。这将权威从你的想法转移到你自己内心一种更深层次的力量。但这并不容易做到。要消除和对抗多年甚至几十年的社会制约，并学会如何重新评估你过去的经历，以便从中获得最大价值，这并不容易。</p>
<p>You carry unforgiveness within yourself because you feel wounded by people and by circumstances. And you have not forgiven these people and these circumstances because you have not gained the real value from them—what they taught you about the need for Knowledge and the consequences of living without Knowledge, what they have taught you about what real wisdom is and the consequences of living without wisdom.</p>
<p>你内心怀有不宽恕，因为你感到被人们和环境所伤害。你没有原谅这些人和这些环境，因为你没有从他们身上获得真正的价值——他们教给你关于内识的必要性以及没有内识生命的后果，他们教给你关于什么是真正的智慧以及没有智慧生活的后果。</p>
<p>When you gain sufficient value from a previous encounter with a person or with a painful event, then you begin to see it very differently. It was still unpleasant, of course. Perhaps it could have been avoided. But it is also giving you something, and you are using it. And this is tempering your discontent and your resentment.</p>
<p>当你从与某人或痛苦事件的先前遭遇中获得足够的价值时，你就会开始以完全不同的方式看待它。当然，它仍然是不愉快的。也许它本来可以避免。但它也给了你一些东西，而你正在使用它。这正在缓和你的不满和怨恨。</p>
<p>This is all part of your spiritual practice, you see. Everywhere you go, everything that you do, every person that you are with is an environment for spiritual practice. This will seem like a lot of effort at the outset, but really what it is asking you to do is to be present and mindful of where you are and what you are doing, to listen to the power and the presence of Knowledge within yourself, and to know that not everything that you experience is coming from your five senses, that you are seeing beyond the limits of the body.</p>
<p>你看，这都是你精神练习的一部分。你去的每一个地方，你做的每一件事，你身边的每一个人都是精神练习的环境。这在开始时似乎需要付出很多努力，但实际上它要求你做的是活在当下，注意你在哪里，你在做什么，倾听你内在内识的力量和存在，​​并知道你所体验到的并非一切都来自你的五种感官，你所看到的超越了身体的界限。</p>
<p>One of the difficulties that people have is they try to use spiritual practice to reinforce their preferred ideas and beliefs. They want to use life as a resource to reaffirm their ideas and their beliefs. This is still self-deceptive because really you want to use your ideas and beliefs to reaffirm life. You want life to teach you what is true, not to try to use life to reinforce what you think is true. Here again people constantly confuse reality with their own thoughts. They confuse the intellect with the power of Knowledge within themselves.</p>
<p>人们面临的困难之一是他们试图用精神练习来强化他们偏爱的想法和信念。他们想用生命作为一种资源来重申他们的想法和信念。这仍然是自欺欺人，因为你实际上想用你的想法和信念来重申生命。你希望生命教会你什么是真理，而不是试图用生命来强化你认为是真理的东西。在这里，人们又一次不断地将现实与他们自身的思想混淆。他们把智力与他们自己内在的内识力量混淆了。</p>
<p>So this is an ongoing problem, and it requires an ongoing attention. You do not undo decades of social conditioning in a weekend or a month or a year. It is ongoing, you see, but it is moving in the right direction. Your progress may seem slow, but you are moving in the right direction, at last. Instead of digging a deeper hole for yourself, living in a greater experience of darkness, confusion and isolation, you are moving out. You have turned the great corner, and now you are moving in a positive direction.</p>
<p>因此，这是一个持续存在的问题，需要持续关注。你不可能在一个周末、一个月或一年的时间里消除数十年的社会制约。你看，这是一个持续存在的问题，但它正在朝着正确的方向发展。你的进步可能看起来很缓慢，但你终于在朝着正确的方向发展。你没有给你自己挖一个更深的坑，没有生活在更大的黑暗、困惑和孤立之中，而是正在走出去。你已经转过弯了，现在你正朝着积极的方向前进。</p>
<p>Your intellect will be impatient. It wants answers. It wants conclusions. It wants what it wants right now. It does not want to wait. It is impatient because it is insecure, and it is insecure because it is not grounded in your true reality. The mind is nervous. It is afraid. It is constantly searching. It is aggravated. It is living in its own kind of Hell, the Hell of Separation.</p>
<p>你的智力会变得不耐烦。它想要答案。它想要结论。它想要现在就得到它想要的东西。它不想等待。它不耐烦是因为它没有安全感，它没有安全感是因为它没有扎根于你的真正现实。心灵是紧张的。它是害怕的。它在不断地寻找。它是烦躁的。它生活在它自身的地狱里，分离的地狱里。</p>
<p>The world teaches you that your mind is your god, and that you should appeal to other minds that are stronger than your mind for guidance and counsel. The world teaches you that who you are is your mind and your body, both of which are fallible and can easily be damaged and destroyed.</p>
<p>这个世界告诉你，你的心灵就是你的神，你应该向比你心灵更强大的心灵寻求指导和建议。这个世界告诉你，你的自然是你的心灵和你的身体，两者都是会犯错的，很容易受到损坏和摧毁。</p>
<p>So in the mind, you live in a constant state of fear and apprehension. And the only way you can escape this is through fantasy and through acquisition—the pursuit of people, places and things. And you become obsessed here because without this, you feel the profound insecurity and anxiety of the mind.</p>
<p>因此，在心灵中，你一直生活在恐惧和忧虑的状态中。而你唯一能逃避这种状态的方法就是通过幻想和获取——追求人、地方和事物。你对此变得痴迷，因为没有这些，你就会感受到心灵中深深的不安全感和焦虑。</p>
<p>Once your mind begins to serve a greater power within yourself, however, you begin to undo the foundation of its insecurity. It is insecure because it is separate, because it does not have a greater power to serve. It was designed to serve. But if it has nothing to serve but itself, then it falls into disarray, and its true capabilities are not realized.</p>
<p>然而，一旦你的心灵开始服务于你自己内在的更伟大力量，你就开始瓦解其不安全感的基础。它不安全是因为它是分离的，因为它没有一种更伟大的力量去服务。它被设计来服务。但如果心灵除了它自己之外没有别的事情可以服务，那么它就会陷入混乱，其真正的能力就无法实现。</p>
<p>That is why Knowledge within you gives direction to the mind, gives restraint to the mind, begins to direct the mind—naturally, appropriately, for this is the true nature of your existence. In the true hierarchy of your Being, your body serves your mind and your mind serves Knowledge, or Spirit, and your Spirit serves God.</p>
<p>正因为如此，你内在的内识会指引心灵，约束心灵，开始引导心灵——自然而然地、恰当地，因为这是你存在的真正自然。在你存在的真正层级中，你的身体服务于你的心灵，你的心灵服务于内识或精神，你的精神服务于上帝。</p>
<p>When people begin their spiritual practice, this hierarchy of being is all upside down. People’s minds are serving their body, and they are trying to use Spirit as a kind of resource to serve their mind. The whole approach is off. It is incorrect.</p>
<p>当人们开始练习时，这种存在的层级就完全颠倒了。人们的心灵服务于他们的身体，他们试图利用精神作为一种资源来服务于他们的心灵。整个方法都是错误的。这是不正确的。</p>
<p>So this all has to be unlearned. Your life has to be brought into its true balance and function. And this takes time and learning and re-evaluation.</p>
<p>因此，这一切都必须被忘却。你的生命必须恢复到真正的平衡和功能。这需要时间、学习和重新评估。</p>
<p>It is difficult to live in your natural state if you have been living in an unnatural life previously, governed by habit and convention and the expectations of others. To live without Knowledge is to live an unnatural life—a life of constant aggravation, anxiety and the need for escape.</p>
<p>如果你以前过着一种不自然的生命，受制于习惯、惯例和他人的期望，那么很难生活在你的自然状态中。没有内识的生活就是过着一种不自然的生命——一种不断烦恼、焦虑和需要逃避的生命。</p>
<p>Here even relationships represent a release, a need for escape. And that is the creation of romance and the whole fantasy of romance, which actually has very little to do with whether you can actually be in relationship with another person successfully or not.</p>
<p>在这里，甚至关系也代表着一种释放，一种逃避的需求。这就是浪漫的创造和整个浪漫的幻想，这实际上与你是否能成功地与另一个人建立关系几乎没有关系。</p>
<p>This need to escape your own anxiety, your own discomfort, leads to endless pursuits, endless distractions, none of which can resolve your fundamental problem. And your fundamental problem is your mind is not connected to Knowledge within yourself, so the mind and the Spirit are disconnected.</p>
<p>这种逃避你自身的焦虑，你自身不适的需求，导致了无尽的追求、无尽的分心，而这些都无法解决你的根本问题。你的根本问题是你的心灵没有与你内在的内识相连接，因此心灵和精神是脱节的。</p>
<p>The mind is in disarray, caught up in the world—lost, frustrated, desperate. It either becomes a miserable servant of others or a cruel tyrant. There are many roles the mind can assume for itself here, but fundamentally it is out of accord and out of relationship with your deeper nature.</p>
<p>心灵处于混乱之中，被世界所困——迷失、沮丧、绝望。它要么成为他人的可怜仆人，要么成为残忍的暴君。心灵可以扮演许多角色，但从根本上讲，它与你更深层次的自然不一致，也缺乏联系。</p>
<p>It is your spiritual practice that will bring your mind and your body into real relationship with your deeper nature. This will give you a sense of integrity. This will allow you to feel right about your life. This will give you the criteria to bring your life into balance and harmony, to withdraw from relationships and involvements that have no purpose and no future and no chance of success, to refocus your life, to reorient your life to where Knowledge wants to take you, to where your heart wants to go.</p>
<p>正是你的精神练习将使你的心灵和你的身体与你更深层次的自然建立真正的关系。这将赋予你一种完整性的感觉。这将使你对你的生命感到满意。这将赋予你标准，让你的生命保持平衡与和谐，让你摆脱没有目的、没有未来、没有成功机会的关系和参与，让你重新聚焦你的生命，让你的生命重新定位到内识想要带你去的地方，你的心想要去的地方。</p>
<p>You still have all the problems of living in the physical reality: the problems of providing for yourself, the problems of establishing stability, the problems of learning how to communicate effectively with other people. But you are now being guided by a real power within yourself. And this will allow you to feel that your life is meaningful and has a real purpose and a real destiny, even if you cannot define these things for yourself.</p>
<p>你仍然面临生活在物质现实中的所有问题：养活你自己的问题、建立稳定的问题、学习如何与他人有效沟通的问题。但你现在正受到你内在一种真正力量的引导。这将让你感觉到你的生命是有意义的，有一个真正的目的和一个真正的天命，即使你无法你为自己定义这些事情。</p>
<p>Everything you do, everyone you are with, every activity, is an opportunity to deepen this connection as a conscious act—to cultivate your awareness of Knowledge and to learn how to discern Knowledge from all the other voices in your mind, all of the forms of deception within yourself and in the world around you.</p>
<p>你做的每一件事，和你在一起的每个人，每项活动，都是一个机会，以一种有意识的行为来深化这种联接——培养你对内识的觉知，并学习如何从你心灵中的所有其他声音、从你内在以及你周围世界的所有欺骗形式中辨别内识。</p>
<p>This is the great journey in life, more important than success, wealth, beauty, charm, acquisition and the approval of others.</p>
<p>这是生命中的伟大旅程，比成功、财富、美貌、魅力、获得和他人的认可更重要。</p>
<p>This is why you were sent into the world. Here instead of just being a human being who has some spiritual nature somewhere, you are really a spiritual being working through your humanity, working through the limits of the mind and the body, and the limits placed upon you by the world around you.</p>
<p>这就是你被派到这个世界的原因。在这里，你不仅仅是一个拥有某种精神自然的人，你实际上是一个精神存在，通过你的人性、通过心灵和身体的极限以及周围世界对你的限制来工作。</p>
<p>Because you were sent here for a greater purpose, you are like an angel in the world, trying to function within the confinements of living within a body and trying to use the mind effectively to communicate with others and to discern correctly the world around you.</p>
<p>因为你是为了一个更伟大目的被派到这里，你就像世界上的一个天使，努力生活在身体的局限里运作，努力有效地运用心灵去与他人沟通，并正确辨识你周围的世界。</p>
<p>Over time, you will identify more and more with Knowledge because it is reliable, it is deep, and it is powerful. It is everything your intellect is not. And you will feel that your life has a greater foundation—a foundation beyond this world—and this will give you the experience of being in the world but not of the world, providing you with a sense of security and continuity and strength that nothing in the world could ever provide for you. This will give you the strength to weather and to endure and to learn from life’s tragedies and disappointments, from the disappointment in other people and their tragic decisions for themselves. This will give you the strength to endure personal loss and times of great confusion and frustration.</p>
<p>随着时间的推移，你将越来越多地认同内识，因为它是可靠的，它是有深度的，它也是强大的。它是你的智力所不具备的一切。你将感觉到你的生命拥有一个更伟大基础——一个超越这个世界的基础——这将给你身处世界但不属于世界的体验，给你一种安全感、连续性和力量感，这是世界上任何东西都无法给予你的。这将给你力量去经受、去忍受并从生命的悲剧和失望中、从对其他人的失望以及他们为他们自己做出的悲剧性决定中学习。这将给你力量去忍受个人的损失和巨大困惑和挫折的时刻。</p>
<p>Here your current runs deep and is not destroyed by your outer experiences. Here your purpose remains, regardless of what happens on the outside. What happens on the outside just changes how you will try to communicate the meaning that you are experiencing within yourself.</p>
<p>在这里，你的当下是有深度的，不会被外在的经历所摧毁。无论外界发生什么，你的目的依然存在。外界发生的事情只是改变了你试图传达你自己内心所经历的意义的方式。</p>
<p>The outer world will require constant adaptation and problem solving—constant problems, obstacles and difficulties along the way. But you are anchored in a deeper reality now. It is not a reality that is based upon ideas or ideology. It is the power and presence of Knowledge, which is beyond estimation and definition.</p>
<p>外部世界将需要不断适应和解决问题——一路上不断出现问题、障碍和困难。但你现在锚定在一个更深层次的现实里。它不是一个基于想法或意识形态的现实。它是内识的力量和存在，​​它超越估计和定义。</p>
<p>Here your greater gifts will emerge, and your life will be an inspiration and a great service to others, according to your original design and intent. This fulfills the need of the soul, which is your deepest and most profound need.</p>
<p>在这里，你的伟大礼物将显现出来，你的生命将激励他人，为他人提供伟大的服务，这符合你最初的设计和意图。这满足了灵魂的需求，这是你最深切、最深刻的需求。</p>
<p>If you were able to satisfy all other needs, this would remain for you as the most fundamental and important need. Beyond meeting the basic requirements of taking care of your body and your mind, this is your greatest need.</p>
<p>如果你能够满足所有其他需求，那么这对你来说仍然是最基本、最重要的需求。除了满足照顾身体和心灵的基本需求外，这是你最大的需求。</p>
<p>Satisfy this and you will have a satisfaction and a sense of permanence that nothing in the world can destroy. And you will be a light unto the world. And your service to the world will be profound and in many cases inexplicable.</p>
<p>满足了这一点，你就会有一种满足感和永恒感，世界上没有任何东西可以摧毁它。你将成为世界的一束光。你对世界的服务将是深远的，在许多情况下是无法解释的。</p>
<p>It is your spiritual practice that will take you there. And in time you will realize that everything you do is a practice and a reinforcement, [that] everything you think is a practice and a reinforcement, that you are practicing and reinforcing all the time, whether you are aware of it or not. So here you choose to practice what really needs to be practiced, to utilize the gifts of Knowledge and the great Revelations that have been given throughout time and the great Revelation that is now being given to humanity through a New Message from God.</p>
<p>正是你的精神练习将带你到达内识。随着时间的推移，你会意识到你所做的一切都是一种练习和一种强化，你所想的一切也是一种练习和一种强化，无论你是否意识到，你一直在练习和强化。所以在这里，你选择练习真正需要练习的事情，善用内识的礼物和历代以来被赋予的伟大启示，以及现在通过来自上帝的新讯息赋予人类的伟大启示。</p>
<p>May the power and presence of Knowledge guide you and bless you and teach you what is good from what only looks good, and show you the real current of your life and the pathway to connect with others. Only Knowledge knows these things, and it is these things that you most desperately need. May this power guide you, correct you, restrain you and prepare you for a greater life and a greater service to the world.</p>
<p>愿内识的力量和存在指引你、祝福你、教导你什么是好的，什么是仅仅看上去好的，并向你展示你生命的真正潮流和与他人联系的道路。只有内识知道这些，而这些正是你最迫切需要的。愿这股力量指引你、纠正你、约束你，并让你为更伟大的生命和对世界的更伟大服务做好准备。</p>
