<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 16, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 10 月 16 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You were born with two minds—a surface mind that has been conditioned by the world; conditioned by your cultures, your family, religion perhaps; conditioned by your experiences, your decisions, your regrets and your resentments. The surface mind is unstable. It is fundamentally insecure.</p>
<p>你生来就有两个心灵——一个是受世界影响的表面心灵；一种受你的文化、你的家庭、也许还有宗教影响的表面心灵；一种受你的经历、你的决定、你的遗憾和你的怨恨影响的表面心灵。表面的心灵是不稳定的。它从根本上来说是不安全的。</p>
<p>But you have a deeper Mind, a Mind that has been created by God, a Mind that We call Knowledge because your experience of it will produce profound experiences of Knowledge [knowing] and intuition. Knowledge is very unlike your surface mind. It is quiet. It is certain. It is not afraid. It does not speculate. It does not debate. It does not argue. It does not project blame. It is not governed by fear and insecurity. It is quiet. It is deep. It watches and waits. It sees. It knows. And it prompts dramatic and courageous action.</p>
<p>但你有一个更深层次的心灵，一个由上帝创造的心灵，一个我们称之为内识的心灵，因为你对它的体验将产生对内识知道和直觉的深刻体验。内识与你的表面心灵非常不同。它是安静的。它是确定的。它不会害怕。它不会推测。它不会辩论。它不会争论。它不会指责。它不受恐惧和不安全感的支配。它是安静的。它是有深度的。它观察和等待。它看见。它知道。它促使采取戏剧性和勇敢的行动。</p>
<p>You cannot govern this deeper Mind with your surface mind. You cannot use it as a resource. Spirit is not a resource for the mind. You cannot use it to win contests, or to manipulate other people or to gain advantages. In fact, really, your intellect is a resource for Knowledge in the true hierarchy of your Being.</p>
<p>你无法用你的表面心灵来控制这个更深层次的心灵。你无法把它当作一种资源。精神不是心灵的资源。你无法用它来赢得比赛，操纵他人或获得优势。事实上，你的智力是你存在真正层级中内识的资源。</p>
<p>Yet the reality that your mind is trying to use Spirit, and this is true for most people, at least at the outset of their self-discovery, shows you how backwards and upside down your approach really is and that this is the condition of humanity. In fact, it is the condition of manifest life, intelligent life in the universe.</p>
<p>然而，你的心灵试图使用精神，而这对大多数人来说都是如此，至少在他们自我发现的开始阶段，这个事实表明你的方法是多么的落后和颠倒，而这正是人类的状况。事实上，它是宇宙中显化生命的状况，也是智能生命的状况。</p>
<p>God has given you Knowledge to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to a greater fulfillment in life—a fulfillment based upon your higher purpose for coming here, a higher purpose that only Knowledge knows.</p>
<p>上帝已经赋予你内识，来指引你、保护你并引领你走向生命的更伟大成就——这个成就基于你来到此地的更高宗旨，这个更高宗旨唯有内识知道。</p>
<p>Knowledge is mysterious. It cannot be defined. It is not something the intellect can conceptualize effectively. It seems mysterious because you cannot control it, you cannot define it and you cannot put it into a simple explanation.</p>
<p>内识是神秘的。它无法被定义。它不是智力能够有效概念化的东西。它看起来很神秘，因为你无法控制它，无法定义它，也无法用简单的解释来解释它。</p>
<p>Some people are afraid of Knowledge for this reason. They feel it is unpredictable, and they cannot be in control of it, and so it frightens them. They are afraid to be guided by something that they do not fully understand. That is because the intellect wants to be the ruler of their life. It wants to use Spirit as a resource. It wants to feel in control. It wants to be in charge. This, of course, is all born of a fundamental confusion, the confusion that is the result of living in Separation.</p>
<p>有些人就是因为这个原因而害怕内识。他们觉得内识不可预测，他们无法控制它，所以内识让他们感到害怕。他们害怕被他们不完全理解的东西所引导。这是因为智力想要成为他们生命的主宰。它想要利用精神作为一种资源。它想要感觉自己在掌控之中。它想要掌控一切。当然，这一切都源于一种根本性的困惑，这种困惑是生活在分离中的结果。</p>
<p>You who have come from God’s permanent Creation now have to function as an individual and have to deal with the changing circumstances of the world—constantly problem solving, constantly trying to adapt, constantly trying to negotiate and navigate the difficult and uncertain times of life. The intellect has been given prominence here. It has an extremely necessary role to play, but it is not a god. It is not the final arbiter of reality. It is not the ultimate truth. And it is not the Greater Reality of your life.</p>
<p>你从上帝的永恒创造中走来，现在必须作为一个个体进行运作，必须应对世界不断变化的境况——不断解决问题，不断努力适应，不断努力协商和驾驭生命中的艰难和不确定时期。智力在这里得到了突出的体现。它扮演着极其必要的角色，但它不是神。它不是现实的最终仲裁者。它不是终极真理。它也不是你生命的更伟大现实。</p>
<p>All spiritual practice, in whatever form or tradition, is to fundamentally enable your thinking, surface mind to connect with the deeper Mind of Knowledge. For God speaks to you through Knowledge. God provides guidance, restraint and inspiration through Knowledge. God redeems the separated through Knowledge.</p>
<p>所有的精神练习，无论形式或传统如何，都是从根本上使你的思维、表面的心灵与更深层次的内识心灵相连接。因为上帝通过内识与你对话。上帝通过内识提供指导、约束和灵感。上帝通过内识救赎分离者。</p>
<p>Instead of trying to comprehend the ultimate reality of God, or trying to escape the reality of being in the world by attempting to achieve some higher or ultimate state, as you might conceive of it, real spiritual practice is to connect with Knowledge and to yield to Knowledge. This is how God redeems you.</p>
<p>真正的精神练习不是试图理解上帝的终极现实，也不是试图通过努力实现某种更高或终极状态来逃避身处世界的现实，正如你可能想象的那样，真正的精神练习是与内识连接并屈服于内识。这就是上帝救赎你的方式。</p>
<p>Some people believe that God is managing every aspect of their life, that everything that happens to them is some kind of guidance by God. So they try to understand why their life is not working very well, why they are not feeling very good, why their mental and physical health is so compromised—trying to assign everything to God. But God is not managing the daily affairs of your life. The Creator of the entire universe is not being focused on managing your daily affairs. This is, of course, ridiculous.</p>
<p>有些人相信上帝掌管着他们生命的方方面面，他们身上发生的每一件事都是上帝的某种指引。所以他们试图理解为什么他们的生命不太顺利，为什么他们感觉不太好，为什么他们的身心健康受到如此损害——试图把一切都归咎于上帝。但上帝并没有掌管你的日常生命。整个宇宙的创造者并没有专注于管理你的日常生活。这当然是荒谬的。</p>
<p>But God has put Knowledge within you to guide you, to keep you from going astray, to keep your life focused on the true direction it was meant to follow, to bring into your life a greater certainty, a greater power and a greater ability to communicate with others at a deeper level. To the extent that you experience Knowledge and are connected to Knowledge consciously, these powers begin to emanate in your life, and you find you have the strength to overcome seductions and manipulation, to overcome your own self-destructive tendencies, whereas before you did not have this power. You could not override these tendencies within yourself.</p>
<p>但是上帝把内识放置在你的内心来指引你，阻止你误入歧途，让你的生命专注于它本应遵循的真正方向，给你的生命带来更伟大的确定性、更伟大的力量和更伟大的能力，以便在更深层次的层面上与他人沟通。随着你体验内识并有意识地与内识联接，这些力量开始在你的生命中散发，你会发现你有力量克服诱惑和操纵，克服你自身的自我毁灭倾向，而之前你没有这种力量。你无法超越你内在的这些倾向。</p>
<p>Therefore, spiritual practice is about connecting with the deeper current of your life. Knowledge is speaking to you, but you cannot yet hear it because your mind is so preoccupied, so caught up at the surface, so dominated by external forces and influences that you cannot feel and hear the power and the presence of Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>因此，精神练习就是与你生命中更深层次的潮流相连接。内识在对你说话，但你还听不到，因为你的心灵如此专注，如此沉迷于表面，如此被外部力量和影响所支配，以至于你无法感受到和听到你内在内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>People think that Knowledge is just fleeting moments of intuition, and while they might value this intuition, rarely do they track it to its source. Rarely do they really take the Steps to Knowledge. They try to benefit from these fleeting experiences perhaps, but they do not know where they come from. So the real power and ability within themselves—their core strength, the source of their integrity and power in the world—is never discovered.</p>
<p>人们认为内识只是直觉的瞬间，尽管他们可能重视这种直觉，但他们很少追寻它的源头。他们很少真正踏上内识之路。他们可能试图从这些转瞬即逝的经历中获益，但他们不知道这些体验从何而来。因此，他们自己内心真正的力量和能力——他们的核心力量，他们在世界上的完整性和力量的源泉——从未被发现。</p>
<p>It is not enough to stand by the well and hope that the message will issue forth. You have to get into that well. You have to make a deeper connection. You have to exert the effort and take the steps to this deeper source of power and inspiration, breaking free from the surface sufficiently so that you can make this deeper connection.</p>
<p>站在井边，仅仅希望讯息能够传播出来是不够的。你必须进入这个口井。你必须建立更深层次的联接。你必须付出努力，迈出步伐，去寻找更深层次的力量和灵感之源，充分挣脱表面的束缚，从而建立更深层次的联接。</p>
<p>God is holding you back, moving you forward, restraining you from this, moving you towards that, but if your mind is caught up at the surface with its judgments and its fears, its beliefs, its attitudes, its ambitions, its fantasies, well, all is being lost upon you, who are meant to be the recipient of God’s Power and Grace.</p>
<p>上帝正在阻止你，也在推动你前进，阻止你做这事，推动你走向那事，但如果你的心灵被它的判断和恐惧、它的信仰、它的态度、它的野心、它的幻想所困扰，那么，你将会失去这一切，而你本应是上帝的力量和恩典的接受者。</p>
<p>Knowledge is trying to move your life in a certain direction, but if you keep trying to move your life in a different direction, you will feel a tremendous inner conflict and uncertainty. And the more willful you are, the more determined you are to take your life where you think it should go, the greater this conflict will be, and the more you will be disassociated from your deeper nature and the deeper current of your life.</p>
<p>内识正在试图将你的生命推向某个方向，但如果你一直试图将你的生命推向不同的方向，你将感受到巨大的内在冲突和不确定性。你越是任性，你越是坚定地将你的生命引向你认为它应该去的地方，这种冲突就会越严重，你就会越脱离你更深层次的自然以及你生命更深层次的潮流。</p>
<p>This disassociation is the fundamental problem and source of suffering for people. Beyond sheer physical deprivation from lack of food, water, shelter or sufficient security, this is the source of people’s anxiety. It is the source of their longing. It is what they are attempting to find in their relationships, what they are seeking through their pursuits and their acquisitions—this feeling of being connected, of being whole, of escaping the plaguing and driving sense of fear and inadequacy.</p>
<p>这种分离是人们的根本问题和痛苦之源。除了缺乏食物、水、住所或足够的安全而导致的纯粹身体匮乏之外，这还是人们焦虑的根源。这是他们渴望的根源。这是他们试图在人际关系中找到的东西，他们通过追求和获得寻求的东西——这种联接感、这种完整感、这种逃离困扰和驱动的恐惧感和不足感的感觉。</p>
<p>The answer is within you, but you must bring your life into a kind of focus and orientation in order for this Knowledge to emerge. It is not like pulling a rabbit out of a hat. Your life must be moving in the direction it is meant to move. Then you will feel the movement of Knowledge within yourself. If you keep trying to go somewhere else to have all these things you think you want or need without understanding whether they are really in alignment with Knowledge within yourself, then you will be in perpetual conflict. And the need of your soul will go unmet.</p>
<p>答案就在你的内心，但你必须将你的生命带入某种焦点和方向，以便让这种内识浮现出来。它不像从帽子里变出一只兔子。你的生命必须朝着它应该前进的方向前进。然后你就会感受到你内心内识的运动。如果你一直试图去别的地方得到你认为你想要或需要的所有这些东西，却不理解它们是否真的与你内心的内识相一致，那么你将陷入永久的冲突之中。你灵魂的需求将得不到满足。</p>
<p>Even if you are successful in your pursuits and are able—through sheer determination or manipulation and deception of others—you are able to achieve your personal goals, you have made no progress at all if you are not moving in the direction that your life is meant to go. In fact, you have taken yourself farther afield, and you will feel restless and incomplete as a result.</p>
<p>即使你在追求中取得了成功，并且能够——通过坚定的决心或操纵和欺骗他人——实现你的个人目标，但如果你没有朝着你生命应该去的方向前进，你就没有取得任何进步。事实上，你把你自己带得更远了，结果你会感到不安和不完整。</p>
<p>Even if you achieve wealth and are surrounded by luxuries, you will be restless and discontented because the deeper need of your soul has gone unmet, and you have taken yourself so far afield, so far off course, that you do not know where you are now. You are lost, and your life is empty. You keep trying to have more things, do more things, have more experiences to somehow offset this feeling of inadequacy and longing. You keep the mind stimulated, focused and preoccupied, but deep within you, you know you are not living the life you are meant to live.</p>
<p>即使你变得富有，被奢侈品包围，你也会感到不安和不满，因为你灵魂深处的需求没有得到满足，你已经走得太远，偏离了轨道，你不知道你现在在哪里。你迷失了，你的生命是空的。你一直试图拥有更多的东西，做更多的事情，拥有更多的经验，以某种方式抵消这种不足和渴望的感觉。你让心灵保持兴奋、专注和专心，但在内心深处，你知道你没有过上你应该过的生命。</p>
<p>It is this awareness and this dissatisfaction that finally can enable you to make a fundamental shift and a re-evaluation of your life and circumstances. It is this dissatisfaction that is the light of hope, the light at the end of the tunnel, a sign that great change may be achievable. When you stop pretending that you are happier than you really are, when you stop identifying with all your possessions and accomplishments and begin to tell the truth about your deeper experience, then you realize there is a greater need within you that is calling for you and that you must respond to.</p>
<p>正是这种觉知和这种不满最终能够让你做出根本性的转变，重新评估你的生命和境况。正是这种不满是希望之光，是隧道尽头的光明，是实现伟大改变的标志。当你不再假装你比实际更快乐，当你不再认同你所有的财产和成就，并开始说出你更深层次体验的真理时，你就会意识到你内心有一个更伟大的需求在召唤你，你必须回应它。</p>
<p>This requires that you listen to the movement of Knowledge. This is the beginning of your spiritual practice, your practice in stillness and listening. In this practice, you are not trying to get anything; you are not trying to have realization; you are not trying to have new ideas; you are not trying to have answers or remedies for your problems. You are listening and you are still.</p>
<p>这要求你倾听内识的运动。这是你的精神练习的开始，你的静止和聆听的练习。在这种练习中，你不会试图得到任何东西；你不会试图获得领悟；你不会试图拥有新的想法；你不会试图为你的问题找到答案或补救措施。你正在倾听，你保持安静。</p>
<p>At first, this stillness is a kind of frustration because you begin to see how erratic your thinking is and how dominated you are at the surface of your mind. Many people lose heart here and give up and feel that they are dealing with an overwhelming force. They cannot seem to override the constant stimulation of their imagination. Their mind is so agitated and so driven that when you begin your practice in stillness, that’s all you experience, and it is unpleasant, and it is shocking. But if you have a deeper focus and are in a quiet environment and are sitting comfortably, if you persist, you will begin to sink your awareness down beneath the surface.</p>
<p>起初，这种静止是一种挫败感，因为你开始看到到你的思维是多么的飘忽不定，你的心灵是多么的被表面所支配。很多人在这时灰心丧气，放弃了，感觉他们正在与一股势不可挡的力量打交道。他们似乎无法克服想象力的不断刺激。他们的心灵是如此焦躁不安，如此冲动，以至于当你开始在静止中练习时，你只会经历这些，这令人不快，也令人震惊。但如果你集中注意力，处在一个安静的环境中，坐着很舒服，如果你坚持下去，你的觉知就会开始沉入表面之下。</p>
<p>Perhaps you will have to sit for thirty minutes or an hour before you begin to sink down below the surface. You must have a point of focus. It can be an image; it can be something that you see with your eyes half closed; it can be the words “Na Rahn”; it can be a sound. It cannot be significant or stimulate your imagination. It must be something very simple that you focus on. And this allows you to sink down beneath the turbulence of your surface mind.</p>
<p>也许你需要坐上三十分钟或一个小时，才能开始沉入表面之下。你必须有一个焦点。它可以是一个图像；它可以是你半闭着眼睛看到的东西；它可以是“Na Rahn”这个词；它可以是一个声音。它不能是重大的或激发你的想象力的东西。它必须是你关注的非常简单的东西。这样，你就能在表面心灵的动荡中沉淀下来。</p>
<p>When you begin to have this experience, it will seem like you are approaching a state of emptiness, that there really is emptiness there. For some people, this is frightening and gives rise to anxiety. But emptiness just means you are not being stimulated at the surface.</p>
<p>当你开始有这种体验时，你会觉得你正在接近一种空虚的状态，那里真的有空虚。对一些人来说，这是可怕的，并会引起焦虑。但空虚只是意味着你没有受到表面上的刺激。</p>
<p>You are entering a more quiescent state. The mind will still pull you back, but you are able to continue to sink beneath it. And you are awake. You are not asleep. You are not dreaming. You are present.</p>
<p>你正进入一种更加宁静的状态。心灵仍会把你拉回来，但你能够继续沉浸其中。你醒了。你没有睡着。你没有在做梦。你在场。</p>
<p>This state of quiet is immensely refreshing. It is refreshing to the mind. That is why you sleep at night—to refresh and to rest your mind. It is refreshing to the mind. It is not about getting things. It is not about shopping and buying. It is not like your constant pursuit at the surface, trying to have things and driven by the fear of not having. Here you are just floating, free from the aggravation, the stress and the turbulence of life at the surface. Now you are going deeper in the ocean of consciousness, where things are much more still. Life may be raging at the surface, but you are living now in a moment of stillness.</p>
<p>这种安静的状态令人精神焕发。它使心灵焕然一新。这就是你晚上睡觉的原因——让你的心灵焕然一新、休息一下。它使心灵焕然一新。它不是关于得到东西。它不是关于购物和购买。它不像你在表面上不断追求，试图拥有东西，却被没有的恐惧所驱使。在这里，你只是漂流着，摆脱了表面生命的烦恼、压力和动荡。现在你正在意识的海洋中走得更深，那里的一切都更加平静。生命可能在表面上肆虐，但你现在生活在一个静止的时刻。</p>
<p>Keeping your focus on your words, your sound or your image, you are able to hold this. Your senses begin to open. Your ears begin to open. And as you become used to this state and are able to achieve it more frequently, then you begin to feel there is a deeper consciousness and a deeper conscience within you, that what seemed like emptiness is actually a deeper awareness.</p>
<p>把注意力集中在你的话语、声音或形象上，你就能保持这种状态。你的感官开始打开。你的耳朵开始打开。当你习惯了这种状态，并能够更频繁地达到这种状态时，你就会开始感觉到你内心有一种更深层次的意识和一种更深层次的良知，那种看似空虚的状态实际上是一种更深层次的觉知。</p>
<p>This awareness is not agitated. It is not filled with imagination. It is not running all over the place. It is not flitting from the past to the future. It is just there, a great and powerful Presence. What is important here is not to try to understand because that just puts you right back at the surface, but to be there and to experience it—to breathe it in, to acclimate yourself to its presence. You are just there. You are not trying to get anything, solve anything, resolve anything, avoid anything. You are just there.</p>
<p>这种觉知没有焦躁不安。它没有充满想象。它没有到处乱窜。它没有从过去飞向未来。它就在那里，一个伟大而强大的存在。这里重要的不是试图去理解，因为那只会让你回到表面，而是在那里，去体验它——去呼吸它，让你自己适应它的存在。你就在那里。你没有试图去得到任何东西，解决任何事情，化解任何困难，避免任何事情。你就在那里。</p>
<p>Then when your meditation practice is over, you can come back into the world in a more quiescent state, a more aware state, a more observant state, and it will be very refreshing for you—refreshing like taking a hot shower after being out working in the heat of the day, refreshing to the mind.</p>
<p>然后，当你的冥想练习结束时，你就可以以一种更加安静、更加警觉、更加善于观察的状态回到这个世界，这会让你感到非常神清气爽——就像在白天最热的时候出去工作后洗个热水澡一样，让心灵得到放松。</p>
<p>As you are able to have this experience, which will be very intermittent and perhaps infrequent at the outset, but as this grows for you, you will be able to refer to this deeper state and listen to it and for it. You will see you feel one way at the surface, but at a deeper level, the feeling is different.</p>
<p>当你能够拥有这种体验时，一开始这种体验会非常断断续续，可能不频繁，但随着这种体验的不断增长，你将能够参考这种更深层次的状态，倾听它，为它而努力。你会发现你表面上的感觉是一种方式，但在更深层次的层面上，感觉是不同的。</p>
<p>In facing an important decision, at the surface you will try to calculate the benefits and the liabilities, the pros and the cons of the decision. But deeper down, it is either a yes or a no or there is nothing, which means it is not important now. Sometimes the yes or the no is strong or weak, which means you must proceed with caution.</p>
<p>面对一个重要决定时，表面上你会试图计算这个决定的利弊。但更深层次的是，它要么是肯定的，要么是否定的，要么什么都没有，这意味着它现在并不重要。有时肯定或否定是强势或弱势的，这意味着你必须谨慎行事。</p>
<p>Instead of just trying to have an answer, you have to experience what this means at a deeper level. It is not enough that you just have answers. It is more important that you have awareness and comprehension, for an answer is but for the moment, but comprehension is for your whole life.</p>
<p>你不只是试图找到答案，你还必须更深入地体验这意味着什么。光有答案是不够的。更重要的是你有觉知和领悟，因为答案只是暂时的，而领悟是为了你整个生命。</p>
<p>Over time, your reference to this deeper state will allow information to come into your mind from Knowledge itself. As you listen to other people, have your mind become still. Do not try to engage or follow their line of thinking. Just listen and become still. Things will come into your mind periodically that are really a breakthrough of understanding. As you learn to do this, you will experience that what people are saying is not what they mean and that they are really communicating at another level that is barely recognized by anyone around them.</p>
<p>随着时间的推移，你对这个更深层次的状态的关注将允许来自内识本身的信息进入你的心灵。当你聆听他人时，让你的心灵保持静止。不要试图参与或跟随他们的思路。只是聆听并保持静止。一些事情会定期进入你的心灵，这确实是一种理解的突破。当你学会这样做时，你将体验到人们所说的并不是他们想要表达的意思，他们实际上是在另一个层面上进行交流，而周围的人几乎都无法认识到这一点。</p>
<p>From this deeper experience of Knowledge, you will feel restraint about certain things—things that may attract you, things that might look profitable or beneficial or pleasurable. You will look at them, and your mind will begin to become tantalized, but deeper down, there is a restraint.</p>
<p>从这种对内识的更深层次体验中，你将对某些事物感到克制——那些可能吸引你的事物，那些可能看起来有利可图或有益或令人愉悦的事物。你将看着它们，你的心灵将开始受到诱惑，但在更深处，存在着一种克制。</p>
<p>Knowledge cannot be seduced. It cannot be induced to do things that go against its nature and its design. That is why it has such great power in the world and is so immensely reliable and trustworthy.</p>
<p>内识是无法被诱惑的。它无法被诱导去做违背其自然和设计的事情。这就是为什么它在世界上拥有如此强大的力量，如此可靠和值得信赖。</p>
<p>You have two minds within you. You need to pay attention to the deeper Mind. You do this through your practice in stillness and inner listening. And you do this out in the world when you remind yourself to clear your thoughts and to just be present and observant. All the time, when you are waiting for something—waiting for a bus, waiting at a stoplight, waiting in a line of people, you can be practicing stillness and inner listening. If you are driving an automobile, you can be practicing listening and watching, fully alert. Turn off the radio at home. Turn off the television. Step away from your computer machine.</p>
<p>你内心有两个心灵。你需要关注更深层次的心灵。你通过练习静止和内心的聆听来做到这一点。当你提醒你自己清空思绪，只是在场、观察时，你也能在外面的世界做到这一点。无论何时，当你在等待某事时——等公交车、等红绿灯、排队等候时，你都可以练习静止和内心的聆听。如果你在开车，你可以练习聆听和观察，保持高度警惕。关掉家里的收音机。关掉电视。远离你的电脑。</p>
<p>If you are faced with an important decision, listen to see how Knowledge is responding. You might try to weigh the choices. That is okay. But you must come back to Knowledge in the end. You may ask yourself: “Should I make this decision?” You will feel it; you will sense it if there is a response.</p>
<p>如果你面临一个重要的决定，听听内识是如何回应的。你可以试着权衡选择。这没有问题。但你最终必须回到内识那里。你可以问你自己：“我应该做这个决定吗？”你会感觉到它；如果有回应，你会感觉到它。</p>
<p>Many people ask questions that do not need to be asked or are trying to make decisions that they are not ready to make, so they do not receive anything from Knowledge. Again, Knowledge will not just give you spot answers. It is giving you awareness. It is giving you insight. It is preparing you for the future. You are making an engagement. Do not seek this relationship just to get ideas or spot answers to your questions because you cannot use Knowledge as a resource.</p>
<p>许多人问一些不需要问的问题，或者试图做出他们还没有准备好的决定，因此，他们没有从内识那里得到任何东西。再说一次，内识不会只给你即兴的答案。它给你觉知。它给你洞察力。它正在为你准备未来。你正在进行一种参与。不要只是为了获得想法或问题的即兴答案而寻求这种关系，因为你不能把内识当作一种资源。</p>
<p>This is a teaching and a preparation. God is not your servant, serving your wandering desires, your erratic thinking. If you are going to come to the deeper power that God has placed within you, you must come to give yourself. You must come in a sacred manner—not to get something, not to steal something, not to get your answer. If that is your intent, Knowledge will be silent, for you are not ready to make the real engagement that must be made.</p>
<p>这是一种教导和准备。上帝不是你的仆人，服务于你游移不定的欲望、你飘忽不定的思维。如果你要来到上帝放置在你内在的更深层次的力量面前，你必须给予你自己。你必须以一种神圣的方式到来——不是为了得到什么东西，不是为了偷什么东西，不是为了得到你的答案。如果这是你的意图，内识将保持沉默，因为你还没有准备好做出必须做出的真​​正参与。</p>
<p>Knowledge is not going to give you what you want, but it will give you what you need. And it will direct your life and redirect your life so that it can move in a positive direction as it was destined to do, according to a greater purpose that has brought you into this world at this time to face the circumstances of life that are emerging now.</p>
<p>内识不会给你你想要的东西，但它会给你你需要的东西。它将指引你的生命，重新引导你的生命，这样它就能朝着积极的方向前进，就像它注定要做的那样，根据一个更伟大目的，这个目的在此时将你带到这个世界，面对现在正在出现的生命境况。</p>
<p>Once you enter life, nothing is certain except Knowledge within you. There is no guarantee your life will work out, that you will find your greater purpose, that you will meet the people you really must meet, that you will have great advantages. There is no guarantee. There is only the power of Knowledge.</p>
<p>一旦你进入生命，除了你内在的内识，没有什么是确定的。没有人能保证你的生命会顺利，没有人能保证你会找到你更伟大的目的，没有人能保证你会遇到你真正必须遇见的人，没有人能保证你会拥有伟大的优势。没有任何保证。只有内识的力量。</p>
<p>You have a body. You have a mind. You must learn to direct them and to nurture their health and their integrity. You must be strong physically, strong mentally, strong emotionally and free to respond to the deeper power that God has placed within you.</p>
<p>你有一个身体。你有一个心灵。你必须学会​​引导它们，培育它们的健康和完整性。你必须身体强健、心智强健、情绪强健，并自由地回应上帝放置在你内在的更深层次的力量。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must come to give yourself. You must come with humility. You do not come as a thief in the night. You must come to develop your skills in inner listening and being in a state of silence, sitting quietly. Learn to escape the agitation of your surface mind. It is not just about being at peace. It is about making a real connection to the deeper Intelligence within you.</p>
<p>因此，你必须去给予你自己。你必须带着谦逊来。你不是夜贼。你必须来发展你的内在聆听技能，并处于沉默状态，静静地坐着。学会摆脱你表面心灵的烦躁。这不仅仅是为了保持和平。它是关于与你内心深处的一种智能建立真正的联接。</p>
<p>Your mind is like the ocean. At the surface, it is being swept by the weather and the winds of the world—one day quiet, the next day stormy, erratic, irrational, with no certain movement, turbulent, unpredictable. But at a deeper level, there are currents moving the waters of the Earth, like a conveyor belt, moving the waters from one part of the world to another, with a deeper certainty and regularity.</p>
<p>你的心灵就像海洋。从表面上看，它被世界的天气和风吹拂——今天平静，明天暴风雨肆虐，反复无常，毫无理性，没有确定的运动，动荡不安，不可预测。但在一种更深层次的层面上，有水流在推动地球的水流，就像一条传送带，将水从世界的一个地方转移到另一个地方，具有一种更深层次的确定性和规律性。</p>
<p>This is a good analogy for your mind. At the surface—turbulent, slavish, being whipped up by the world, full of fear and desire, anxiety and insecurity, but at a deeper level, there is a greater movement and a deeper current.</p>
<p>这是一个很好的类比，适合你的心灵。表面上看——动荡、奴性、被世界鞭策、充满恐惧和欲望、焦虑和不安全感，但在一种更深层次的层面上，存在着一种更伟大的运动和一种更深层次的潮流。</p>
<p>When you look at the ocean from the surface, you can see very little life in it. Perhaps you will see whales or birds at the surface, but most of the life in the ocean you cannot see from the surface.</p>
<p>当你从海面看海洋时，你只能看到其中很少的生物。也许你会在海面上看到鲸鱼或鸟类，但海洋中的大部分生物你从海面上是看不到的。</p>
<p>Here again the analogy is appropriate because you cannot really see the greater life of your life from the surface. You think it is just a big, empty darkness down there, and you do not want to go there because you are afraid of the dark. You do not want to take that stairway down into the deeper realms because you feel afraid and uncertain there.</p>
<p>在这里，这个比喻再次恰当，因为你无法从表面真正看到你生命中更伟大的生命。你认为那只是一片巨大、空虚的黑暗，你不想去那里，因为你害怕黑暗。你不想走下那条通往更深层次的阶梯，因为你在那里感到害怕和不确定。</p>
<p>You want to stay at the surface clinging to your beliefs, clinging to your habits, clinging to your agreements with other people, your social contracts and so forth, living like a slave to external forces. But at least you are not alone. You have plenty of company there.</p>
<p>你想停留在表面，坚守你的信仰、你的习惯、你与他人的约定、你的社会契约等等，像外力的奴隶一样生活。但至少你并不孤单。你有很多同伴。</p>
<p>But deeper down, God has given you the deeper current of your life. You may pray for deliverance and guidance, but God has given you Knowledge, and you must take the Steps to Knowledge. This requires that you find a way through your practice, your spiritual practice, to move beneath the surface of your mind.</p>
<p>但在内心深处，上帝已经赋予了你生命中更深层次的潮流。你可以祈求解脱和指引，但上帝已经赋予了你内识，你必须开展内识进阶。这要求你通过你的练习、你的精神实践，找到一种方式，深入到你心灵的表面之下。</p>
<p>You give your mind something to focus on—a sound, a word, something that does not excite your imagination. The mind has a focus, and you are able to slip beneath the surface. And it is a whole different world down there. It is quiet. It is immense. And there is a greater life than you could discern from the surface.</p>
<p>你让你的心灵专注于某件事——一个声音、一个词、一些不会激发你想象力的东西。心灵有了焦点，你就能潜入表面之下。那里是一个完全不同的世界。它很安静。它很广阔。那里有比你从表面所能辨别的更伟大的生命。</p>
<p>People try to get Knowledge to give them what they want at the beginning. They want insight. They want answers. They want clarification because they are afraid, and they are trying to get Knowledge to give them the things they want. They use it as a kind of divination to get what they want.</p>
<p>人们一开始就试图让内识给他们想要的东西。他们想要洞察力。他们想要答案。他们想要澄清，因为他们害怕，他们试图让内识给他们想要的东西。他们用它作为一种占卜来得到他们想要的东西。</p>
<p>But Knowledge does not respond to this kind of ambition or attempt at manipulation. If that is your approach, Knowledge will be silent with you because you are not coming in a reverent manner. You are not coming from a position of humility. Knowledge has more than an answer to give you. It is here to give you a greater life, a life that is perhaps different, moving in a different direction than what you are trying to achieve for yourself.</p>
<p>但是内识不会回应这种野心或操纵的企图。如果这是你的方式，内识将对你保持沉默，因为你不是以一种虔诚的方式而来。你不是从谦逊的立场而来。内识能给你的不只是一个答案。它在此是为了给你一个更伟大的生命，一个或许不同的生命，一个朝着与你试图为你自己实现的目标不同的方向前进的生命。</p>
<p>People are trying to have wealth; they are trying to have power; they are trying to have relationships; they are trying to avoid poverty and deprivation. All this is understandable, of course. But you are here for a greater purpose. You cannot figure this out with your intellect, for its reality is beyond the realm of the intellect. You can only come to it and learn of it and choose its direction and have it be revealed to you gradually over time, as you are able to conceive of it and to embody it and to follow it.</p>
<p>人们试图拥有财富；他们试图拥有权力；他们试图拥有关系；他们试图避免贫穷和匮乏。当然，所有这些都是可以理解的。但是你来到这里是为了一个更伟大的目的。你无法用你的智力去理解它，因为它的现实超越了智力的范畴。你只能走向它，学习它，选择它的方向，让它随着时间的推移逐渐向你揭示，因为你能够构想它、体现它和遵循它。</p>
<p>Knowledge is moving in a direction. The deeper currents of the ocean are moving in a direction. It has very little to do with the climate or the daily weather. Your life has a deeper movement, a deeper current. It is not caught up in the drama of your life at the surface.</p>
<p>内识在朝着一个方向前进。海洋深处的潮流也在朝着一个方向前进。它与气候或日常天气关系不大。你的生命有一种更深层次的运动，一种更深层次的潮流。它不会被你表面生命的戏剧性所困扰。</p>
<p>So for you to experience it, you must learn to be still, and to listen, and to respond, and to feel what Knowledge is indicating at a deeper level—and not just for a moment here and there, but in a much more complete sense, for you are really establishing your most primary relationship here. You do not establish your relationship with another person once in a while when you need something from them. That is a relationship of convenience, certainly, but it is not a real, deeper bond.</p>
<p>因此，为了体验它，你必须学会​​保持安静，聆听，回应，感受内识在更深层次的层面上所指示的事情——不只是片刻之间，而是在一种更完整的意义上，因为你在这里真正建立了你最主要的关系。你不会在偶尔需要另一个人什么事物的时候才与他们建立关系。这当然是一种权宜之计，但它不是一种真正的、更深层次的纽带。</p>
<p>Knowledge is your most primary relationship because it represents your relationship with God. This is where you make the Divine connection, with Knowledge within yourself and Knowledge within others. When you respond to the deeper Knowledge in another and are inspired by this, you are making a connection with God and God’s Presence in the world. You do not make a connection with God by having lofty and subtle thoughts, or a magnificent theological construction, or by praising and worshipping and pleasing and worshipping. That will mean nothing if you cannot follow the deeper current of your life.</p>
<p>内识是你最主要的关系，因为它代表着你与上帝的关系。这是你与你自己内在的内识和他人内在的内识建立神圣连接的地方。当你回应他人内在更深层次的内识并受到启发时，你就是在与上帝以及上帝在世界上的存在建立连接。你无法通过拥有崇高而微妙的思想，或宏伟的神学建构，或通过赞美和崇拜、取悦和崇拜来与上帝建立连接。如果你不能追随你生命中更深层次的潮流，那将毫无意义。</p>
<p>Your yielding to God cannot simply be a gesture or a series of ceremonies. It must really happen on the inside. It must liberate you from the surface mind so that you can feel the movement of life. You can feel when Knowledge is restraining you. You can feel and experience when Knowledge is moving you or encouraging you to do something specific.</p>
<p>你对上帝的臣服不能只是一种姿态或一系列仪式。它必须真正发生在你的内心。它必须将你从表面的心灵中解放出来，这样你才能感受到生命的运动。当内识在约束你时，你可以感觉到。当内识在推动你或鼓励你去做某件具体的事情时，你可以感觉到和体验到。</p>
<p>In the future, as you develop your practice and take the Steps to Knowledge, you will be aware of these two realities concurrently. You will be responding to the world, and your mind will be functioning at that level, but you will always have this awareness of Knowledge.</p>
<p>在未来，随着你发展你的实践并开展内识进阶，你将同时察觉到这两个现实。你将对世界做出回应，你的心灵也将在这个层面上运作，但你将始终拥有对内识的这种觉知。</p>
<p>People often think of this in terms of the mind and the heart. They think, “Well, you think thoughts, and you believe in certain things, and perhaps you base your life on that, but then your heart has a different kind of movement and intelligence.” As long as you do not associate all of your emotions with your heart, this might function as a model. Many people will use this model and can use it successfully as long as they realize that Knowledge is beyond the mind and the body. You might experience Knowledge more in the region of your heart because it is more based upon feeling and experience than simply ideas and ideology, but Knowledge is greater than your physical life. It is in the world, but not of the world.</p>
<p>人们常常从心灵和内心的角度来思考这个问题。他们认为，“好吧，你有思想，你相信某些事情，也许你的生命也是基于此，但你的心却有着不同的运动和智能。”只要你不把所有的情绪都与你的心联系在一起，这也许可以作为一种模式。只要他们意识到内识超越了心灵和身体，许多人都会使用这个模式，他们就能成功地使用它。你可能会在你内心的区域体验到更多的内识，因为它更多地基于感觉和体验，而不仅仅是想法和意识形态，但内识比你的物质生命更伟大。它存在于世界，但不属于世界。</p>
<p>With Knowledge, it will be ever more difficult for you to make a mistake in discerning relationships. You could try to marry someone because of their beauty, their wealth or their charm, but Knowledge will not go with you. You may try to win someone over because they are stimulating your imagination, or you are addicted to their personality, but Knowledge will not go with you.</p>
<p>有了内识，你将更难在辨别关系时犯错误。你可以因为某人的美貌、财富或魅力而试图与其结婚，但内识不会跟随你。你可以因为某人激发了你的想象力，或者你沉迷于他们的人格而试图赢得他们的芳心，但内识不会跟随你。</p>
<p>In contrast, when you meet someone in your life who really is important, and you have a resonance with them, a deeper connection, and this connection is deep and abiding, it is not merely imaginary or fragmentary or momentary, then Knowledge will say: “Yes. Make a connection with this person.”</p>
<p>相反，当你在生命中遇到一个真正重要的人，你与他们产生共鸣，建立一种更深层次的联接，而这种联接是深刻而持久的，它不仅仅是想象的、零碎的或短暂的，那时内识会说：“是的。和这个人建立一种联接。”</p>
<p>But you might have to wait. You cannot have everything right now. Perhaps you will meet your true partner five years from now. What will you do in the interim? Get married to someone else? Have affairs? Take advantage of other people for your pleasure or your needs?</p>
<p>但你可能需要等待。你不可能现在就拥有一切。也许五年后你会遇到真正的伴侣。在这期间，你会做什么？和某个人结婚？有外遇？为了你的快乐或你的需求而利用他人？</p>
<p>This is why it takes immense patience. That is why you practice stillness. That is why you learn to sink beneath the turbulent surface of your mind—to refresh yourself, to clarify your thoughts, to seek reprieve from the stress of the outer world and to feel the presence and the power of Knowledge and its guidance for you.</p>
<p>这就是为什么需要极大的耐心。这就是为什么你要练习静止。这就是为什么你要学会沉入你心灵的混乱表面之下——让你自己恢复活力，理清思绪，寻求摆脱外部世界压力的缓解，感受内识的存在和力量以及它对你的指导。</p>
<p>You do not talk to Knowledge like it is another personality because it does not function like this. You cannot have a conversation with Knowledge. It is not chatty like your surface mind. It is the part of you that is wise, and if you come to it foolishly or in a way that is deceptive, it will not respond to you. It will be like there is nothing there. But if you come to develop your skills—learning to be still and silent, learning to be present, learning how to clear your mind—then you will experience this deeper Presence beneath the surface.</p>
<p>你不会像对待另一个人格那样和内识交谈，因为它不是这样运作的。你无法和内识对话。它不像你的表面心灵那样喋喋不休。它是你明智的一部分，如果你愚蠢地或以一种欺骗的方式接近它，它将不会回应你。它会像什么都没有一样存在。但如果你来发展你的技能——学习保持静止和沉默，学习在场，学习如何清理你的心灵——那么你将体验到表面之下的这种更深层次的存在。</p>
<p>These skills are so valuable because when you are out in the world and engaged with people and activities, if you can clear your mind at any moment, then you open yourself to a deeper insight and a deeper recognition. You are able to hear what people are really saying. You are able to discern the dynamics of the situation. You are able to see the dangers in certain decisions, the hazards in certain circumstances. You are able to stop yourself and to become discerning and watchful.</p>
<p>这些技能非常宝贵，因为当你走出去，与人交往、参与各种活动时，如果你能随时清空你的心灵，那么你就能获得一种更深层次的洞察力和一种更深层次的认知。你能够听到人们真正在说什么。你能够辨别情况的动态。你能够看到某些决定中的危险，某些情况下的危害。你能够阻止你自己，变得敏锐和警惕。</p>
<p>This is of such immense value because most people make mistakes because they are not paying attention, or they are being guided by ambition or desire or fear. They are not being objective. They are not being discerning. They are just driving themselves forward or allowing themselves to be seduced and controlled by someone else. People give in to the will of others. This happens all the time.</p>
<p>这具有极大的价值，因为大多数人犯错是因为他们没有注意，或者他们被野心、欲望或恐惧所引导。他们不客观。他们没有谨慎。他们只是驱使他们自己前进，或者允许他们自己被别人诱惑和控制。人们屈服于他人的意志。这种情况一直在发生。</p>
<p>So this ability to sink beneath the surface, to still and clear your mind, to become a watcher and a listener, objectively—without projecting blame, without associating yourself with anything—is of immense practical importance and must be brought to bear to every important decision you make regarding your relationship with people, with places, with things, with money, where you live, how you live, where you go, what you do. This is where you break the chains that bind you. This is where doors open in your life, inside yourself and all around you.</p>
<p>因此，这种能够沉入表面之下、保持心灵的冷静和清醒、客观地成为一个观察者和倾听者的能力——不指责他人、不将你自己与任何事物联系起来——具有极大的实际意义，必须影响到你所做的每一个重要决定，包括与人、与地点、与事物、与金钱、与居住地、如何生活、去哪里、做什么的关系。这就是你打破束缚你锁链的地方。这就是你生命中的大门打开的地方，无论是在你自己内心还是在你周围。</p>
<p>This ability to clear your thoughts, to become sober, to stop your dreaming and your frantic thinking, to step back from persuasion from others, is of such immense value it will save your life. Over and over, it will save your life.</p>
<p>这种能力可以让你理清思绪，变得清醒，停止幻想和疯狂的思考，不再受到他人的说服，它具有极大的价值，可以挽救你的生命。一次又一次，它可以挽救你的生命。</p>
<p>Knowledge is like the Earth. In imagination, you are floating above the Earth, but when you come back down to Earth, there is a kind of fundamental awareness. This is just an analogy, of course, but if you can imagine that within yourself is a deeper foundation, a deeper Knowledge, a deeper Mind, then you will see if you are floating around the surface and are disconnected from this deeper foundation, then you are simply functioning without any guidance, like a ship without a rudder. You are going off course all the time. You are being swept by the winds of the world. Like a little boat on the ocean with no sail, you are just going to be knocked about, driven, and eventually you will sink.</p>
<p>内识就像地球。在想象中，你漂浮在地球之上，但当你回到地球时，就会有一种基本的觉知。当然，这只是一个比喻，但如果你能想象你自己内心有一种更深层次的基础，一种更深层次的内识，一种更深层次的心灵，那么你就会看到，如果你漂浮在水面上，与这个更深层次的基础脱节，那么你就只是在没有任何指导的情况下运作，就像一艘没有舵的船。你一直在偏离航向。你被世界的风吹拂着。就像大海上没有帆的小船，你只会被撞来撞去，被驱赶，最终你会沉没。</p>
<p>That is why your relationship with Knowledge is the most important relationship. It is your first responsibility. It is your relationship with God. This is where you make your connection. God is not an idea. Who you are is not an idea. God is not a thing, an object. Who you are is not a thing or an object.</p>
<p>正因为如此，你和内识的关系是最重要的关系。它是你的首要责任。它是你与上帝的关系。这是你建立联接的地方。上帝不是一个想法。你是谁不是一个想法。上帝不是一个事物、一个物体。你是谁不是一个事物或一个物体。</p>
<p>You connect with God by bringing your surface mind under the direction of Knowledge within yourself. This is more significant than just having intuitive experiences now and then. This is a fundamental relationship that you are bringing yourself to because you see that without it, you are lost in the world. Rich or poor, you are lost in the world. Even surrounded by luxury, you are lost in the world. You are empty. You are frustrated. You are dissatisfied. You are insecure—like a child lost in the world.</p>
<p>你通过把你的表面心灵放置在你内在内识的指导之下来与上帝联接。这比仅仅偶尔拥有直觉体验更加重要。这是你把你自己带入的一种根本关系，因为你会看到，没有内识，你就会迷失在世界上。无论富有还是贫穷，你都会迷失在世界上。即使被奢侈品包围，你也会迷失在世界上。你是空虚的。你是沮丧的。你是不满意的。你是没有安全感的——就像一个迷失在世界上的孩子。</p>
<p>I am giving you the secret here, the most important secret, the deepest connection, the most important connection, the connection that will satisfy the deepest need in your life, which is the need of the soul—the need for you to find and fulfill your greater purpose here.</p>
<p>我在这里告诉你一个秘密，最重要的秘密，最深层次的联接，最重要的联接，这个联接将满足你生命中最深层次的需求，这是灵魂的需求——你在此找到并实现你更伟大目的的需求。</p>
<p>You have a destiny in the world. You have a greater purpose. And God has given you Knowledge to give you the power and the ability to find this purpose, to experience it, to embrace it and to fulfill it. The world here will call out of you your greater purpose. This will bring you in relationship with the world in the truest sense. It will enable you to establish the most meaningful and profound relationships with other people and with certain individuals in particular. It will end your ceaseless searching. It will free you from addiction and self-destructive behavior. It will give you a guide and a compass to navigate the great uncertain times to come.</p>
<p>你在世界上有一个天命。你有一个更伟大目的。上帝已经赋予你内识，赋予你力量和能力去发现这个目的、体验它、拥抱它并实现它。这里的世界将召唤你的更伟大目的。这将带你以最真实的意义与世界建立关系。它将使你能够与其他人、特别是与特定的个体建立最有意义和最深刻的关系。它将结束你无休止的探索。它将让你摆脱上瘾和自我毁灭的行为。它将为你提供一个指南和一个指南针，来驾驭未来巨大的不确定时期。</p>
<p>May Knowledge grow strong within you who have been born for a greater purpose. May you give yourself to taking the Steps to Knowledge and to allowing this great relationship to come into your awareness and to be the guiding light of your life. May the inspiration and your gifts to the world emanate from you. And may you be a source of inspiration for others, giving them the gift that has been given to you.</p>
<p>愿内识在你内心茁壮成长，因为你生来就肩负着一种更伟大的目的。愿你全身心地投入内识的进阶，让这种伟大的关系进入你的觉知，成为你生命的指路明灯。愿你为世界带来灵感和礼物。愿你成为他人的灵感之源，给予他们你所得到的礼物。</p>
