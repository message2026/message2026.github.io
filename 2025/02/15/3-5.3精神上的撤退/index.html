<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on September 9, 2009 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2009 年 9 月 9 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important to take a spiritual retreat periodically, and particularly at times when important decisions are in front of you. A spiritual retreat here is not simply an escape from your outer life or a reprieve from your outer duties and responsibilities. Instead, spiritual retreat is a time to focus on the power and presence of Knowledge within yourself, the deeper Intelligence that the Creator of all life has placed within you to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to your greater accomplishments in life.</p>
<p>定期进行精神上的撤退是重要的，尤其是在你面临重要决定的时候。精神上的撤退不仅仅是逃离外在生命或暂时摆脱外在的职责和责任。相反，精神上的撤退是专注于你自己内在内识的力量和存在的时间，这是所有生命的创造者放置在你内在的更深层次的智能，用来指导你、保护你并引领你取得生命中更伟大的成就。</p>
<p>It is important to see what Knowledge is indicating for you. Often these indications go unnoticed because you are too busy, too caught up. Your life is too full of too many things. That is why you have to withdraw from the outer world, withdraw from your primary relationships, withdraw from your normal activities to seek spiritual retreat.</p>
<p>重要的是要看到内识在向你指示什么。这些指示常常被忽视，因为你太忙了，忙得不可开交。你的生命中有太多的事情。这就是为什么你必须退出外部世界，退出你的主要关系，退出你的正常活动，去寻求精神上的撤退。</p>
<p>You cannot carry out this retreat if you are constantly being influenced by normal things in your daily life—conversations, the media, problems to solve, obligations to others, things to consider and all the myriad of things that people engage in, whether they be practical or fanciful. Spiritual retreat is stepping back from the outer life and your outer self, to experience your inner life and your deeper nature, which are represented by Knowledge.</p>
<p>如果你不断受到日常生命中普通事物的影响——对话、媒体、要解决的问题、对他人的义务、要考虑的事情以及人们所从事的所有各种各样的事情，无论它们是实际的还是幻想的，那么你就无法进行这种撤退。精神上的撤退就是从外在生命和你的外在自我中后退一步，去体验你的内在生命和你更深层次的自然，它们由内识所代表。</p>
<p>Withdraw, then, and take refuge in a different place, if possible. If not possible, then take a vow of silence regarding the people you may be living with, and withdraw to the quietest place you can. Take this time, which may span several days or even weeks—a kind of vacation from the outer world, a reprieve, but a reprieve with a purpose.</p>
<p>那么，如果可能的话，撤退并躲到另一个地方。如果不可能的话，那么就发誓对你可能住在一起的人保持沉默，并撤退到你能找到的最安静的地方。利用这段时间，可能持续几天甚至几周——一种远离外部世界的假期，一种喘息，但是一种有目的的喘息。</p>
<p>For it is within your spiritual retreat that you must reconsider where you are and what you are doing, who you are with and what you are doing with them, to check to make sure that all these things are really correct and appropriate for you.</p>
<p>因为正是在你的精神撤退中，你必须重新考虑你在哪里、你在做什么、你和谁在一起以及你和他们一起做什么，以检查确保所有这些事情对你来说都是真正正确与合适的。</p>
<p>People do not check on these things. So they make decisions and try to adapt to their decisions and the outcomes of their decisions, forfeiting their ability to recognize the truth of their situation and suffering greatly as a result.</p>
<p>人们不会去核实这些事情。因此，他们做出决定，并试图适应他们的决定及其结果，从而丧失了认识其处境真理的能力，并因此遭受巨大的痛苦。</p>
<p>Endless confusion, endless negotiations with others, endless discord, endless anxiety, when in fact they were improperly engaged to begin with, and have now invested their time, their energy and their resources in an involvement that was never appropriate to begin with.</p>
<p>无尽的困惑、无尽的与他人的谈判、无尽的争吵、无尽的焦虑，而事实上他们从一开始就没有正当地参与其中，现在又将他们的时间、能量和资源投入到一件从一开始就不合适的事情上。</p>
<p>Where you live, who you live with, how you spend your time, what you concern yourself with and what you tell yourself are all critically important in determining not only what life will bring to you, but also what you will be able to see and know and do.</p>
<p>你住在哪里、和谁住在一起、如何度过时间、你关心什么以及你告诉你自己什么，所有这些都至关重要，因为它们不仅决定了生命会给你带来什么，还决定了你能够看到、知道和做什么。</p>
<p>So as the pressure builds, as the sense of discord and disassociation with yourself increases, it is time to take spiritual retreat. It will take a day or two just to become accustomed to being without all these other forms of stimulation. Your mind will be running along in its feverish overworked state, so it will take time to calm everything down.</p>
<p>因此，随着压力的增加，随着与你自己的不和谐感与分离感的增加，是时候进行精神上的休憩了。需要一两天的时间才能习惯没有所有这些其他形式的刺激。你的心灵已经处于狂热的过度劳累状态，因此需要时间来让一切平静下来。</p>
<p>Here it is wise to listen to the Voice of the New Message, to read the sacred books of Knowledge and to spend time listening within yourself for your deeper experience.</p>
<p>在这里，明智的做法是聆听新讯息的声音，阅读内识的神圣书籍，并花时间倾听你自己的内心以获得更深层次的体验。</p>
<p>Whatever you do here, it should be quiet and passive. You are not trying to get things. You are not trying to solve problems. You are not trying to have insights. You are not trying to get anywhere. You are simply slowing down to see if there are things that you need to know.</p>
<p>无论你在这里做什么，都应该保持安静和被动。你不是在试图得到东西。你不是在试图解决问题。你不是在试图获得洞察力。你不是在试图到达任何地方。你只是放慢速度，看看是否有你需要知道的事情。</p>
<p>Once your mind has quieted down sufficiently, then it is time to review recent decisions you have made. You ask yourself with each one that you can identify: “Was this a wise decision?” You ask this question only within the context of receiving a positive or a negative. You only have a few choices in the response: positive or negative; or weak positive or weak negative.</p>
<p>当你的心灵足够平静下来后，就该回顾一下你最近做出的决定了。对于每一个你能识别的决定，你都要问你自己：“这是一个明智的决定吗？”你问这个问题只是为了得到肯定或否定的回答。你只有几种选择：肯定或否定；或者微弱的肯定或微弱的否定。</p>
<p>If you are doubtful or apprehensive, then you should concern yourself with this question. For it is evidence of doubt; it is evidence of conflict and uncertainty. If you ask sincerely with a desire to know, then you will feel resonance with Knowledge.</p>
<p>如果你有疑虑或忧虑，那么你应该关注这个问题。因为它是怀疑的证据；它是冲突和不确定性的证据。如果你真诚地询问并渴望知道，那么你就会感受到与内识的共鸣。</p>
<p>If the answer is no, you must simply accept this without explanation, and be with this response and your own experience. If the answer is affirmative, then you will feel this simply as a quiet state within yourself. There is no conflict or issue here.</p>
<p>如果答案是否定的，你必须简单地接受这一点，无需解释，并接受这个回应和你自身的体验。如果答案是肯定的，那么你会感觉到这只是你内心的一种平静状态。这里没有冲突或问题。</p>
<p>Review your recent decisions. If you have made a mistake, then you can ask: “Must I do something different regarding this?” The answer will be yes or no. If the answer is affirmative, then you will have to consider how you will need to rectify this situation, and write down your thoughts and insights here.</p>
<p>回顾你最近的决定。如果你犯了错误，那么你可以问：“我必须就此做些不同的事情吗？”答案是肯定或否定。如果答案是肯定的，那么你将不得不考虑如何纠正这种情况，并在此写下你的思想和见解。</p>
<p>Next it is important to review your fundamental circumstances. Are you living in the right place? Yes or no. Are you with the right people? Yes or no. Is your form of work appropriate for you now at this time? Yes or no. Are your hobbies or other activities appropriate? Identify them each. Yes or no. Write down your responses. If there are things to reconsider, then ask yourself: “Is there something I need to do about this now?” Yes or no.</p>
<p>接下来，重要的是回顾一下你的基本情况。你住在正确的地方吗？是或否。你和正确的人在一起吗？是或否。你的工作形式现在适合你吗？是或否。你的爱好或其他活动合适吗？一一列举。是或否。写下你的回答。如果有事情需要重新考虑，那么问问你自己：“我现在需要做些什么吗？”是或否。</p>
<p>These questions can be very challenging. They may challenge your fundamental set of assumptions. They may challenge something that you have already invested yourself in. They may challenge your preferences and your desires. But what you are really doing here is being true to yourself, honest with yourself.</p>
<p>这些问题可能非常具有挑战性。它们可能会挑战你的基本假设。它们可能会挑战你已经投入的事物。它们可能会挑战你的偏好和愿望。但你在这里真正要做的是对你自己诚实。</p>
<p>Wanting something that is not right for you and committing yourself to having that is a form of dishonesty with yourself, a kind of betrayal. And you want to make sure in life that you are not betraying yourself or your deeper inclinations. For if you are, you are suffering, and you are losing life force, energy and time to a situation that cannot succeed, laying you open and vulnerable to further suffering and discord. Knowledge within you will seek to unburden you of these kinds of mistakes, which people so commonly commit, and the terrible waste that they create in a person’s life.</p>
<p>想要一些不适合你的东西并承诺拥有它是一种对你自己不诚实的形式，一种背叛。你要确保在生命中你没有背叛你自己或你更深层次的倾向。因为如果你这样做了，你就会受苦，你会在一个不可能成功的处境中浪费生命力、能量和时间，让你面临进一步的痛苦与不和。你内心的内识会努力让你摆脱这些人们经常犯的错误，以及它们在一个人的生命中造成的可怕浪费。</p>
<p>If a change must be made and you must take action now, then you may pose various things that you could do, but in the context of receiving a positive or a negative response. No explanations. Knowledge will guide you but not explain.</p>
<p>如果必须做出一种改变，你必须立即采取行动，那么你可以提出各种可以做的事情，但要考虑到收到正面或负面的回应。没有解释。内识会指导你，但不会解释。</p>
<p>But before you can seek resolution, you must see if you really have the heart and the intention to change the situation. Here you must be very honest with yourself. If you are not ready to make such a change, if it is a serious change in your life, then you must tell yourself this: “I am not ready”—without denying the truth of the situation, or trying to seek a compromise or make a deal. You may say: “I know I have to leave this relationship, but at this moment I am not ready.” That is honest in the moment, but it does not release you from your responsibility to take action regarding this.</p>
<p>但在你寻求解决方案之前，你必须看到你是否真的有心和意愿去改变这种情况。在这里你必须对你自己非常诚实。如果你还没有准备好做出这样的改变，如果这是你生命中的一次重大改变，那么你必须告诉你自己：“我还没有准备好”——不否认情况的真相，也不试图寻求妥协或达成协议。你可以说：“我知道我必须离开这段关系，但此刻我还没准备好。”这在当下是诚实的，但它并不能免除你对此采取行动的责任。</p>
<p>You will need to come back to these questions several times. Once is not enough. And if your intentions are honest and sincere, where you want to know the truth above all things, then Knowledge will be consistent. But you must understand you cannot make compromises with Knowledge. You cannot make a deal. You cannot say, “I will do a little of this, if you give me a little of that.”</p>
<p>你需要多次回顾这些问题。一次是不够的。如果你的意图是诚实和真诚的，你想知道真相高于一切，那么内识就会始终如一。但你必须明白，你不能与内识妥协。你不能做交易。你不能说，“如果你给我一点那个，我就做一点这个。”</p>
<p>There is no negotiating with the truth. You can either embrace it, or you run away from it. But it does not alter itself to meet your preferences. You must come to it on its terms and not on yours. It is this that will demonstrate to you that Knowledge is beyond the intellect and is not a product of your own creation or your own preferences. It is not a form of self-deception, but the ultimate form of self-correction.</p>
<p>真理是没有谈判余地的。你可以拥抱它，也可以逃避它。但它不会为了迎合你的喜好而改变它自己。你必须按照它的条件而不是你自己的条件来面对它。正是这一点将向你证明内识超越智力，不是你自身创造或你自身喜好的产物。它不是一种自我欺骗的形式，而是自我修正的终极形式。</p>
<p>During this questioning time, take periods of practicing stillness, which you can learn to do in the study of Steps to Knowledge. Stillness will enable you to feel the condition of your life and connect with your deeper experience. It will also teach you to focus your mind. It will teach you over time how to slip beneath the surface of the mind, where you live so much of the time in a state of confusion and uncertainty.</p>
<p>在这段质疑的时间里，花些时间练习静止，你可以在《内识进阶》的学习中学会静止。静止能让你感受到生命的状况，并与更深层次的体验相联系。它还会教你如何集中注意力。随着时间的推移，它会教你如何潜入心灵的表面之下，而你大部分时间都生活在困惑和不确定的状态中。</p>
<p>Here you are gaining a relationship with your inner life and building a pathway into it, step by step. Without the world constantly stimulating you and distracting you and giving you unnecessary things to consider, you actually can bring a great deal of focus to bear on these fundamental questions about your circumstances.</p>
<p>在这里，你正在与你的内在生命建立一种关系，并一步步建立一条通往内在生命的道路。没有世界不断地刺激你、分散你的注意力，也没有给你不必要的事情去考虑，你实际上可以把大量的注意力放在这些关于你处境的基本问题上。</p>
<p>If you are in the wrong place or with the wrong people or attempting inappropriate relationships or wasting your life force on things that have no future or real value, then nothing is going to really work out for you. Your conclusions will be wrong because your premises are incorrect. And the investment of time and resources and energy will be truly wasteful for you and for others.</p>
<p>如果你身处错误的地方，与错误的人在一起，或试图建立不合适的关系，或将生命力浪费在没有未来或真正价值的事情上，那么你什么都不会真正成功。你的结论会是错误的，因为你的前提是错误的。而你投入的时间、资源和能量对你和他人来说都是真正的浪费。</p>
<p>It is so important to be right with your life and with yourself. It produces a kind of satisfaction and deep equanimity that nothing else can produce. It restores to you your self-respect and your self-trust and confidence over time.</p>
<p>正确对待你的生命和你自己非常重要。它能带来一种其他事物无法带来的满足感和深度的平静。随着时间的推移，它会恢复你的自尊、你的自我信任和自信。</p>
<p>Take this time of retreat to listen to the Voice of the New Message, to hear the Messenger, to read the Books of Knowledge because it will refresh your mind and will remind you constantly that you have a greater Intelligence within you to guide and protect you and give you clarity when you really need it.</p>
<p>利用这次静修来聆听新讯息的声音，聆听信使，阅读内识的书籍，因为它将刷新你的心灵，并不断提醒你，你内心有更伟大的智能来指导你和保护你，并在你真正需要的时候给你清晰的认识。</p>
<p>During this time, you can practice gazing where you look at some object that has no significance and let your mind be still, just being present in that moment. This is so restful to the mind, for the mind needs great rest if it is to take on greater responsibilities and to serve you in your important endeavors.</p>
<p>在此期间，你可以练习凝视，凝视一些不重要的物体，让你的心灵静止，只存在于那一刻。这对心灵来说非常放松，因为心灵需要充分的休息，才能承担更伟大的责任，并为你的重要事业服务。</p>
<p>During your retreat, do not eat anything that is highly stimulating, or drink anything that is stimulating or that alters your condition, for you want to experience where you really are, how you really feel and what you really know.</p>
<p>在静修期间，不要吃任何高度刺激的食物，也不要喝任何刺激性或会改变你状况的饮料，因为你想要体验你真正所在的地方、你真正的感受以及你真正知道的内识。</p>
<p>Do not hide or protect anything here. Review as many things as you can, even small activities, to see if they are really serving you because every activity and every engagement in life is either giving you energy or taking it away. There are no neutral relationships. They are either meaningful and purposeful or they are not.</p>
<p>不要在这里隐藏或保护任何事物。回顾尽可能多的事情，即使是小活动，看看它们是否真的对你有用，因为生命中的每一项活动和每一项参与要么给你能量，要么夺走它。没有中立的关系。它们要么有意义和有目的，要么没有。</p>
<p>Even your hobbies and your pleasures should be providing for you reprieve and wholesome and healthy stimulation. You do not want to betray yourself any further by mindlessly engaging in things or involvements with people or significant relationships that have nowhere to go.</p>
<p>即使是你的爱好和乐趣也应该为你提供缓解和有益健康的刺激。你不想再通过无意识地参与无处可去的事情或与人交往或重要的关系来进一步背叛你自己。</p>
<p>One of the first things that a student of Knowledge must do is to stop losing energy, time and awareness to things that are not appropriate for them. That is why the evaluation must continue, it continues through the course of your spiritual retreat. And as you become more aware and more competent at this, it continues into your daily life.</p>
<p>内识学生必须做的第一件事之一就是停止浪费能量、时间和觉知在不适合他们的事情上。这就是为什么评估必须继续下去，它会在你的精神静修过程中继续下去。随着你在这方面变得更加有意识和更有能力，它会继续进入你的日常生命。</p>
<p>Here you are able to avoid mistakes before they happen. You are [able] to recognize inappropriate engagements before you engage with them. You are able to see and know before you act because you are bringing this care and this awareness to everything that life is bringing to you.</p>
<p>在这里，你能够在错误发生之前避免它们。你能够在参与之前识别不适当的活动。你能够在行动之前看到并知道，因为你将这种关心和觉知带到了生命带给你的一切事物中。</p>
<p>That is why the wise man or the wise woman is listening and watching a great deal. They are discerning the environment. They are discerning the intentions of other people. They are discerning their own communications to other people. They are feeling the Presence around them to see what it is conveying. They do not talk a great deal. They do not chatter a great deal. They are being present with the moment, present with people, present to the experience of love and affinity, present to the experience of discord and disharmony, present to whatever is there.</p>
<p>这就是为什么明智的男人或女人要多多倾听和观察。他们辨别环境。他们辨别其他人的意图。他们辨别他们自身与其他人之间的交流。他们感受周围的存在，看它传达了什么。他们不多说话。他们不多喋喋不休。他们活在当下，活在人们身边，活在爱与亲和力的体验中，活在不和与不和谐的体验中，活在一切存在中。</p>
<p>As you gain this skill over time, it will be ever more difficult for you to make a mistake. But you must take spiritual retreat to begin to gain these skills and abilities. They do not just happen instantaneously, and you do not already possess them to any significant degree. So they must be developed over time and through practice.</p>
<p>随着你逐渐掌握这项技能，你将越来越难以犯错。但你必须进行精神上的静修，才能开始获得这些技能和能力。它们不会瞬间出现，而且你还没有在很大程度上拥有它们。因此，它们必须随着时间的推移和实践来发展。</p>
<p>If your spiritual retreat is effective, you will begin to see how much you are missing in life, how much you are not present with yourself or with other people, how caught up you become in your desires or the events that you are involved in. And you will see how easy it is for you to make mistakes or misjudge situations or misinterpret other people’s intentions or activities regarding you. You learn here by contrast. For in a quieter, more perceptive state, you see the contrast between that and your normal activities.</p>
<p>如果你的精神静修有效，你就会开始看到你在生命中失去了多少东西，你有多少时间没有与你自己或他人相处，你有多沉迷于你的欲望或参与的事件。你会看到你是多么容易犯错误、误判情况或误解其他人对你的意图或活动。你在这里通过对比来学习。因为在更安静、更敏锐的状态下，你会看到这与你的正常活动之间的对比。</p>
<p>This contrast is essential because people do not know that they do not know. They are not aware that they are betraying themselves and accommodating themselves to situations that are extremely unhealthy for them. They do not know what they need to know. They do not know what it is to be quiet and observant. They do not know what it is to be able to still the mind and experience the vast Presence there. They are habitually involved in a set of activities and a state of mind that they know that nothing else exists. It is just how they are, or so they think.</p>
<p>这种对比是必要的，因为人们不知道他们不知道。他们没有察觉到他们正在背叛他们自己，并让他们自己适应对他们极其不利的情况。他们不知道他们需要知道什么。他们不知道什么是安静和观察。他们不知道什么是能够平静心灵并体验心灵中广阔的存在。他们习惯性地参与一系列活动和一种他们知道没有其他事物存在的心理状态。这就是他们现在的样子，或者他们是这么认为的。</p>
<p>They are addicted to things and do not even know it. They are making agreements that betray them and do not even know it. They are saying yes to things they should not agree to. And sometimes they say no to things that are truly beneficial. Yet how will they ever know this, caught up as they are, habitually engaged, if they do not take retreat?</p>
<p>他们沉迷于事物却浑然不知。他们不知不觉地做出了背叛自己的协议。他们答应了不该答应的事情。有时，他们还会拒绝真正有益的事情。然而，如果他们不退后，他们又怎么会知道这一点呢？他们已经习惯性地陷入其中。</p>
<p>The only way that they will be able to gain a greater self-awareness is through utter disappointment or personal loss. Or some kind of shock to their life that sets them back, forces them to rethink their situation and their decisions, their motives and their activities.</p>
<p>他们能够获得一种更大自我觉知的唯一方式是通过彻底的失望或个人损失。或者某种对他们生命的冲击，让他们倒退，迫使他们重新思考他们的处境和他们的决定、他们的动机和他们的活动。</p>
<p>But shock, loss and dismay— though [they] may be very effective at times—are a very costly way to learn wisdom. It is a very expensive way to gain clarity and wisdom about one’s actions and involvements in life. Why pay such a monumental price? Why let things deteriorate to such a great degree that you find yourself in crisis before you are willing to really consider the merits of your activities?</p>
<p>但震惊、失落和沮丧——尽管有时它们可​​能非常有效——是一种非常昂贵的学习智慧的方式。这是一种非常昂贵的方式，可以让你对自己的行为和生命中的所作所为有清晰的认识和智慧。为什么要付出如此巨大的代价？为什么要让事情恶化到如此严重的程度，以至于你发现你自己陷入了危机，而你才愿意真正考虑你的行为的价值？</p>
<p>If you will continue in this practice, you will begin to see what error is costing you. It is costing you your life, it is costing you your self-confidence, it is costing you your integrity, it is costing you the greater opportunities of relationships that are meant for you, but for which you are now unprepared.</p>
<p>如果你继续这样做，你就会开始看到错误让你付出了多大的代价。它让你失去了生命，让你失去了自信，让你失去了完整性，让你失去了本该属于你的、但你还没有准备好的更伟大的关系机会。</p>
<p>It is really costing you everything. But day in and day out, you call this normal and you adapt. You adapt to things that are really unsatisfactory, you adapt to relationships that are unfulfilling and which lack purpose and meaning. You adapt to a state of mind that is grudging and restrained, fearful and distrustful.</p>
<p>它确实让你付出了一切。但日复一日，你却认为这是正常的，并且适应了。你适应了那些真正不令人满意的事情，你适应了那些无法满足、缺乏目的和意义的关系。你适应了一种勉强和克制、恐惧和不信任的心灵状态。</p>
<p>Do not wait for a calamity to show you that you must stop. Do not wait for a serious accident or illness or personal loss to show you that you must stop to reconsider what you are doing.</p>
<p>不要等到灾难发生才意识到必须停下来。不要等到发生严重事故、患病或遭受个人损失才意识到必须停下来重新考虑你正在做的事情。</p>
<p>Spiritual retreat here is a great opportunity if you know how to use it, if you recognize your need for it, and if you are patient within it. Regarding major decisions in life, it can take time to come to terms with them because your mind will want to bargain and want to deny and want to be reasonable—all these things that people do to try to talk themselves out of their own experience, to try to make life give them what they want instead of show them what they really know.</p>
<p>如果你知道如何使用精神上的撤退，如果你认识到你对它的需要，如果你耐心等待，那么精神上的撤退就是一个绝佳的机会。关于生命中的重大决定，你可能需要花时间去接受它们，因为你的心灵会想要讨价还价，想要否定，想要通情达理——人们做所有这些事情是为了试图说服他们自己摆脱他们自身的体验，试图让生命给予他们想要的东西，而不是向他们展示他们真正知道的内识。</p>
<p>You have to keep coming back to Knowledge. It is not changeable like your personality. It does not vacillate like your desires. It does not change from day to day. It is stable, it is powerful, it is real, and you cannot change it. But it is these things that make it real and authentic and reliable—a source of wisdom, certainty and direction for you, the greatest source that you can have.</p>
<p>你必须不断回到内识。它不像你的人格那样易变。它不像你的欲望那样优柔寡断。它不会日复一日地改变。它是稳定的，它是强大的，它是真实的，你无法改变它。但正是这些事情让它变得真实、可信和可靠——它是你的智慧、确定性和方向的源泉，你能拥有的最伟大源泉。</p>
<p>You take spiritual retreat to take reprieve from the outer world, but more fundamentally you take spiritual retreat to come to Knowledge within yourself. You come to Knowledge not as some fantastic or euphoric experience, but you come to Knowledge to seek clarity, certainty and resolution.</p>
<p>你进行精神上的撤退是为了从外部世界获得喘息，但更根本的是，你进行精神上的撤退是为了获得你内心的内识。你获得内识并非为了获得某种奇妙或欣快的体验，你获得内识是为了寻求清晰性、确定性和决心。</p>
<p>For Knowledge’s first purpose is to unburden you, to clarify your life, to simplify your life, to clear a pathway for you, to liberate you from what cannot succeed, to empower you to become free of the pervasive influence of others, the demands and expectations of others.</p>
<p>因为内识的首要目的，是减轻你的负担，澄清你的生命，简化你的生命，为你扫清道路，把你从无法成功的事物中解放出来，赋予你力量，让你摆脱他人的普遍影响、他人的要求和期望。</p>
<p>Before Knowledge can set you on a higher course in life, it must free you from your current burdens. And it must teach you another way of thinking and being with life. It will teach this through dramatic contrast—the contrast between what you know and the experience of Knowledge, and your frantic pursuits and desires and fears.</p>
<p>在内识能够引导你走上生命更高道路之前，它必须让你摆脱你当前的负担。它必须教你另一种思维和对待生命的方式。它将通过戏剧性的对比来教导这一点——你所知道的和内识的体验之间的对比，以及你疯狂的追求、渴望和恐惧之间的对比。</p>
<p>Knowledge is quiet so much of the time. Take those things that you think you want and bring them to Knowledge. If Knowledge is not responding, it must not be so important, yes? If desire or purpose is not at the level of Knowledge, why are you giving yourself to this person or this thing or this acquisition with such passion? Why are you so captivated and swayed, delirious and intoxicated?</p>
<p>内识大部分时间都很安静。把那些你认为你想要的东西带给内识。如果内识没有回应，那它一定不是那么重要，对吗？如果欲望或目的不在内识的层面上，为什么你要如此热情地把你自己交给这个人、这个东西或这个收获？为什么你如此着迷、如此摇摆、如此神志恍惚、如此陶醉？</p>
<p>You come to Knowledge, and it is silent, waiting for you to become sober, creating a contrast that is necessary for you to see the difference between being seduced by something and being true to yourself. You will be shocked to find out how slavish you really are to your wishes and desires. You will be shocked to see how blind and unresponsive you have been to life and how much you have missed as a result. This can be shocking and discouraging to see the waste that you have created. But do not let this recognition stop you in following The Way of Knowledge. For you do not want to waste your life now. Your time is precious. Each day is precious.</p>
<p>你来到内识面前，内识沉默不语，等待你清醒过来，创造一种必要的对比，让你看到被某种东西诱惑和忠于你自己之间的区别。你会震惊地发现，你是多么地屈从于你的愿望和欲望。你会震惊地看到，你对生命是多么的盲目和冷漠，以及你因此错过了多少。看到你造成的浪费，这可能会令人震惊和沮丧。但不要让这种认识阻止你追随内识之路。因为你现在不想浪费你的生命。你的时间是宝贵的。每一天都是宝贵的。</p>
<p>What you practice is what you will reap. What you practice is what will become permanent. If you practice ignorance, prejudice, self-denial, they will become permanent for you. If you just adhere to your social conditioning or the influence of others, that will become permanent for you and ever more difficult to liberate yourself from in the future. The prison becomes more solid, its walls become thicker and its restraints more oppressive.</p>
<p>你所实践的，就是你所收获的。你所实践的，就是你所永恒的。如果你实践无知、偏见、自我否定，它们对你来说就是永恒的。如果你只是坚持你的社会条件或他人的影响，那对你来说就是永恒的，而且将来你更难摆脱它们。监狱会变得更加坚固，它的墙壁会变得更加厚重，它的束缚会更加压迫。</p>
<p>Within your spiritual retreat, it is also important to rest the mind and to treat the body well, not giving it things that are unhealthy, but treating it well—allowing it to recover its strength, allowing your mind to practice stillness and to gaze and to enjoy nature, to seek solitude, to recover from the bombardment of all the world’s stimulation, to be with your experience and continue to be with your experience, bringing your mind back from fantasy and distraction, recalling yourself: “What do I really feel in this moment?”</p>
<p>在精神静修中，让心灵休息并善待身体是重要的，不要给它不健康的东西，而是善待它——让它恢复力量，让你的心灵练习静止、凝视和享受大自然，寻求独处，从世界所有刺激的轰炸中恢复过来，与你的体验在一起并继续与你的体验在一起，让你的心灵从幻想和分心中回来，回想一下你自己：“此刻我真正的感受是什么？”</p>
<p>If you do not govern your mind, it will govern you. It will become chaotic and destructive, distracting, blind and ignorant. It has no wisdom. It is meant to serve you, not to govern you.</p>
<p>如果你不控制你的心灵，它就会控制你。它会变得混乱和破坏性，分散注意力，盲目和无知。它没有智慧。它是为了服务你，而不是控制你。</p>
<p>In your spiritual retreat, you have an opportunity to build this new relationship with your mind, a healthy relationship with your body, a commitment to listen within yourself when faced with decisions that are important and to be honest to the best of your ability with where you are and what you are doing. This work, and it is work, this work will restore to you your self-appreciation and your self-respect—things that are so easily eroded out in the world, eroded almost imperceptibly, day by day.</p>
<p>在你的精神静修中，你有机会与你的心灵建立这种新的关系，与你的身体建立健康的关系，在面临重要决定时承诺倾听你自己的内心，并尽可能诚实地面对你自己的处境和所做的事情。这项工作，它就是工作，这项工作将恢复你的自我欣赏和自尊——这些东西在世界上很容易被侵蚀，几乎在不知不觉中日复一日地被侵蚀。</p>
<p>Within your spiritual retreat, you may seek the guidance of a spiritual teacher, which could be appropriate if that teacher is a teacher of Knowledge and not simply a teacher of methods and ideas; a teacher who understands the deeper life; a teacher who will assist you in discovering and experiencing what you really feel and know about your circumstances.</p>
<p>在你的精神静修中，你可以寻求一位精神老师的指导，这可能是合适的，如果这位老师是一位内识的老师，而不仅仅是一位方法和想法的老师；一位理解更深层次生命的老师；一位将协助你发现和体验你对你的处境真实感受和知道的老师。</p>
<p>But even contact with a teacher during retreat should be very minimal and is sometimes not necessary at all. Your retreat is a withdrawal from influential people for the most part. You are seeking your own internal compass now. So you do not want strong influences impacting you at this time.</p>
<p>但即使在闭关期间与老师的联系也应该非常少，有时根本没有必要。你的闭关在很大程度上是远离有影响力的人。你现在正在寻找你自身的内在指南针。所以你不希望此时有强烈的影响影响你。</p>
<p>Do not make peace the purpose of your retreat. Peace will come to you naturally and substantially as you resolve the conflicts and the compromises of your life.</p>
<p>不要把和平作为你静修的目的。当你解决生命中的冲突和妥协时，和平就会自然而然地降临到你的生命。</p>
<p>Do not make happiness the purpose of your retreat or you will only seek pleasurable things, and will miss the great opportunity that you have to re-evaluate your life and circumstances and to gain a deeper and greater relationship with yourself.</p>
<p>不要把幸福作为你静修的目的，否则你只会寻求快乐的事物，并会错过重新评估你的生命和环境以及与你自己建立一种更深层次、更伟大关系的绝佳机会。</p>
<p>Do not treat retreat as a kind of vacation or holiday from your life. It is really a time to investigate your life and to become honest and clear about what you are doing and who you are with.</p>
<p>不要把静修当成生命中的一种休假或节日。它实际上是一个审视生命、诚实而清晰地了解你在做什么、和谁在一起的时间。</p>
<p>Do not use retreat to read lots of spiritual ideas from different traditions, for you need to clear your mind now, not fill it with new things.</p>
<p>不要使用静修的时间阅读大量来自不同传统的精神想法，因为你现在需要清空你的心灵，而不是用新的事物填充它。</p>
<p>Do not use your retreat to engage actively with other people, such as you might find at a retreat center, for you are taking retreat from people, to build a deeper connection within yourself.</p>
<p>不要使用你的静修时间与其他人积极交流，比如你可能会在静修中心找到的人，因为你正在远离人们，是为了在你自己内心建立一种更深层次的联接。</p>
<p>Do not use retreat to seek higher truths, but instead seek the deeper experience of Knowledge within yourself. This is not an intellectual pursuit. This is not academic research. This is not to build a high and lofty ideology or to fortify your philosophy. All those things must be questioned as well in your deep evaluation. If you are responding to your real needs, then you will understand these words that I am saying.</p>
<p>不要使用静修来寻求更高的真理，而是要寻求你内心更深层次的内识体验。这不是智力的追求。这不是学术研究。这不是为了建立一种高高在上的意识形态或巩固你的哲学。所有这些事情也必须在你的深度评估中受到质疑。如果你正在回应你真正的需求，那么你就会理解我所说的这些话。</p>
<p>If you are experiencing suffering in your life and seek its resolution and also seek to prevent it from reoccurring in your life, you must follow and listen to My words. If you know you are not living the life that you are meant to live, then you must withdraw to find out why and what you must do over time to resolve this. You do this also to build the strength and the confidence to take decisive action in your life, particularly as it may contradict or oppose the wishes and the will of others.</p>
<p>如果你在生命中遭遇痛苦，并寻求解决之道，同时寻求防止它在你的生命中再次发生，你必须遵循并听从我的话语。如果你知道你没有过上你应该过的生命，那么你必须退后一步，找出原因，以及随着时间的推移你必须做些什么来解决这个问题。你这样做也是为了建立力量和信心，在你的生命中采取果断行动，特别是因为它可能与他人的愿望和意志相矛盾或对立。</p>
<p>Let this be your time to build your relationship with Knowledge, which is your first and foremost priority in life, for it is Knowledge that represents God’s Presence in your life. This is the Wisdom God has given you to guide you and to protect you and to lead you to greater accomplishments here in the world.</p>
<p>让现在成为你建立与内识关系的时间，这是你生命中首要的优先事项，因为内识代表着上帝在你生命中的存在。这是上帝赋予你的智慧，用来指导你、保护你并引领你在这个世界上取得更伟大的成就。</p>
<p>Why would you seek anything else? But you must remember that Knowledge exists beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect. It represents a greater reality than the reality of your ideas, your theories, your beliefs, your philosophy and so forth.</p>
<p>你为什么要寻求其他东西呢？但你必须记住，内识存在于智力的领域和范围之外。它代表着一种比你的想法、你的理论、你的信仰、你的哲学等等的现实更伟大的现实。</p>
<p>There is a Calling for you in the world. But first you must prepare. You must prepare your life and with the assistance of Knowledge, you must clear a path. You must bring resolution to that which requires resolution. You must seek to separate yourself from that which requires you to do so. You must honor that which you must carry forward and learn to tell the difference between what is good from what only looks good, what is real from what you want, what is beneficial from what only promises to be beneficial.</p>
<p>这个世界有一个召唤。但首先你必须做好准备。你必须准备好你的生命，在内识的帮助下，你必须开辟一条道路。你必须为需要解决的事情带来解决。你必须寻求将你自己与需要你这样做的事情区分开来。你必须尊重你必须发扬的内识，并学会分辨什么是好的，什么是仅仅看起来好的，什么是真实的，什么是你想要的，什么是有益的，什么是仅仅承诺有益的。</p>
<p>It is only at the realm of deeper experience that you can make these distinctions, to have this discernment and to bring this discernment into your life every day. It is this that will save your life and your time and your energy. It is this that will open you to greater relationship with others and prepare you for the greater purpose that has brought you into the world—a greater purpose that is waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>只有在更深层次的体验领域，你才能够做出这些区分，拥有这种辨识力，并将这种辨别力带入你每天的生命中。正是内识将拯救你的生命、你的时间和你的能量。正是内识将使你敞开与他人的更伟大关系，并为实现把你带到这个世界上的更伟大目的做好准备——这个更伟大的目的正等待着你去发现。</p>
