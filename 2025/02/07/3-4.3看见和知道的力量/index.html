<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on December 30, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 12 月 30 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many things that people do not see that cause great havoc in their lives. At any given moment, things are coming over the horizon, both for you individually and for everyone. Not seeing these things creates great turbulence and upheaval in so many different situations—not seeing a radical event in a nation’s economy, not foreseeing the changing circumstances of one’s life, not foreseeing the end of one’s employment, not foreseeing a grave problem in one’s relationship, not seeing a remarkably important opportunity that may only come to you once in a great long while. So much is missed because people are preoccupied. Their minds are full of thoughts and concerns, fantasies and anxieties. So events happen, but they do not see.</p>
<p>有许多人们看不到的事情都会给他们的生命带来巨大的灾难。无论是对你个人还是对所有人来说，任何时候都会有一些事情在地平线上出现。看不到这些事情会在许多不同的情况下造成巨大的动荡和混乱——看不到一个国家经济中的重大事件，看不到一个人生命环境的变化，看不到一个人失业，看不到一个人关系中的严重问题，看不到一个可能很久才会出现一次的非常重要的机会。人们因为心不在焉而错过了许多事情。他们的心灵中充满了思想和担忧、幻想和焦虑。所以事情发生了，但他们却没有看到。</p>
<p>The world is giving you signs about what is coming, giving you clues as to what to expect in your environment, in your nation, in your economy and in the more immediate circumstances of your life. Knowledge, the deeper Intelligence within you, is also giving you signs, clues and warnings. But you cannot hear Knowledge if your mind is preoccupied, if you are busy all the time, racing about with your busy schedule and all of your activities.</p>
<p>世界正在向你发出迹象，告诉你即将发生的变革巨浪，向你提供线索，告诉你在你的环境、你的国家、你的经济以及你的生命中更直接的情况会发生的事情。内识，你内在的更深层次的智能，也在向你发出迹象、线索和警告。但是，如果你的心灵被占据，如果你一直忙碌于繁忙的日程和各种活动，你就无法听到内识的声音。</p>
<p>You might feel certain things. You might have sensations of concern or anxiety. You might have profound and lucid dreams at night. But if you do not give these your attention—to consider them, to investigate them, to ask questions concerning them—then the whole value of your inner guidance is being lost upon you.</p>
<p>你可能会感觉到某些事情。你可能会有担忧或焦虑的感觉。你可能会在晚上做深刻而清醒的梦。但如果你不关注这些——去考虑它们、去研究它们、去问有关它们的问题——那么你内在指导的全部价值就会消失。</p>
<p>There is so much hastiness in how people live. And the more successful they are by the world’s terms, the more hasty they are and the more they are missing. Not only are they missing the signs and the clues and the warnings from both the world on the outside and from Knowledge on the inside, but they are missing all of the enjoyments of life—the recognition of beautiful things, the appreciation of their circumstances, the magnificence of the world, the beauty and complexity of nature.</p>
<p>人们的生活方式太过于匆忙。按照世界的标准，他们越成功，就越匆忙，失去的也就越多。他们不仅错过了来自外部世界和内部内识的迹象、线索和警告，而且错过了生命的所有乐趣——对美好事物的认知、对环境的欣赏、世界的壮丽、大自然的美丽和复杂性。</p>
<p>Indeed, any one moment, anywhere, under almost any circumstances can provide a remarkable insight. The moment when this insight arises can be any moment. It can arise under any circumstances.</p>
<p>事实上，在任何时刻、任何地点、几乎任何情况下，都可以产生非凡的洞察力。这种洞察力产生的时刻可以是任何时刻。它可以在任何情况下产生。</p>
<p>But if people are not paying attention, if people are not responding, if they are not able to respond—able to be responsible—then it is like nothing has happened at all in their own experience even though a great deal is being revealed to them as they go along.</p>
<p>但如果人们不去关注，如果人们不去回应，如果他们不能回应——不能负责任——那么就好像在他们自身的体验中什么都没有发生过，尽管随着他们的前进，许多事情都会被揭示给他们。</p>
<p>So how is it possible that you could see these things that so many other people do not see, feel and know? How can seeing be achieved for your benefit and for the benefit of those who will be the recipients of your greater gifts in life?</p>
<p>因此，你如何有可能看到这些其他人看不到、感觉不到和不知道的事情呢？如何才能实现这种看到以造福于你，并造福于那些将接受你生命中更伟大礼物的人呢？</p>
<p>To see, you first must look and have looking be a part of your normal activities in life. Perhaps at the outset to create a different kind of experience and to begin to build the habit of looking, you will set aside special times of practice where you gaze out at the world without evaluation, without judgment, without being caught up in the past or the future—just listening and just being present.</p>
<p>要看，你首先必须观察，并让观察成为你日常生命的一部分。也许一开始，为了创造一种不同的体验，并开始养成观察的习惯，你会留出专门的练习时间，在这段时间里，你凝视着这个世界，不做评价，不做判断，不被过去或未来所困扰——只是倾听，只是活在当下。</p>
<p>Perhaps you will only be able to do this for a few moments at the outset. But as you practice this and make it part of your practice in meditation, then you will be able to listen more deeply and for longer periods of time. Here you are not trying to get anything, have anything, fix anything or resolve anything. You are just being there.</p>
<p>一开始，你也许只能坚持片刻。但随着你不断练习，并使其成为冥想练习的一部分，你将能够更深入、更长时间地倾听。在这里，你不会试图得到任何东西、拥有任何东西、修复任何东西或解决任何事情。你只是在那里。</p>
<p>There are so many opportunities to do this even while you are out in the world—whenever you are waiting in line for something, whenever you are sitting on a bus, whenever you are sitting in a chair waiting for something—to stop and just listen for a few moments. When you are with another, it is important to clear your mind and to just listen to them, for what they are really communicating is rarely contained in their words alone.</p>
<p>即使在外面的世界，也有许多机会可以做到这一点——无论何时你在排队等候，无论何时你坐在公交车上，无论何时你坐在椅子上等待着什么——停下来，倾听片刻。当你与他人在一起时，重要的是要清空你的心灵，只是倾听他们，因为他们真正传达的信息很少只包含在他们的言语中。</p>
<p>This ability to be still and to be with people, with places and with things is so fundamentally necessary to gain access to the deeper Intelligence within you, the Intelligence of Knowledge, which will reveal things to you in the moment you would never see, hear or feel otherwise. It is this ability to listen both without and within, in the moment, that gives you this great advantage.</p>
<p>这种保持平静并与人、与地方、与事物相处的能力对于获得你内在更深层次的智能，即内识的智能是如此根本必要，它将在那一刻向你揭示你永远无法看见、听到或感受到的事情。正是这种在此刻内在和外在倾听的能力，给你带来了这个伟大优势。</p>
<p>This is so very important in your relationships because it allows a deeper discernment to come into play. It allows a deeper recognition to occur. People will tell you so much about themselves if you can really listen to them without judgment, without evaluation, without projecting all of your criteria upon them.</p>
<p>这在你的关系中是非常重要的，因为它可以让更深层次的辨别力发挥作用。它可以让更深层次的认知发生。如果你能真正倾听他们，没有判断，没有评估，不把你的所有标准都投射到他们身上，他们就会告诉你很多关于他们自己的事情。</p>
<p>But as you will see, as you look about, that people are so busy talking and thinking they are hardly present with anything, let alone themselves. And so they do not see and they do not hear and they do not know where they are, what they are doing or who they are with. It is incredible that a human being who is equipped with such magnificent capabilities would not be using them to their fullest advantage.</p>
<p>但是，当你环顾四周，你就会发现，人们都在忙着说话和思考，他们几乎不与任何事物在一起，更不用说他们自己了。因此，他们看不见，听不见，不知道他们在哪里，在做什么，和谁在一起。令人难以置信的是，一个拥有如此非凡能力的人竟然没有充分使用这些能力。</p>
<p>If you listen to another, they can tell you so much about themselves, and it will inform you as to how to be with them appropriately. Here you are not being seduced by beauty, wealth or charm. You are just listening. You are listening respectfully, without condemnation. You are listening to hear if there is anything you need to know about this person or about your being with this person. This again allows a deeper evaluation to naturally take place as Knowledge, the deeper Intelligence within you, can speak to you or give you indications or signs.</p>
<p>如果你去倾听另一个人，他们会告诉你很多关于他们自己的事情，也会告诉你如何与他们相处才是最合适的。在这里，你不会被美貌、财富或魅力所诱惑。你只是在倾听。你是在恭敬地倾听，而不是谴责。你在倾听，倾听关于这个人或关于你与这个人的相处，你是否有什么需要知道的。这又会允许你自然而然地进行更深层次的评估，因为内识，你内在更深层次的智能，可以对你说话或给你指示或迹象。</p>
<p>As you look at the birds and the animals, they are always listening and watching because the environment is always changing, and their security is never really fully established. People have lost this great and significant ability because they assume so many things about their safety and security and well-being. They do not want to be afraid. They do not want to feel anxiety and so they just shut everything out, when in fact being still and observant has nothing to do with fear. In fact, it is the antidote to fear.</p>
<p>当你观察鸟类和动物时，它们总是在倾听和观察，因为环境总是在变化，而它们的安全感从未真正完全建立起来。人们已经失去了这种伟大而显著的能力，因为人们对他们的安全和幸福抱有太多的幻想。他们不想害怕。他们不想感到焦虑，所以他们把一切都拒之门外，而事实上，保持安静和观察与恐惧无关。事实上，它是恐惧的解药。</p>
<p>You cannot be fearful and still all at once. You cannot be entertaining your own fearful imagination and be present to your environment at the same time. If the animals can do this with their far more limited intellectual and mental abilities, then certainly human beings can do this as well.</p>
<p>你不可能同时感到恐惧和平静。你不可能一边沉浸在你自身恐惧的想象中，一边又能融入周围的环境。如果动物能用它们有限的智力和心理能力做到这一点，那么人类肯定也能做到这一点。</p>
<p>Whenever you are about to make a mistake, particularly a serious mistake, there are signs and indicators. But if you are not paying attention, you miss the signs and the indicators. Then you run into a great problem, even a disaster.</p>
<p>当你即将犯错，尤其是犯严重的错误时，总会有迹象和指标。但如果你不注意，你就会错过这些迹象和指标。然后你就会遇到大的问题，甚至是灾难。</p>
<p>The vast majority of people’s critical errors are the result of their not paying attention to what they are doing, to where they are, to what is happening. As a result, they cannot receive the clues that are indicating a danger or a problem coming over the horizon.</p>
<p>大多数人犯严重错误都是因为他们没有注意他们在做什么、在哪里以及发生了什么。因此，他们无法收到危险或问题即将来临的线索。</p>
<p>Whenever you feel an unreasonable anxiety, it is important to become still and ask yourself: “What is this I am experiencing?” Listen deeply within yourself to see if there is any insight here for you.</p>
<p>每当你感到莫名的焦虑时，重要的是保持冷静并问你自己：“我正在经历的是什么？”深深地倾听你自己的内心，看看是否能给你带来一些洞察力。</p>
<p>In order for you to be wise and observant, you must develop these abilities and engage with these practices, not just once in a while when faced with a difficult problem, but as a part of your daily experience. If you can learn how to brush your teeth, you can learn how to listen to the world. If you can learn how to drive an automobile, you can learn to listen to another. It is preparation. It is habit. It is something you use and rely upon. And after a while, you do not even need to think about it.</p>
<p>为了让你变得明智和善于观察，你必须培养这些能力并参与这些实践，而不是偶尔在遇到难题时才这样做，而是将其作为日常经验的一部分。如果你能学会如何刷牙，你就能学会如何倾听世界。如果你能学会如何开车，你就能学会倾听他人。这是准备。这是习惯。它是你使用和依赖的东西。一段时间后，你甚至不需要再去想它了。</p>
<p>In the study of Steps to Knowledge, the great Book of Practices, it asks you to be still upon the hour, to listen to where you are and to regain a moment of contact with Knowledge within yourself. When people practice this particular hourly practice, they are amazed to see how hours and hours can pass by and they forget. They forgot to stop and to listen and to look.</p>
<p>在学习《内识进阶》这本伟大的实践之书时，它要求你时刻保持安静，倾听你身在何处，重新与你自己内在的内识取得联系。当人们进行这种特殊的每小时练习时，他们会惊讶地发现时间一分一秒地流逝，他们却忘了时间。他们忘记了停下来倾听和观察。</p>
<p>In doing this, they begin to see the extent to which they are not present to themselves or other people. They are not observing their environment carefully. They are just swept up in the activities of the day or in conversation or in imagination. During that time they were caught up, they had no idea what was going on within themselves or around them.</p>
<p>在这样做的过程中，他们开始意识到他们在多大程度上没有活在他们自己或他人面前。他们没有仔细观察周围的环境。他们只是沉浸在日常活动、谈话或想象之中。在这段时间里，他们沉浸其中，对他们自己和周围发生的事情一无所知。</p>
<p>Here you can begin to wonder why people experience such catastrophic events or make decisions that are so clearly not in their best interests or give away their life and their freedom to relationships that have no future or promise. How can such an intelligent individual do activities and make decisions that demonstrate so little intelligence?</p>
<p>在这里，你可能会开始疑惑，为什么人们会经历如此灾难性的事件，做出如此明显不符合他们最佳利益的决定，或者将他们的生命和他们的自由交给没有未来或承诺的关系。如此聪明的人怎么会做出如此缺乏智能的行为和决定呢？</p>
<p>Part of the answer to this is revealed in the ability or the inability to see, to hear and to know. Nature has given you powerful abilities in this regard. Perhaps your very distant ancestors used them to a far greater degree as they were much more challenged by their environment and the needs for survival. Perhaps you do not face such challenges, of course, but your need to discern where you are, what you are doing and what is happening around you is even greater today than it was long ago.</p>
<p>部分答案在于看见、听见和知道的能力。大自然赋予了你这方面的强大能力。也许你遥远的祖先在更大程度上运用了这些能力，因为他们面临着环境和生存需求的更大挑战。当然，你或许不再面临这样的挑战，但如今你对你在哪里、你在做什么以及你周围发生之事的洞察需求，比过去任何时候都更为迫切。</p>
<p>There are many more risks, many more decisions and many more aspects of life that you must now keep track of. Terrible relationship decisions as well as terrible business decisions or investment decisions or purchasing decisions all arise out of this failure to pay attention to your own experience and to your changing environment.</p>
<p>现在你必须关注更多的风险、更多的决定和更多的生命方面。糟糕的人际关系决定以及糟糕的商业决定、投资决定或购买决定都源于你未能关注你自身的体验和不断变化的环境。</p>
<p>What you want to achieve, particularly when you are interacting with other people, is to listen on the outside and the inside all at once. You can learn to do this while you are carrying on conversations or engaged in busy activities. This, however, requires some basic preparation: the ability to sit still, to listen and to look; the ability to discern the difference between what your mind might tell you and a real insight coming from a much deeper place within you.</p>
<p>在与他人互动时，你想要达成目标，尤其重要的一点，是同时倾听外在与内在的声音。你可以在交谈或忙碌的活动中学习做到这一点。然而，这需要一些基本的准备：静坐、倾听和观察的能力；能够分辨出你的心灵可能告诉你的信息和来自你内心深处的真正洞察力之间区别的能力。</p>
<p>Many people do not know how to distinguish the presence and the power of Knowledge from their own thinking and ideas because they have never gotten beneath the surface of their mind. They are so used to telling themselves things and having other people tell them things that they have not yet built the discernment necessary to distinguish an idea from a much deeper and significant insight.</p>
<p>许多人不知道如何区分内识的存在和力量与他们自身的思维和想法，因为他们从未深入过他们心灵的表面之下。他们已经习惯于告诉他们自己一些事情，也习惯于让其他人告诉他们一些事情，以至于他们还没有建立起必要的辨别力，来区分一个想法和一种更深层次、更重要的洞见。</p>
<p>But these are skills to be learned. These are habits to be established. Anyone can learn these things if they have the intention to do so. Anyone can make great progress here if they engage in a preparation not of their own making that has been provided for them to enhance these abilities and to call them forth.</p>
<p>但这些都是需要学习的技能。这些都是需要养成的习惯。只要有意愿，任何人都可以学习这些技能。任何人都可以在这里取得巨大进步，只要他们参与到一项不是他们自己做的准备中，这项准备已经为他们提供了，以增强这些能力并激发它们。</p>
<p>Seeing is a product of listening and paying attention. It is the product of looking at events without projecting your own answers or evaluations. It requires the ability to see beyond your own preferences and, in so many cases, beyond the consensus of those people who influence you.</p>
<p>看见是倾听和关注的产物。看见是在不投射你自身的答案或评价的情况下看待事件的结果。看见需要超越你自身的偏好，在许多情况下，超越那些影响你的人的共识。</p>
<p>This independent thinking, this ability to think freely, is actually much more rare than you might realize. Perhaps you have noticed that people within the same group or association with others will have the same comments, the same answers, the same evaluations and the same prejudices. No one is thinking independently. People are relying upon their social conditioning and the consensus of others or, in some cases, reliance upon certain authority figures in order to tell them what to think, to see, to know and to do. Though they are politically free, perhaps in a free nation, they are really not free to think for themselves. No one has revealed to them that Knowledge lives within them. No one has shown them a way to still the mind and to gain the power of vision.</p>
<p>这种独立思考，这种自由思考的能力，实际上比你可能意识到的要罕见得多。或许你注意到，同一个群体或协会中的人会拥有相同的评论、相同的答案、相同的评估和相同的偏见。没有人独立思考。人们依赖于他们的社会条件和他人的共识，或者在某些情况下，依赖于某些权威人物来告诉他们该想什么、看什么、知道什么和做什么。尽管他们在政治上是自由的，或许生活在一个自由的国家，但他们实际上无法自由地为他们自己思考。没有人向他们揭示内识就生活在他们的内心。没有人向他们展示一种平静的心灵和获得远见力量的方法。</p>
<p>If you can see that so many of humanity’s mistakes, both individually and collectively, are the product of not looking, seeing and recognizing a situation, then you can begin to see the immense value of developing these skills.</p>
<p>如果你可以看到，人类的许多错误，无论是个人错误还是集体错误，都是因为没有观察、看清和认识情况而造成的，那么你就可以开始看到培养这些技能的巨大价值。</p>
<p>With these skills, you will not make a mistake in relationships. With these skills, you will be unlikely to make a mistake in your business decisions. With these skills, you will be able to see long range what is coming for humanity as a whole and to prepare your life and your circumstances for these eventualities.</p>
<p>有了这些技能，你就不会在关系上犯错误。有了这些技能，你就不会在商业决策上犯错误。有了这些技能，你将能够长远地预见整个人类的未来，并为这些可能发生的情况做好准备。</p>
<p>Here dates and times are not important. It is the movement of things that is important. The date in which an event might occur cannot be your emphasis because the future is always shifting and changing. It is constantly being influenced by events in the present and to a certain extent events in the past.</p>
<p>在这里日期和时间并不重要。重要的是事物的运动。事件可能发生的日期不能成为你的重点，因为未来总是在变化。它不断受到当前事件的影响，在一定程度上也受到过去事件的影响。</p>
<p>You might know that a great earthquake is coming to your city. Perhaps you live in a city that is earthquake prone. But the date and the time will be very difficult and, in some cases, impossible to determine. But before that earthquake occurs, you will begin to have signs and signals within yourself and perhaps from the world around you. As the event approaches, these signs can help you to position yourself safely.</p>
<p>你可能知道一场大地震即将袭击你的城市。也许你住在一个地震多发的城市。但日期和时间将非常难以确定，在某些情况下甚至无法确定。但在地震发生之前，你会开始在你自己内心，甚至可能从你周围的世界中，感受到迹象和信号。随着地震的临近，这些迹象可以帮助你找到安全的位置。</p>
<p>Here you cannot be rational and reasonable according to what everyone else believes or assumes. Allowing yourself to be guided by Knowledge, a deeper Intelligence within you, is the key here. When it comes to taking action, Knowledge will guide you.</p>
<p>在这里，你不能根据其他人的信念或假设来保持理性和通情达理。允许你自己被内识，一种更深层次的智能所引导是关键。当你采取行动时，内识会指导你。</p>
<p>Knowledge is beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect. It is a very different kind of Intelligence within you. It does not compare and contrast, debate and discuss. It is not driven by greed and fear. It is not obsessed with the fear of loss. It is not afraid of the world. It is powerful. It is here on a mission. It holds your greater purpose for coming into the world, something your intellect cannot discern.</p>
<p>内识超越智力的领域和范围。它是你内在的一种非常不同的智能。它不比较和对比，不辩论和讨论。它不受贪婪和恐惧的驱使。它不沉迷于对失去的恐惧。它不惧怕世界。它是强大的。它在这里肩负着使命。它承载着你来到这个世界的更伟大目的，这是你的智力无法辨别的。</p>
<p>Knowledge is aroused by very important things, not insignificant things. But to learn how to respond to Knowledge and to recognize Knowledge in your own experience, you must take the Steps to Knowledge and develop your discernment and your awareness and alter certain patterns of your thinking that deny you the access to God’s greatest gift and endowment to you.</p>
<p>内识是由非常重要的事情所激发的，而非无关紧要的事情所激发的。但为了学习如何回应内识并在你自身的体验中认识内识，你必须开展内识的进阶，发展你的辨别力和你的觉知，并改变你的某些思维模式，这些思维模式让你无法接触到上帝赐予你的最伟大礼物和禀赋。</p>
<p>Knowledge is the Intelligence you had before you came into the world, and it will be the Intelligence you have after you leave the world. It is not governed by the world. It is not manipulated and seduced by the world. It is not confused by the world. It is not threatened by the world. And so it has no condemnation. It has no hatred, no enmity.</p>
<p>内识是你来到这个世界之前所拥有的智能，也是你离开这个世界之后所拥有的智能。它不受这个世界的支配。它不受这个世界的操纵和诱惑。它不受这个世界的迷惑。它不受这个世界的威胁。因此，它没有谴责。它没有仇恨，没有敌意。</p>
<p>Its concern is for you to discover and to express your greater purpose for being in the world. In that alone, it has a concern. It also has a concern for keeping you alive, keeping you healthy, keeping you safe, keeping you from destroying your life or giving your life away to things that have no promise and no real value. In this, it exerts a powerful and continuous influence.</p>
<p>它关心的是让你发现并表达你身处世界的更伟大目的。仅就这一点而言，它就有关心。它还关心让你活着，让你健康，让你安全，让你不毁掉你的生命或把你的生命交给没有承诺和没有真正价值的事物。在这方面，它发挥着强大而持续的影响力。</p>
<p>That is why every time you are about to make a real mistake, you will feel a kind of deep hesitation within yourself, as if your heart is freezing up, your stomach is clenching, something inside of you is saying, “Stop, wait, hold back, do not proceed,” like the sign on the highway that says: “Wrong way. Do not enter.” You will have this feeling within your mind and body.</p>
<p>这就是为什么每次你真的要犯错误的时候，你内心都会有一种深深的犹豫，好像你的心在冻结，你的胃在紧缩，你的内心在说：“停下，等待，回来，不要继续前行”，就像高速公路上的路牌上写着：“错误的道路，不要进入。”你的身心都会有这种感觉。</p>
<p>This is Knowledge telling you to stop. You are about to do something that will have very negative consequences for you. People on their marriage day have felt this restraint and yet at that point, with everyone gathered, they could not bow out.</p>
<p>这是内识在告诉你停下来。你即将做的事会给你带来非常负面的后果。人们在结婚那天感受到了这种束缚，但在那时，当所有人都聚集在一起时，他们无法退出。</p>
<p>As you become more aware of your own experience and the forces within you, you will begin to see the power of this restraint and its essential importance to your well-being and to your future. It is this voice, this presence, this power, this influence that will hold you back from a disastrous event. Even an event that would just cause you pain or suffering unnecessarily, it will exert an influence.</p>
<p>随着你对你自身的体验和内在力量的察觉不断加深，你将开始看到这种克制的力量，以及它对你的幸福和未来至关重要。正是这种声音、这种存在、这种力量、这种影响力将阻止你遭遇灾难性事件。即使是一个只会给你带来不必要的痛苦或折磨的事件，也会对你产生影响。</p>
<p>Here you must be willing to listen and to respond without trying to understand what it means because in most cases understanding will come later, after the fact. Here you must have the ability to act abruptly, even irrationally, in the evaluation of others—to stop yourself, if you are in the wrong place with the wrong people, to get up and leave. If you are about to do something that is against your deeper nature, you stop, you refuse to proceed, you refuse to go along with the others. You have the strength and the courage to do this.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须愿意聆听和回应，而不试图理解它意味着什么，因为在大多数情况下，理解会在之后、事后到来。在这里，你必须有能力在评估他人时采取果断的行动，甚至非理性的行动——如果你身处错误的地点，与错误的人在一起，那么你就必须停下来，站起身离开。如果你即将做某件违背你更深层次自然的事情，那么你就必须停下来，你拒绝继续，你拒绝与他人同行。你有实力和勇气做到这一点。</p>
<p>This is what breaks addictions. This is what overcomes compulsions. This is what breaks the chains of old habits. This is what liberates you from innumerable forms of domination, whether they are being imposed by others or whether they are imposed within your own mind.</p>
<p>这就是打破成瘾的方法。这就是克服强迫症的方法。这就是打破旧习惯枷锁的方法。这就是将你从无数种控制形式中解放出来的方法，无论这些控制形式是他人强加的，还是你自身心灵强加的。</p>
<p>Whatever your difficulty or challenge, Knowledge will lead you out of it, and will lead you out of it in such a way that you will gain from it, that you will gain wisdom, skill and self-confidence. In facing big problems, difficult problems, it becomes a path of many steps requiring many different decisions. Here you cannot figure out what to do all at once. You will have to follow a series of steps. And you will have to have the faith and confidence that this is indeed the way you must travel, even in the face of grave self-doubt.</p>
<p>无论你面临什么样的困难或挑战，内识都会带领你走出困境，在带领的过程中，使你从中获益，获得智慧、技能和自信。在面临大的问题、困难的问题时，它会变成一条需要做出许多不同决定的多重步骤之路。在这里，你无法一下子弄清楚该做什么。你必须遵循一系列步骤。你必须有对内识的信仰和信心，即使面对严重的自我怀疑，也要确信这是你必须走的路。</p>
<p>Here your relationships become very significant, for there are no neutral relationships in your life. Every relationship is either helping you or hindering you in developing these deeper skills and awareness. Even people in your life who seem to be wonderful and very loving can discourage you, for they themselves have never developed these skills and do not understand them and their importance.</p>
<p>在这里，你的关系变得非常重要，因为你的生命中不存在中立的关系。每一种关系要么帮助你，要么阻碍你发展这些更深层次的技能和觉知。即便是你生命中那些看似美好、充满爱心的人，也可能让你气馁，因为他们自己从未发展过这些技能，也不理解它们及其重要性。</p>
<p>Even if you have one ally who can support you in taking the Steps to Knowledge, who can support you in acting with integrity and in not betraying yourself in your actions and in your decision making, that is so very valuable. One ally in this way is worth a thousand friends. If you can join with another student of Knowledge, then you will gain strength from them, and they will gain strength from you. If you have such a relationship, you will see how extremely important it is to you and how much more you gain from this interaction than from all your other social engagements.</p>
<p>即使你只有一个盟友，能够支持你迈向内识的进阶，能够支持你完整性的行动，不在你的行为和决策中背叛你自己，那也是非常宝贵的。一个盟友胜过一千个朋友。如果你能与另一位内识学生联合，那么你将从他们那里获得力量，他们也将从你这里获得力量。如果你有这样的关系，你会看到它对你来说有多么重要，你从这种互动中获得的收获比你从所有其他社交活动中获得的收获多得多。</p>
<p>Sometimes you will need another to tell you what you yourself already know. But in the end it is the decision within you that you must make. The wisdom of this decision will be based upon what you see, hear and know.</p>
<p>有时你需要另一个人来告诉你，你自己已经知道的事情。但最终你必须自己做出决定。这个决定的智慧将基于你所看到、听到和知道的内识。</p>
<p>Learning to be still, learning to listen, learning to look without judgment—gaining this degree of control over your mind and your emotions and your affairs is fundamental to your ability to gain this deeper wisdom and these greater abilities. You do this because you practice, for this requires practice.</p>
<p>学会静心，学会聆听，学会不加评判地观察——获得对你的心灵、你的情感和你的事务的这种程度的控制，是你获得这种更深层次的智慧和这些更伟大能力的基础。你这样做是因为你练习，因为这需要练习。</p>
<p>You have spent your whole life practicing things perhaps that are not working for you, that are holding you back, that are destroying your discernment and are undermining your courage and your integrity. Now you must practice something to undo these things and to replace them.</p>
<p>你一生都在实践一些对你无益的事情，它们阻碍了你，摧毁了你的辨别力，削弱了你的勇气和完整性。现在你必须实践一些东西来消除这些事情并取而代之。</p>
<p>You do not all of a sudden wake up one day able to do all of these things. You learn to do them because you are practicing them, you are focusing on them. And you are focusing on them because you recognize their real importance to you, for you do not want to make the same mistakes over again. The only assurance that you will not make these mistakes is to gain the skills that are being presented here.</p>
<p>你不会突然有一天醒来就能做到所有这些事情。你学会做这些事情是因为你在练习它们，你在关注它们。你关注它们是因为你认识到它们对你真正的重要性，因为你不想再犯同样的错误。唯一能保证你不会犯这些错误的方法就是获得这里介绍的技能。</p>
<p>Life will give you opportunities to learn and to make wise decisions. And you have everyone around you, everyone, who is demonstrating the importance and the need for Knowledge. For everyone around you is making every form of mistake, every form of self-violation, basing their decisions upon acquiescence to others, or upon a consensus or upon their own social conditioning, unaware that they are acting slavishly by doing these things.</p>
<p>生命会给你机会去学习和做出明智的决定。你周围的每个人都在展示内识的重要性和必要性。因为你周围的每个人都在犯各种形式的错误，各种形式的自我违背，他们的决定是基于对他人的默许，或是基于共识，或是基于他们自己的社会条件，没有察觉到他们这样做是在奴性行事。</p>
<p>Instead of condemning other people for their mistakes and their foolishness, you could be in a position to gain wisdom from them, without demeaning them in any way. Here you are gaining the maximum value from everyone’s experience. And here you will discover that everyone’s experience is either reinforcing or denying the power and the presence of Knowledge within people.</p>
<p>你不必谴责他人的错误和愚蠢，而是可以从他们身上获得智慧，而不会以任何方式贬低他们。在这里，你从每个人的经验中获得了最大的价值。在这里，你会发现每个人的经验要么在加强，要么在否定人们内在内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>There are no neutral relationships. People are either encouraging you or discouraging you from finding the source of your own guidance and power. Perhaps they do not intend to be discouraging, but by their very nature and emphasis they can be holding you back. They know you as a friend. They do not know you as a person who is in the world seeking to find their greater purpose and mission here. They perhaps associate you with pleasant activities or shared interests and may have no sense at all of your deeper nature or your deeper inclinations.</p>
<p>不存在中立的关系。人们要么鼓励你，要么劝阻你寻找你自身的指导和力量的源泉。或许他们无意劝阻，但就其本质和强调而言，他们可以阻碍你。他们知道你是朋友。他们不知道你是在世界上寻求寻找他们在此的更伟大目的和使命的人。他们或许将你与愉快的活动或共同的兴趣联系在一起，他们也可能完全不知道你更深层次的自然或更深层次的倾向。</p>
<p>This is why it is so important to have a real ally, to have a relationship, at least one, with someone who can encourage this within you. For the world in general will discourage you from finding the power of Knowledge and developing the skills of vision and wisdom for yourself.</p>
<p>这就是为什么拥有一位真正的盟友、至少与一个能够鼓励你内心的人建立关系是如此重要。因为整个世界都会阻止你寻找内识的力量并发展你自己的远见和智慧的技能。</p>
<p>Here most people just give up and go along with everyone else. They do not have the strength or the determination to break free of their slavish thinking and behavior and to question their activities and their associations with others. This takes strength and courage to do this. It is very challenging, but it is essential if you are to discern where you are and what you are doing and where you really need to go with your life.</p>
<p>在这里，大多数人只是放弃并随波逐流。他们没有力量或决心摆脱他们的奴性思维和行为，质疑他们的活动和他们与他人的联系。这需要实力和勇气来做到这一点。这非常具有挑战性，但如果你辨别你在哪里、你在做什么以及你生命中真正需要去往的方向，这是必不可少的。</p>
<p>Because it is so easy to just give yourself away to others for a perceived benefit, for pleasure or security or wealth, you just go along with people, and you find that you are unknown to yourself, that your life is adrift, that you have no real sense of your inner direction, that you are in circumstances that do not speak to your heart. You are with people in situations that are not inspiring or really meaningful to you at all. It is as if your ship has gone off course and now you find yourself in strange and foreign waters, wondering how you got there.</p>
<p>因为为了所谓的利益，为了快乐、安全或财富，你很容易就把你自己交给了别人，你只是随波逐流，然后你会发现你不知道你自己，你的生命是漫无目的，你没有真正的内在方向感，你所处的环境与你的内心毫无关系。你所处的环境无法触动你的心，你所处的环境中的人对你没有任何启发或真正的意义。就好像你的船偏离了航线，现在你发现你自己身处陌生的水域，不知道自己是如何到达这里的。</p>
<p>It is better here to wake up late than never to wake up at all. For you are sent into the world for a greater purpose. You have the power of Knowledge within yourself. You have skills to learn and abilities to develop that are fundamental to who you are and to why you are here.</p>
<p>在这里，晚点醒来总比永远不醒来要好。因为你被派到这个世界是为了一个更伟大的目的。你内在拥有内识的力量。你有技能要学习，有能力要发展，这些对于你是谁以及你为什么在这里是至关重要的。</p>
<p>You have needs in the world. You have physical needs and psychological needs. But ultimately you have a greater need, the need of the soul, which is to discover this greater purpose and to express it in the changing circumstances of your life. If this greater need is not fulfilled, then you will not be fulfilled, and your life will not be fulfilled, and you will feel forever anxious and restless and discontented. No amount of pleasure or therapy can offset this if you are not attending to the greater need of your soul.</p>
<p>你在世界上有需求。你有生理需求和心理需求。但最终你有一个更大的需求，灵魂的需求，那就是发现这个更伟大的目的，并在你生命不断变化的境遇中表达它。如果这个更大的需求得不到满足，那么你就不会得到满足，你的生命也不会得到满足，你会永远感到焦虑、不安和不满。如果你不关注你灵魂的更大需求，再多的快乐或治疗也无法抵消这一点。</p>
<p>That is why We are giving you such great encouragement, giving you the keys to unlocking your greater abilities and your greater skills. For it is with these that you will be able to discern your true direction. It is these that will give you the strength and the courage and determination to reclaim your life and to set it in a different direction, a direction where it was always meant to go.</p>
<p>正因为如此，我们给予你如此伟大的鼓励，给予你解锁你更伟大能力和更伟大技能的钥匙。因为正是凭借这些，你将能够辨别你真正的方向。正是这些将给予你力量、勇气和决心，去重新掌控你的生命，并把它推向一个不同的方向，一个它一直注定要去的方向。</p>
<p>It is this power that will enable you to forgive your mistakes and to forgive yourself for acquiescing to others, for being powerless and irresponsible. It is this that will undo the damage from the past sufficiently and provide you the wisdom this damage can reveal. For your mistakes now become a resource for gaining wisdom and for sharing wisdom with others.</p>
<p>正是这种力量将使你能够原谅你自己的错误，原谅你自己对他人的默许、无能为力和不负责任。正是这种力量将充分消除过去的伤害，并为你提供这种伤害可以揭示的智慧。因为你的错误现在成为获得智慧并与他人分享智慧的资源。</p>
<p>The need for this in the world is immense. Beyond the need to feed people and to provide security for people, the need for wisdom is immense. People everywhere are wasting their lives, wasting their great opportunity to be in the world—their time, their energy, their resources—because they do not have this wisdom.</p>
<p>世界对此的需求是巨大的。除了为人们提供食物和安全之外，对智慧的需求也是巨大的。世界各地的人们都在浪费他们的生命，浪费他们身处这个世界的伟大机会——他们的时间、他们的能量、他们的资源——因为他们没有这种智慧。</p>
<p>In the wealthy nations where people have more freedom to pursue their fantasies, it is even a more tragic problem. Those who have the resources to be real contributors in the world, to fulfill themselves through a greater service to humanity and to the world are giving themselves away to the most trivial things, and are angry and depressed as a result.</p>
<p>在富裕国家，人们有更多的自由去追求他们的幻想，这甚至是一个更悲惨的问题。那些有资源成为世界真正的贡献者，通过为人类和世界提供更伟大的服务来实现自我价值的人，却把他们自己交给了最琐碎的事情，结果是感到愤怒和沮丧。</p>
<p>If you look without condemnation, you will see these things. They are all around you. You will see people not reaching for their greater destiny and their greater purpose. You will see people compromising themselves trying to be happy and comfortable with things that are wholly insufficient for their true nature and purpose.</p>
<p>如果你不带谴责地去看，你会看到这些事情。它们就在你周围。你会看到人们没有去追求他们更伟大的天命和他们更伟大的目的。你会看到人们的妥协，试图在那些完全不符合他们真正自然和目的的事物中感到快乐和舒适。</p>
<p>The demonstration of this is powerful and will reinforce for you the importance of gaining access to Knowledge and to the deeper current of your life, to bring your head above the fog that is keeping everyone in a state of animation and confusion.</p>
<p>这一点的证明是强有力的，它将向你强调获得内识和生命更深层次潮流的重要性，让你的头脑超越让每个人都处于活跃和困惑状态的迷雾。</p>
<p>You feel this need already. It is within you. It is the natural need to get up the mountain of life so that you can see the real panorama. You will see things here you could not see in the valleys and the forests below. You must make this journey. It is the most important journey in your life. It is the journey that rewards you with certainty, clarity and direction and brings into your life a quality of relationship that is far beyond what most people are experiencing in the world today.</p>
<p>你已经感觉到了这种需求。它就在你的内心。攀登生命之山，才能看到真正的全景，这是自然的需求。在这里，你会看到在山谷和下面的森林里看不到的风景。你必须踏上这段旅程。这是你生命中最重要的旅程。这段旅程会给你带来确定性、清晰度和方向，并给你的生命带来一种远远超出当今世界上大多数人所经历的关系质量。</p>
<p>But you must prepare. You cannot just have these things. You must build a desire for them and a capacity for them. They represent a series of skills and a deeper awareness. Every step you make in this direction restores to you your strength, your self-respect and your sense of enthusiasm about being in life. It is so fundamental.</p>
<p>但你必须做好准备。你不能只是拥有这些事情。你必须对它们产生渴望，并具备获得它们的能力。它们代表着一系列技能和一种更深层次的觉知。你朝这个方向迈出的每一步都会恢复你的力量、自尊和对生命的热情。它是如此根本。</p>
<p>You are not sent into the world to be miserable, to be compromised, to be depressed, to give your life away to simple pleasures and easy accommodations. You have a greater journey to take, a greater destiny. And your happiness and sense of fulfillment and the value of your relationships will all reflect whether you can take this journey or not.</p>
<p>你来到这个世界不是为了过一种痛苦、妥协、沮丧的生命，不是为了将你的生命交给简单的快乐和轻松的安逸。你还有更伟大的旅程要走，还有更伟大的天命要实现。你的幸福感、成就感和关系的价值都将反映出你是否能踏上了这段旅程。</p>
<p>It is a decision that you make every day as you bring a greater self-determination to bear in all of the affairs and events of your life. And if Knowledge is your guide, you will do this without condemnation, without hatred and enmity. You will do this as a natural response to a greater and more profound need within yourself. And you will look for this in others—this awareness, these skills, this clarity, this sobriety, this objectivity, this compassion—for that is what you are seeking for yourself.</p>
<p>它是你每天都要做出的决定，因为在你生命中的所有事务和事件中，你都要有一种更伟大的自我决定权。如果内识是你的向导，你就会不带谴责、仇恨和敌意地去做这件事。你这样做是对你自己内心更伟大、更深刻需求的自然回应。你会在他人身上寻找这一点——这种觉知、这些技能、这种清晰、这种清醒、这种客观行、这种同情心——因为内识就是你为你自己所寻求的目的。</p>
