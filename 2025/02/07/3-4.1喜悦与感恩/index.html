<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on January 31, 2009 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2009 年 1 月 31 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gratitude is something that can be experienced almost every minute if you are aware of the benefits of your life, however few they might be at any given time.</p>
<p>感恩是一种几乎每时每刻都能体验到的情感，只要你能察觉到生命中那些无论多么微小的益处。</p>
<p>Gratitude is a recognition of the giving of others and of the giving of life. It is a recognition of what you have right now. It is a recognition of the miracle of your existence.</p>
<p>感恩是对他人的付出和生命的奉献的认可。感恩是对你现在所拥有的一切的认可。感恩是对你存在的奇迹的认可。</p>
<p>As you gain a greater understanding of your nature and purpose in the world, you will begin to experience what a marvel it is that you even made it this far given all the hazards along the way, given all the difficulty of entering this separated existence, and all the work and coordination it took, both from your friends beyond the world and your friends here.</p>
<p>当你对你的自然和存在于世上的目的有了更伟大的理解时，你就会开始感受到，考虑到沿途的所有危险，考虑到进入这种分离存在的所有困难，考虑到为此所花费的所有努力和协调（来自世界之外的朋友和这里的朋友），你仍然能够走到今天，是多么的奇迹。</p>
<p>Even if you were born under very difficult or deprived circumstances, there is still a recognition of gratitude. For many people, this recognition should be substantial.</p>
<p>即使出生在非常艰苦或贫困的环境中，仍然会心存感激。对许多人来说，这种感激应该是实质性的。</p>
<p>It is so easy to take for granted your existence and the many wonderful things that have been created for your convenience or for your comforts. If you are aware of these things and are looking with an open mind, then you will be able to experience this gratitude.</p>
<p>人们很容易把你的存在和许多为了你的方便或舒适而创造的美好事物视为理所当然。如果你察觉到这些事情并以开放的心态看待，那么你将能够体验到这种感激之情。</p>
<p>Gratitude here is such a counterpoint for disappointment, for failed expectations and for the inability to express yourself successfully with others. It is such a counterpoint to all the things you think you want and need for yourself that you cannot seem to attain. It is a counterpoint to the endless busyness and recklessness with which people try to live their lives—always striving to have more, striving to keep what they have, striving to control their situation, striving to fulfill their desires or in some cases even to live out their fantasies.</p>
<p>此处的感恩是针对失望、未能实现的期望以及无法成功地向他人表达自我的一种对比。它是针对所有你认为你想要和需要但似乎无法实现的事情的一种对比。它是针对人们试图过好他们生命的无尽忙碌和鲁莽的一种对比——他们总是努力拥有更多，努力保留他们所拥有的，努力掌控他们的处境，努力满足他们的欲望，或者在某些情况下甚至实现他们的幻想。</p>
<p>Gratitude is a recognition in the moment. It is a recognition not from a position of striving, not from a position of trying to acquire things, not from a position of trying to fulfill your ambitions, but from a quieter place of recognition.</p>
<p>感恩是当下的一种认知。这种认知不是来自奋斗的立场，不是来自试图获得事物的立场，不是来自试图实现抱负的立场，而是来自一种更安静的认知。</p>
<p>It is so evident that people can live in houses of splendor with hundreds and even thousands of conveniences and be utterly miserable because they think they are not getting what they want. They are unhappy because of events that happened even in childhood that are still haunting them and destroying their ability to appreciate their life and to experience life and to live life fully in the moment. How can it be that an intelligent person could live in a house of splendor and be so unhappy and so unfulfilled?</p>
<p>显而易见的是，人们可以住在富丽堂皇的房子里，享受着成百上千甚至上万种便利，却因为他们认为自己没有得到想要的东西而无比痛苦。他们之所以不快乐，是因为童年时发生的事情至今仍在困扰着他们，摧毁了他们欣赏生命、体验生命和充分享受当下生命的能力。一个聪明的人住在豪华住宅中，怎么会如此不快乐、如此不满足呢？</p>
<p>Perhaps they should go live in a village somewhere in a poor part of the world without electricity, without supermarkets, without automobiles, without all the myriad of conveniences that they use and experience every day.</p>
<p>也许他们应该去世界上某个贫穷地区的村庄生活，那里没有电、没有超市、没有汽车，也没有他们每天使用和体验的各种便利设施。</p>
<p>Go live in the village which has none of these things, and just begin to recognize that even under these far simpler and even impoverished circumstances, there can be great joy and gratitude: gratitude for each meal, gratitude for the sunrise, gratitude for the caring and friendliness of another, gratitude that your mind is free to think and to reconsider your life, gratitude that your heart can beat without your trying to regulate it or even being aware of it, gratitude for the experience of nature and wildlife. Even under the simplest circumstances, the wonder of life can be yours.</p>
<p>去一个没有这些东西的村庄生活，开始认识到，即使在这些简单得多甚至贫困的环境中，也能有巨大的快乐和感激：感激每一顿饭，感激日出，感激他人的关心和友好，感激你的心灵可以自由思考和重新考虑你的生命，感激你的心脏可以跳动而你不需要试图调节它甚至没有察觉到它，感激大自然和野生动物的体验。即使在最简单的情况下，生命的奇迹也可以属于你。</p>
<p>And if you were to return to your house of splendor, you would be stunned and amazed at all that it can do for you. You flick a switch, the lights come on. You flick a switch, the heat comes on. You do not have to gather wood and build a fire. You do not have to burn candles to see by at night. You can wash your clothes in a machine instead of walking to the river and spending four hours cleaning them.</p>
<p>如果你回到你那富丽堂皇的房子，你会惊讶于它能为你做的一切。你轻轻一按开关，灯就亮了。你轻轻一按开关，暖气就来了。你不必去捡柴生火。你不必在晚上点蜡烛才能看清道路。你可以用洗衣机洗衣服，而不必走到河边花四个小时洗衣服。</p>
<p>It would be so meaningful if people could trade places even for a short time. The very poor could live with the very rich, and vice versa.</p>
<p>如果人们能够交换位置，哪怕只是很短的时间，那也是很有意义的。非常贫穷的人可以和非常富有的人生活在一起，反之亦然。</p>
<p>Yet the rich suffer as if they have nothing. They cannot enjoy life because they have never connected with the deeper current of their life within themselves. Life for them has been about acquiring things, acquiring people, acquiring possessions, acquiring opportunities and acquiring advantages. And even to the degree to which they are successful, they experience no joy and only fleeting moments of gratitude.</p>
<p>然而富人却像一无所有一样受苦。他们无法享受生命，因为他们从未与他们自己内心更深层次的生命之流相联接。对他们来说，生命就是获取物质、获取人、获取财产、获取机会和获取优势。即使他们取得了一定程度的成功，他们也体验不到任何快乐，只有短暂的感激之情。</p>
<p>Are they grateful that someone grew the food that they are now eating at the table? Are they grateful that someone spent their life inventing the refrigerator that keeps their food fresh? Are they grateful for the laborers who built their house? Are they grateful for the police and the fire department that is there at their call to protect them and their property?</p>
<p>他们是否感激有人种植了他们现在餐桌上的食物？他们是否感激有人毕生发明了冰箱，让他们的食物保持新鲜？他们是否感激建造他们房屋的劳动者？他们是否感激警察和消防部门随时待命，保护他们和他们的财产？</p>
<p>If you were aware of these wonderful things and considered what it took to create them, and the lives that were given to create them, the careers that were spent creating them, you would not have time to suffer the way you do now. You would not have time to experience so much disappointment and frustration and confusion. You would be too busy experiencing the value of your life—what you have and the opportunities that you have, to whatever degree they exist.</p>
<p>如果你察觉到这些美好的事物，并考虑到创造它们所付出的代价，以及为创造它们而付出的生命，以及为创造它们而付出的事业，你就不会像现在这样受苦。你也不会有时间经历这么多的失望、挫折和困惑。你会忙于体验你生命的价值——你拥有什么，你拥有多少机会，无论它们存在到何种程度。</p>
<p>For most people who hear these words, these opportunities are immense compared to what your ancestors had to face. Give up driving a car for a year and then have the experience of driving a car. You will be amazed at what a marvelous convenience it is. But who can experience this without this contrast?</p>
<p>对于大多数听到这些话的人来说，这些机会与你的祖先所面对的相比是巨大的。放弃开车一年，然后体验开车。你会惊讶于它有多么方便。但是，没有这种对比，谁能体验到这一点呢？</p>
<p>Perhaps humanity needs to be deprived of so many of these conveniences—the wealthy nations all of sudden do not have many of these conveniences—in order to really experience their value, the marvel of their existence and the tremendous human effort and dedication that had to be focused to create these things. Instead of living a life of complaint, frustration and anger, you would see things very differently.</p>
<p>也许人类需要被剥夺这么多便利——富裕国家突然间没有这么多便利——才能真正体验到它们的价值、它们存在的奇迹以及创造这些东西所必须付出的巨大努力和奉献。与其过着抱怨、沮丧和愤怒的生命，不如用完全不同的眼光看待事物。</p>
<p>The inability to marvel at your own life and circumstances represents a cruel effect of not being connected to the deeper current of your life, of not experiencing the miracle that you are not only alive but that you are here for a greater purpose, that you have a life beyond this world, a life from which you have come and to which you will return, and that you have not come into this world empty handed, but were indeed sent here for a purpose that you have yet to discover.</p>
<p>无法惊叹于你自身的生命和处境，代表着无法与生命更深层次的潮流相联接的残酷后果，无法体验到这样的奇迹：你不仅活着，而且你来到这里是为了一个更伟大的目的，你拥有超越这个世界的生命，你来自这个世界，也将回归这个世界，你并非空手而来，而是确实为了尚未发现的目的而被派到这里。</p>
<p>It is such a major breakthrough to have this experience and this awareness. For not only are you endowed with wonderful things and have wonderful opportunities, you also have the promise of a greater fulfillment in the world through the discovery and the expression of your greater purpose, and the immensely powerful relationships this will bring into your life, a life that will yield greater gifts to the world than you can now even think of.</p>
<p>拥有这种体验和觉知是一种重大突破。因为你不仅拥有了美好的事物和美好的机遇，你还承诺通过发现和表达你的更伟大目的，以及这将给你的生命带来的无比强大的关系，让你在世界上获得更大的成就，这种生命将为世界带来比你现在想象的更伟大的礼物。</p>
<p>If you are not experiencing joy and gratitude on a regular basis, you are disassociated from your real life and existence here, and you have let the trials of the world and your own disappointments in little things overtake you.</p>
<p>如果你没有经常感受到快乐和感激，您就会脱离实际的生命和存在，并且会让世间的考验和你自身对小事的失望压倒你。</p>
<p>Of course, you cannot have everything you want. Some of the greater things you may want you are not even ready for. For example, people want wonderful relationships or a great marriage, but they are not ready for these things. They are not circumstantially ready. They are not emotionally ready. They are not psychologically ready, and yet they are suffering and pining away because they do not have something they think they want and should have right now.</p>
<p>当然，你不可能拥有你想要的一切。你可能想要的某些更重要的东西你甚至还没有准备好。例如，人们想要美好的关系或美满的婚姻，但他们还没有为这些事情做好准备。他们没有在环境上做好准备。他们没有在情感上做好准备。他们没有在心理上做好准备，然而他们却在受苦和憔悴，因为他们没有得到他们认为他们想要的和现在应该拥有的东西。</p>
<p>If they had a deeper understanding of themselves and a deeper experience of the real meaning of their life, they would be able to see this in a greater perspective. They would be able to look at their life more objectively and say, “Well, yes, I do want this, but I can see how I am not ready for it.”</p>
<p>如果他们对他们自己有一种更深层次的理解，对他们生命的真正意义有更深层次的体验，他们就能够从更伟大的视角看待这一点。他们将能够更客观地看待他们的生命，并说：“嗯，是的，我确实想要这个，但我可以看到我还没有为它做好准备。”</p>
<p>It is your unfulfilled desires, your failed expectations, your thwarted intentions and your inability to express yourself that keep you in a state of aggravation and depression—missing the wonderful moments of life, missing the experiences of nature, missing the gratitude of what you have and who you are and what is available to you, missing life as if you were living in paradise, but you were caught up in a very fearful dream and could not awaken to your own existence.</p>
<p>正是你未实现的愿望、落空的期望、受挫的意图以及无法表达你自己，让你处于恼怒和沮丧的状态——错过生命中的精彩时刻，错过大自然的体验，错过对你所拥有的、你是谁以及你所能得到的感激，错过仿佛生活在天堂的生命，但是你陷入了一个非常可怕的梦境，无法醒来发现你自身的存在。</p>
<p>Then there is living under the cloud of fear—fear that you are losing, fear that you will lose, fear that you will not have what you want, fear that you will miss out on something, fear that you will lose your achievements or your stature, fear that you will lose your health, fear that you will lose your mind, fear of deprivation, fear of chaos, fear of rejection by others and ultimately fear of death itself.</p>
<p>然后就是生活在恐惧的阴云之下——害怕你正在失去，害怕你会失败，害怕你得不到你想要的东西，害怕你会错过一些东西，害怕你会失去你的成就或地位，害怕你会失去健康，害怕你会失去理智，害怕被剥夺，害怕混乱，害怕被他人拒绝，最终害怕死亡本身。</p>
<p>So afraid, and yet unless you are facing imminent threat of destruction or the imminent threat of utter devastation, why would you live under this fear—missing the joy and the gratitude of life, missing what you have achieved and what others have achieved, missing the marvelous experiences that you could have every day? It is like you are dying a thousand times, dying every day for want of living.</p>
<p>如此害怕，但除非你正面临毁灭的迫在眉睫的威胁，或者彻底毁灭的迫在眉睫的威胁，否则你为什么要生活在这种恐惧之中——错过生命的快乐和感恩，错过你已经取得的成就和别人已经取得的成就，错过你每天都可以拥有的奇妙体验？它就像你死了一千次，每天都因为不想活而死去。</p>
<p>When death finally comes to your life and you leave this world, and you leave your personality and your body behind, it will only take really a very short time. But in your mind you can be dying for hours, days and years—dying without living, living without gratitude, living without the experience that you are here to serve a greater purpose and that your life is moving in a certain direction.</p>
<p>当死亡最终降临到你的生命中，你离开这个世界，你抛弃你的人格和你的身体时，这真的只需要很短的时间。但在你的心灵中，你可能已经死去几个小时、几天和几年了——死去却没有活过，活着却没有感激，活着却没有体验到你在这里是为了服务于一个更伟大目的，你的生命正在朝着某个方向前进。</p>
<p>Now the emphasis on joy and gratitude does not deny the problems that you face, the situations that you must correct, the false obligations you must undo, the false attractions you must distance yourself from, the compromises that you must rectify, the bad decisions that you must correct and so forth. That is the work of life. That is your spiritual work and your practical work, but all along the way there is the experience of gratitude.</p>
<p>现在，强调喜悦和感恩并不否认你所面临的问题、你必须纠正的情况、你必须解除的虚假义务、你必须远离的虚假吸引力、你必须纠正的妥协、你必须纠正的错误决定等等。这就是生命的工作。这是你的精神工作和实际工作，但一路上都有感恩的体验。</p>
<p>Look at where you live and think how amazing it is that you could live in such a place. It is warm in the winter, dry in the rain. Look at all your comforts and conveniences, and think of the people who created these so that you could enjoy them. Be happy with what you have because you have so much already.</p>
<p>看看你住的地方，想想你能住在这样的地方是多么美妙。冬天温暖，雨天干燥。看看你所有的舒适和便利，想想那些为你创造这些的人，让你可以享受它们。对你拥有的一切感到高兴，因为你已经拥有如此之多。</p>
<p>Unless you are living in a state of extreme poverty, you have so much already. Look at your clothing. You have more than you need. You are rich. If you do not think you are rich, you should go somewhere where you would be rich, and you will see why you are suffering over nothing.</p>
<p>除非你生活在极度贫困的状态中，否则你已经拥有很多。看看你的衣服。你拥有的比你需要的还多。你很富有。如果你不认为你是富有的，那么你应该去一个你可以变得富有的地方，你就会明白为什么你会为一些小事而受苦。</p>
<p>Go into your bathroom and look at your medications and see what a miracle it is that they can exist, for many people in the world do not have access to these things. Look out upon your street. It is a miracle you even have a street or streetlights or a sidewalk and all the services that your city provides for you. How would you be if you did not have these things?</p>
<p>走进你的浴室，看看你的药物，看看它们能存在是多么神奇，因为世界上有许多人无法获得这些东西。看看你的街道。你甚至有街道、路灯或人行道以及你的城市为你提供的所有服务，这真是一个奇迹。如果你没有这些东西，你会怎么样？</p>
<p>Do not assume you will always have these things, for the great waves of life are coming to the world and will deprive many people of many things.</p>
<p>不要认为你会一直拥有这些东西，因为生命的巨浪正在向世界袭来，会让许多人失去很多东西。</p>
<p>Be glad you live in a country that is currently at peace and not living in a state of war. Be grateful that your nation is not being attacked by other nations that seek to conquer it, suppress it and overtake it.</p>
<p>庆幸你生活在一个目前处于和平状态而非战争状态的国家。庆幸你的国家没有受到其他国家的攻击，没有被它们征服、压制和超越。</p>
<p>Look at nature and all of its details. Look at a rose bush and all of its details and you cannot be depressed. People who look at the details of nature rarely are depressed because they are marveling at life, life on a very small scale. You could look at a plant in a pot on your windowsill and be amazed at its shape and its evolution.</p>
<p>观察大自然及其所有细节。观察一株玫瑰花丛及其所有细节，你就不会感到沮丧。观察大自然细节的人很少感到沮丧，因为他们惊叹于生命，惊叹于非常小规模的生命。你可以观察窗台上盆栽的植物，惊叹于它的形状和进化。</p>
<p>You have to break free of the habits and the preoccupations that keep you living in a state of fear and frustration. You have to limit how much bad news you let into your home through the media that keeps you in a state of frustration and aggravation.</p>
<p>你必须摆脱那些让你生活在恐惧和沮丧中的习惯和成见。你必须限制通过媒体向你传播的坏消息，因为这些坏消息会让你处于沮丧和恼怒的状态。</p>
<p>You have to slow your life down and learn to be still so that you can hear the deeper voice of Knowledge within you and so you will have the presence of mind to recognize the great miracles of your life.</p>
<p>你必须放慢你的生命节奏，学会静下心来，这样你才能听到你内心更深层次的内识的声音，这样你的心灵才能去认识到你生命中的伟大奇迹。</p>
<p>You have to do fewer things but with a greater awareness and participation. All this frantic running around, trying to have and be and do all these things is keeping you from experiencing not only the great value of life, but an awareness of the deeper Knowledge that lives within you.</p>
<p>你必须做更少的事情，但要有一种更伟大的觉知和参与度。所有这些疯狂的奔波，试图拥有、成为和做所有这些事情，不仅让你无法体验生命的伟大价值，而且让你无法觉知正生活在你内心更深层次的内识。</p>
<p>If your life is more simple, then you are able to experience it more fully and more happily. If your mind is not constantly caught up in striving after things or chasing romance or trying to acquire wealth and advantage, you can begin to experience gratitude.</p>
<p>如果你的生命更简单，那么你就能更充分、更快乐地体验生命。如果你的心灵不再总是被追求事物、追求浪漫或试图获得财富和优势所困扰，你就可以开始感受到感激之情。</p>
<p>Sit quietly in your room and look at everything in the room and think about what it took to create that—the labor it took to create it, the invention that it took to create such a thing, the transportation that brought it to you, the availability of it for you, the fact that you could purchase it, and what value it could give you and does give you every day.</p>
<p>静静地坐在你的房间里，看着房间里的一切，想想创造它需要什么——创造它需要的劳动力，创造这样的东西需要的发明，把它带到你身边的交通，它对你来说是可用的，你可以购买它的事实，以及它能给你的价值，以及它每天都在给你的价值。</p>
<p>This is a whole different way of being with life. It is being with life. Instead of racing through life trying to fulfill your wish list, you are now being with life. You are tending to what is real, not what is imaginary. You are slowing your mind down so that it can see and recognize the very things in your environment that you hardly ever think of.</p>
<p>这是一种与生命相处的完全不同的方式。这就是与生命同在。你不再匆匆忙忙地度过一生，试图实现你的愿望清单，而是与生命同在。你关注的是真实，而不是想象。你正在放慢你的心灵，这样它就可以看到和识别出你几乎从未想过的环境中的内识。</p>
<p>If you think about what life has given you, you could not avoid gratitude—gratitude at a level you have never experienced before, gratitude for the people who lost their lives so that your nation could have free or progressive institutions, gratitude for the simplest things.</p>
<p>如果你回想一下生命给予你的一切，你就无法回避感激之情——一种你从未体验过的感激之情，感激那些为了让你的国家拥有自由或进步的制度而牺牲生命的人们，对最简单的事情心存感激。</p>
<p>Ultimately, this gratitude is towards God because that is where your natural gratitude will go when you begin to take stock of the miracles of your life.</p>
<p>归根结底，这种感激是对上帝的感激，因为当你开始评估你生命中的奇迹时，你自然的感激之情就会流向上帝。</p>
<p>As you begin to discern the deeper Knowledge that God has placed within you to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to a greater experience of being in the world, this gratitude will grow. And you will feel that you are moving in a greater direction rather than merely surviving day by day.</p>
<p>当你开始分辨上帝放置在你内在的更深层次的内识，它指引你、保护你、引领你走向存在于这个世界的更伟大体验时，这种感激将会增长。你将感觉到你正在走向一个更伟大的方向，而不仅仅是日复一日地生存。</p>
<p>The gratitude that emerges out of the recognition that you are here for a greater purpose and that you do not have to control this purpose or understand it to be able to participate in it fully—that is the cause of gratitude and joyfulness.</p>
<p>你认识到你来到这里是为了一个更伟大目的，你不必控制这个目的或理解它，就能充分参与其中，而这种理解所带来的感激之情正是感恩和喜悦的根源。</p>
<p>Instead of running around one day, go through everything you own and imagine what a wonderful thing it is to have these things, and that you can acquire such things, and that you can give them away to others who might need them.</p>
<p>与其有一天四处奔波，不如仔细检查你所拥有的一切，想象拥有这些东西是一件多么美妙的事情，想象你可以获得这些东西，想象你可以把它们送给其他可能需要它们的人。</p>
<p>This is called being with life. This is being present to your life and your circumstances. Yes, you still have problems to solve and mistakes to undo and skills to cultivate, but it is your ability to be present to life that will open your mind and your heart.</p>
<p>这被称为与生命同在。这就是面对你的生命和你的处境。是的，你仍然有需要解决的问题、需要改正的错误和需要培养的技能，但正是你与生命同在的能力将打开你的心灵和你的内心。</p>
<p>When it rains, go watch the rain. It is a miracle. What if it did not rain ever again? Your life would be doomed. Your life would collapse. Everything you value could be undone. Your opportunity to be in the world could come to an end. And yet it rains, and the plants grow, and the sun will shine tomorrow.</p>
<p>下雨的时候，去看雨。这是一个奇迹。如果再也不下雨了会怎么样？你的生命将注定失败。你的生命将崩溃。你所珍视的一切都会化为乌有。你存在于这个世界上的机会可能就此结束。然而，下雨了，植物生长了，明天的太阳也会照耀大地。</p>
<p>Even if you were to contemplate your physical vehicle—your body and your intellect, both of which are vehicles of communication in the world—they are marvelous to contemplate.</p>
<p>即使你要思考你的物质载体——你的身体和你的智力，它们都是在世界上沟通的载体——思考它们也是很奇妙的。</p>
<p>If you learn about human physiology, it is such a marvelous creation. No one can build a machine that could do this—a self-generating life force, a heart that beats on its own, lungs that breathe on their own and all of the involuntary responses that your body makes every moment.</p>
<p>如果你学习关于人体的生理学，就会发现这是一个多么奇妙的创造。没有人能制造出一台机器能做到这一点——一种自我产生的生命力、一颗自己跳动的心脏、一个自己呼吸的肺以及你的身体每时每刻都在做出的所有不自主反应。</p>
<p>Or contemplate your intellect—the marvelous things it can do, the problems it can solve, the things it can create, the dreams that it can dream. What if you did not have an intellect and lived life like an ant?</p>
<p>或者思考一下你的智力——它能做多少奇妙的事情，能解决多少问题，能创造多少事物，能做多少梦。如果你没有智力，生活得像蚂蚁，会怎样？</p>
<p>You see, people are missing everything, wanting something else, angry that they did not get something in the past, distrustful of life, angry towards others, hateful towards others, condemning of nations and governments, angry over the little tiny things that frustrate them, when in fact 99 percent of their life is working marvelously. One percent is not working very well, but the one percent is all they are concerned with.</p>
<p>你看，人们错过了一切，想要别的东西，为过去没有得到的东西而感到愤怒，对生命的不信任，对他人的愤怒，对他人的憎恨，谴责国家和政府，对令他们沮丧的琐碎事情而感到愤怒，而事实上，他们生命中的 99% 都运行良好。只有 1% 运行得不太好，但他们只关心 1%。</p>
<p>What can you do for someone like this but bring them back to life, give them an escape from their tormented mind and open a deeper connection to the power and presence of Knowledge within them—the mind beyond the mind—to take them beneath the surface of their mind to the deeper current of their life and to the well of Knowledge that lives within them?</p>
<p>你能为这样的人做些什么呢？除了让他们重获新生，让他们从饱受折磨的心灵中解脱出来，开启与他们内心内识的力量和存在——超越心灵的心灵——的更深层次的联接，带他们在心灵的表面之下，进入生命更深层次的潮流，进入他们内心的内识之井，你还能为他们做些什么呢？</p>
<p>This is called redemption. This is rescuing a person from a self-tormented life. This is rescuing a person from a pursuit that will never be successful and has never been successful in reality. This is returning to relationship with yourself and an appreciation of your relationship with everything around you.</p>
<p>这被称为救赎。这是把一个人从自我折磨的生命中拯救出来。这是把一个人从永远不会成功、在现实中从未成功的追求中拯救出来。这是回归与你自己的关系，以及对你与周围一切的关系的欣赏。</p>
<p>It is the returning to gratitude and the ability to experience joyfulness, joyfulness over the simplest things—joyfulness that you are there, your heart is beating, you are seeing something, you are experiencing a connection with life.</p>
<p>它是对感恩的回归和体验快乐的能力，对最简单的事情的快乐——你在那里的快乐，你的心在跳动，你看到了一些东西，你正在体验与生命的一种联接。</p>
<p>You are grateful for what you have. You are grateful for the world that you have. You are grateful for your opportunities. You are even grateful for your disappointments, which in most cases will show you that you need to alter your approach and your expectations.</p>
<p>你感激你所拥有的一切。你感激你所拥有的世界。你感激你的机会。你甚至感激你的失望，在大多数情况下，这会向你表明你需要改变你的方法和期望。</p>
<p>This will require a lot of practice because it is a very different way of being in the moment. It is a very different way of being with everything. You cannot undo a lifetime of habit in a day or a week or a month, so it will take constant practice, and it cannot be an empty practice. You can look at something and say, “Oh, I am grateful for that,” but if you do not feel it, if it is not really impressing upon you, then it is just a meaningless exercise.</p>
<p>这需要大量的练习，因为这是一种截然不同的处世方式。这也是一种对待一切事物的截然不同的方式。你不可能在一天、一周或一个月内改变一生的习惯，所以这需要不断的练习，而且这不能是一种空洞的练习。你可以看着某样东西说：“哦，我很感激”，但如果你没有感受到它，如果它没有真正打动你，那么这只是一种毫无意义的练习。</p>
<p>Ask yourself, “Do I want to focus on the one percent that is not working well and miss the 99 percent that is working well?”</p>
<p>问问你自己：“我是否愿意只关注那 1% 效果不佳的部分，而忽略 99% 效果良好的部分？”</p>
<p>Look at all the things you own. Ninety-nine percent of them work every day—your machines, your conveniences, your possessions. They are working for you as if you were a king of a nation and the whole nation is working for you—a king or a queen, and you have all this working for you.</p>
<p>看看你自身拥有的一切。百分之九十九的东西每天都在工作——你的机器、你的便利设施、你的财产。它们为你工作，就好像你是一个国家的国王，整个国家都在为你工作——一位国王或一位王后，而你拥有所有这些为你工作。</p>
<p>Be happy with what you have. Learn to recognize what you have. Deeply experience what you have as an antidote to this endless wanting and searching and yearning and all of the unhappiness, disappointment and aggravation that it brings to you.</p>
<p>对你拥有的东西感到高兴。学会认识你拥有的东西。深刻体验你拥有的事物，将其作为对这种无尽的欲望、寻找和渴望以及由此带来的所有不快乐、失望和恼怒的解药。</p>
<p>The greater things that your soul requires will be fulfilled as you follow Knowledge within yourself. Without Knowledge, you cannot find this fulfillment. But Knowledge does not require the kind of striving, desperate life that you perhaps have been living for so many years.</p>
<p>当你追随你自己内在的内识时，你灵魂所要求的更伟大目的将得到满足。没有内识，你就无法找到这种满足。但内识并不需要你多年来可能一直过的那种奋斗、绝望的生命。</p>
<p>As you begin to recognize all the relationships you have with people, places and things, it will slow your life down. You will not have to be searching for the next thing, for you will be with whatever exists now.</p>
<p>当你开始认识到你与人、地方和事物的所有关系时，你的生命就会慢下来。你不必寻找下一件事，因为你将与现在存在的一切在一起。</p>
<p>Learning The Way of Knowledge will slow your mind down, will bring you back into the core relationship with your own deeper experience, and your core relationship with everything around you. This is the environment for gratitude.</p>
<p>学习内识之路将让你的心灵慢下来，让你回到与你自身更深层次体验的核心关系中，以及与周围一切事物的核心关系中。这就是感恩的环境。</p>
<p>Though Knowledge will show you that there are many things you must adjust or correct, it will also bring you into a state of recognition of the miracles of your life. So while there is work to be done, there is great joy to be experienced and immense gratitude to be experienced.</p>
<p>虽然内识会告诉你，有很多事情你必须调整或改正，但它也会让你进入一种认识到你生命奇迹的状态。因此，虽然有工作要做，但也有伟大的喜悦和无尽的感激之情。</p>
<p>This is a practice and a focus for you now. It is part of your redemption, your return to the greater power and the greater purpose that guide your life.</p>
<p>这是你现在的练习和关注点。它是你救赎的一部分，是你回归更伟大力量和指导你生命的更伟大目的的一部分。</p>
<p>It is the return to relationship from Separation.</p>
<p>它是从分离中回归到关系。</p>
<p>It is an escape from the torment of your mind to the power and the presence of a deeper nature that you carry within yourself. It is a return to recognition. It is a return to appreciation. It is a return to the sacredness of life and to the many joys and opportunities that present themselves to you every day.</p>
<p>它是从你心灵的折磨中逃脱，走向你内在所拥有的更深层次自然的力量和存在。它是一种认知的回归。它是一种对欣赏的回归。它是一种对生命的神圣性的回归，以及对每天呈现在你面前的众多欢乐和机遇的回归。</p>
<p>Though your health may not be what you want it to be, though your circumstances may not be what you want them to be, though you may have great problems to deal with, it is this joy and this gratitude that will make your life full today.</p>
<p>尽管你的健康状况可能不如你所愿，尽管你的处境可能不如你所愿，尽管你可能有很大的问题需要处理，但正是这种快乐和感激之情会让你今天的生命变得充实。</p>
<p>For you have much to be grateful for, and the more you recognize this, the more you will have confidence that there is a Greater Power working in your life that will give you the vision, the wisdom and the strength to carry out whatever you must carry out, to resolve whatever problem is bearing down upon you, and ultimately to give you relief from your own disconnected and desperate life to the greater joy and gratitude that are natural for you to experience every day.</p>
<p>因为你有许多值得感激的事情，你越认识到这一点，你就越有信心，有一个更伟大力量在你的生命中运作，它将赋予你远见、智慧和力量，去完成你必须完成的一切，去解决压在你身上的任何问题，并最终让你摆脱你自身脱节和绝望的生命，走向你每天自然体验到的更伟大喜悦和感激。</p>
