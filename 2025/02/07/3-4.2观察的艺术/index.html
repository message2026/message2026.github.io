<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on April 11, 2011 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2011 年 4 月 11 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God has given you the eyes to see and the ears to hear, but this seeing and this hearing are very different from what you are accustomed to. For your sight is dimmed by the confusion of your mind and by the myriad of impressions from the world that you have been accumulating for so very long.</p>
<p>上帝已经赋予你眼睛去看，耳朵去听，但这种看和听与你习惯的截然不同。因为你的心灵是混乱的，以及你长期以来积累的来自世界的无数印象，使你的视力变得模糊。</p>
<p>Your ears are dull. They are only attuned to certain things, and they only listen to certain things.</p>
<p>你的耳朵是迟钝的。它们只能适应某些特定的事物，只能听到某些特定的事物。</p>
<p>So while you have the natural endowments in varying degrees in people, in almost all cases these endowments have not really been cultivated and applied wisely and appropriately.</p>
<p>因此，尽管人们不同程度地拥有自然的禀赋，但在几乎所有情况下，这些禀赋都没有得到真正的培养和明智而适当的运用。</p>
<p>God has given you the greater Intelligence of Knowledge to guide you. But for you to develop your ability to follow Knowledge and to experience it and to express it effectively in the world—in a world where Knowledge is not recognized or appreciated—you must develop these skills.</p>
<p>上帝已经给了你内识的更伟大智能来指导你。但为了让你发展出遵循内识、体验内识并在世界上有效表达内识的能力——在一个内识不被认可或欣赏的世界上——你必须发展这些技能。</p>
<p>Your body is a marvelous instrument, but its true qualities have not been recognized and developed in nearly all cases.</p>
<p>您的身体是一个奇妙的工具，但在几乎所有情况下，它的真正品质都尚未得到认识和开发。</p>
<p>Your mind has become a tyrant, an oppressor governed by social conventions, fear, desire and expectation. But it too is a wonderful instrument for navigating a changing world, for creating marvelous things in service to people and being an instrument of communication. But it too has not been cultivated and is not being used to its greater potential and for its greater purpose.</p>
<p>你的心灵已经成为一个暴君，一个被社会习俗、恐惧、欲望和期望所统治的压迫者。但它也是一个奇妙的工具，可以驾驭不断变化的世界，可以创造奇妙的东西为人们服务，可以成为一个沟通的工具。但它也没有得到培养，也没有被使用来发挥其更伟大的潜力和实现它更伟大的目的。</p>
<p>To see and to hear clearly, your mind must be still, or you will be looking, but not seeing. You will be listening, but not hearing. You will be caught up in your internal considerations, whatever they may be—fantasies and fears and problem solving, judging and evaluating others, judging and evaluating yourself and so forth.</p>
<p>要想看得清楚，听得明白，你的心灵必须保持静止，否则你只会看，却看不到。你会听，却听不到。你会沉浸在你内部的考虑中，无论它们是什么——幻想、恐惧和解决问题、判断和评价他人、判断和评价你自己等等。</p>
<p>To see, you must be very present, bringing your whole attention to focus. As if you were looking through binoculars, you are trying to focus and really see some distant object, and listening as if you were trying to hear a conversation somewhere beyond you over there, giving it your full attention.</p>
<p>要看，你必须非常在场，带着你的整个注意力去集中。就像用望远镜看一样，你要集中注意力，真正看到远处的某个物体，要全神贯注地倾听，就像你试图听到远处某处的对话一样。</p>
<p>So the first step is complete presence of mind, and this is not easy for people because they have not practiced it. It is available to them, but they have not practiced.</p>
<p>所以第一步是完全集中注意力，这对人们来说并不容易，因为他们没有练习过。他们可以做到，但他们没有练习过。</p>
<p>You have muscles in your body that can do wonderful things, but they cannot carry any great weight or do anything beyond simple movements unless you develop their skills and application. It is the same with seeing and hearing.</p>
<p>你身体里的肌肉可以做出奇妙的事情，但是除非你开发它们的技能和应用，否则它们无法承受任何巨大的重量，也无法做任何超出简单动作的事情。视觉和听觉也是如此。</p>
<p>Your attention cannot be momentary. Eventually you should be able to sit for an hour and listen or see and look—without your mind interfering, without trying to come to conclusions, without trying to get what you want, without evaluating the situation or your abilities—just looking and listening.</p>
<p>你的注意力不能一时一刻地集中。最终你应该能够坐下来花一个小时聆听、观察和观看——不受你心灵的干扰，不试图得出结论，不试图得到你想要的东西，不评估情况或你的能力——只是观察和聆听。</p>
<p>True seeing involves inner listening always. This engages the entire mind—opening it both to perception of the outer world and to the presence of Knowledge in the inner world.</p>
<p>真正的观察总是需要内心的聆听。这需要整个心灵参与其中——既要对外部世界有感知，又要对内心世界的内识有感知。</p>
<p>Here you are listening for Knowledge. You are listening for a deeper response. You are not listening to your thoughts or your emotions. You are listening in the outer world at the same time for every little sound.</p>
<p>在这里，你正在聆听内识。你正在聆听更深层次的回应。你不是在聆听你的思想或你的情感。你同时在聆听外部世界的每一个细微声音。</p>
<p>So it is best to practice in a very quiet place to begin with so you are not overwhelmed with the sounds and sights of the world around you—perhaps a temple or a mosque or a church or out in nature, whatever is a quiet environment; or a room or a closet, whatever is a quiet environment.</p>
<p>因此，最好一开始就在一个非常安静的地方练习，这样你就不会被周围世界的声音和景象所淹没——也许是寺庙、清真寺、教堂或大自然中，只要是一个安静的环境；或者是一个房间或一个壁橱，只要是一个安静的环境。</p>
<p>For people living in large cities where there is very little quiet, sometimes closets can be transformed into practice environments to great effect.</p>
<p>对于生活在大城市、很少有安静环境的人们来说，有时衣柜可以改造成效果极佳的练习环境。</p>
<p>You want to be able to focus and not be overwhelmed by everything around you, so do not think you can practice out in city streets to begin with, for you do not have the powers of concentration and discernment yet to be able to function in such a noisy and difficult situation.</p>
<p>你希望能够集中注意力，不被周围的一切所淹没，所以不要认为你可以在城市街道上开始练习，因为你还没有集中注意力和辨别的能力，无法在如此嘈杂和困难的情况下运作。</p>
<p>With your eyes open and your ears open, you are engaged in seeing: looking on the outside, listening on the inside and the outside, all together. Like an eagle perched on the top of a great tree, you are watching and listening, and you are very still inside.</p>
<p>睁开双眼，竖起双耳，你全神贯注地观察：观察外面，倾听里面和外面，一切都融为一体。就像一只鹰栖息在一棵大树的顶端，你观察着，倾听着，而你的内心却非常平静。</p>
<p>You do not even know what you are looking for, so let that all be set aside, that concern and consideration. You do not know what you are listening for yet, so set aside that concern and consideration.</p>
<p>你甚至不知道你在寻找什么，所以把那些担忧和考虑都放在一边。你还不知道你在聆听什么，所以把那些担忧和考虑都放在一边。</p>
<p>Practice listening for short periods at the outset. In the study of Steps to Knowledge, you can practice upon the hour, for moments, looking and listening. You can do this in many situations.</p>
<p>一开始练习短时间的聆听。在学习《内识进阶》时，你可以按小时练习片刻的观察和聆听。你可以在许多情况下这样做。</p>
<p>People try to see things to get things they want. They listen for things they want to hear. They are curious. They have preferences. And so they look, but they cannot see. They listen and they cannot hear because they are involved in trying to satisfy some kind of desire, or indulge in some kind of fear.</p>
<p>人们试图通过去看得到他们想要的东西。他们通过去听得到他们想听到的事情。他们是好奇的。他们是有偏好的。所以他们看，却看不见。他们听，却听不见，因为他们正试图满足某种欲望，或者沉溺于某种恐惧。</p>
<p>To help you develop this seeing capability, it is important to practice gazing—gazing you would do mostly indoors at the outset until you have greater skill. You focus on one simple object that has very little meaning—something that will not excite your imagination, something with which you have few associations, some ordinary object. You just watch it and practice inner listening.</p>
<p>为了帮助你培养这种观察能力，练习凝视很重要——凝视一开始主要在室内进行，直到你掌握了更多的技巧。你把注意力集中在一个没有多大意义的简单物体上——它不会激发你的想象力，你很少联想到它，一些普通的物体。你只需观察它并练习内在的聆听。</p>
<p>This is to train the mind to be still and observant, to be clear and objective. It is not a reaction to the world. You are not projecting anything upon the world. And as a result of this, the practice can be difficult at first. So you practice for short periods in different situations.</p>
<p>这是为了训练心灵保持平静和观察力，保持清晰和客观。它不是对世界的反应。你没有向世界投射任何东西。因此，练习一开始可能会很困难。所以你可以在不同的情况下练习一小段时间。</p>
<p>Practice gazing when you are alone. Practice looking and listening when you are with other people or in a quiet place.</p>
<p>独自一人时练习凝视。与其他人在一起或在安静的地方时练习观察和倾听。</p>
<p>Eventually, you will be able to practice this anywhere with great efficacy.</p>
<p>最终，你将能够在任何地方非常有效地练习这一点。</p>
<p>Here you will be able to hear Knowledge speaking to you whenever it is needed and be able to be very still and comfortable in the long periods that exist between those moments when Knowledge will speak to you.</p>
<p>在这里，你将能够在需要的时候听到内识对你说话，并能够在内识对你说话的那些时刻之间的漫长时间内保持平静和舒适。</p>
<p>Many animals have great skill in being still. Think of them. They can look and listen without movement for long periods of time. This gives them immense advantages in the natural world.</p>
<p>许多动物都具有很强的静止技能。想想它们。它们可以长时间不动地观察和倾听。这给它们在自然界带来了巨大的优势。</p>
<p>Seeing has other applications as well. Once you have been developing the basic abilities, then you can take a problem or a decision and look at it and practice inner listening. Put it in front of you in your mind’s eye—or out in the open if it is something that is practical and can be visually discerned—and just look at it.</p>
<p>观察还有其他用途。一旦你培养了基本能力，你就可以面对一个问题或一个决定，观察它并练习内心倾听。用你心灵的眼睛把它放在你面前——或者如果它是实用的、可以用视觉辨别的东西，就把它放在外面——然后去看它。</p>
<p>Before you take action, before you even decide to take action, before you decide to do anything, you look at it. If it is a physical object or a project, you can walk around it and look at it—keeping your mind still and practicing inner listening.</p>
<p>在你采取行动之前，甚至在你决定采取行动之前，在你决定做任何事情之前，你都会先看看它。如果它是一个实物或一个项目，你可以绕着它走一圈，观察它——保持心灵的平静，练习内心的倾听。</p>
<p>Here you are able to discern, if you are skillful and patient in your practice, what you must do regarding this decision or this project or this situation. If it is a circumstance with other people, you can imagine it, picture it and look at it, practicing inner listening.</p>
<p>在这里，如果你在练习中熟练且有耐心，你就能辨别出对于这个决定、这个项目或这种情况你必须做什么。如果这是与其他人有关的情况，你可以想象它、描绘它并观察它，练习内心的倾听。</p>
<p>Walk around it in your own mind. Observe it from every angle, but with a quiet mind, allowing your body to be the instrument of perception it was meant to be.</p>
<p>在你自身的心灵中绕着它走一圈。从各个角度观察它，但要有一个安静的心灵，让你的身体成为感知的工具。</p>
<p>If people would do this, they would make far fewer mistakes in judgment. They would not be impelled into action in situations where they should not be involved. They would not react to other people foolishly, mindlessly. They would be more careful and discerning in how they respond to people’s situations, to opportunities and to dangers.</p>
<p>如果人们能做到这一点，他们就会少犯许多判断错误。他们不会在不该参与的情况下被迫采取行动。他们不会对其他人做出愚蠢、盲目的反应。他们会更加谨慎和明智地应对人们的处境、机会和危险。</p>
<p>When you are out in the world, you should be focused on your environment. Do not be listening to music on your headsets. Do not be talking endlessly on your telephone. Do not be dreaming and imagining, your mind far away from where you are. You must be watching and listening.</p>
<p>当你在外面的世界时，你应该关注你的环境。不要戴着耳机听音乐。不要没完没了地打电话。不要做梦和想象，让你的心灵远离你所在的地方。你必须观察和倾听。</p>
<p>When you step out the door of your home, you must be paying attention to your environment to discern what is occurring there, to discern any hazards or any changes in approach that are necessary for you.</p>
<p>当你走出家门时，你必须注意周围环境，辨别那里发生的事情，辨别任何危险或对你来说必要的方法改变。</p>
<p>If people would do this, they would make far fewer mistakes and avoid terrible catastrophes. It only takes one moment of not paying attention to end your life or to alter it completely.</p>
<p>如果人们能做到这一点，他们就会犯更少的错误，避免可怕的灾难。只需一瞬间的疏忽，就可以结束你的生命或彻底改变你的生命。</p>
<p>The animals know this. They are paying attention. People do not know this. They are not paying attention. So in spite of their greater intelligence and capabilities, they are far more prone to make foolish and unnecessary mistakes.</p>
<p>动物知道这一点。它们会留意。人们不知道这一点。他们不会留意。因此，尽管人类的智力和能力更强，但他们更容易犯下愚蠢和不必要的错误。</p>
<p>Next there is seeing at a distance, perhaps seeing a situation you are familiar with, or a place you are familiar with. That would be the easiest to practice with first.</p>
<p>接下来是远距离观察，也许是观察你熟悉的情况，或者熟悉的地方。这将是最容易练习的。</p>
<p>You bring it into your mind’s eye if it is necessary for you to perceive it, and you practice inner listening—being comfortable, sitting up straight in a quiet environment.</p>
<p>如果你有必要感知它，你就把它带入你的心灵之眼，并进行内心的倾听——保持舒适，在安静的环境中坐直。</p>
<p>If it is a physical place, in your mind’s eye you can walk around it or walk through it and just observe it according to your memory of it, but without thinking or decision making on your part.</p>
<p>如果它是一个物理位置，你可以在你的心灵中绕着它走或穿过它，并根据你的记忆来观察它，但无需进行思考或做出决定。</p>
<p>Then there is seeing something you are unfamiliar with, perhaps focusing on a country or a city far away. Perhaps something is occurring there that is a great change or a great difficulty. You can focus on this using the same skills, except that you cannot imagine it because you are not familiar with it physically. But you bring the idea of it into your mind, and you sit quietly, practicing inner listening in a quiet environment.</p>
<p>然后，你会看到一些你不熟悉的事情，也许是聚焦在遥远的一个国家或城市。也许那里正在发生一些事情，是一个巨大的变化或一个巨大的困难。你可以用同样的技巧来关注它，只是你无法想象它，因为你对它并不熟悉。但你把它的想法带入你的心灵，你静静地坐着，在安静的环境中练习内心的倾听。</p>
<p>As always when you are practicing in this manner, it is not just to get something from your subject of focus. It is to develop the skills of listening.</p>
<p>一如既往，当你以这种方式练习时，你不只是为了从你关注的话题中获得一些东西。这是为了培养倾听的技巧。</p>
<p>Perhaps you will hear something unrelated to what you are looking at, something you need to know, so instead of thinking about it, you write it down. Make note of it for later focus and consideration.</p>
<p>也许你会听到一些与你正在看的内容无关的事情，一些你需要知道的事情，所以你不必去想它，而是把它写下来。记下来，以便以后集中注意力和考虑。</p>
<p>If it is something that requires a more immediate attention, then you bring your seeing and listening to it. You listen and you watch.</p>
<p>如果某件事需要更紧急的关注，那么你就要用心观察和聆听。你要倾听和观察。</p>
<p>People and situations reveal reality to you if you are present to see it and if you can respond to Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>如果你亲眼见证，并且能够对你自己内在的内识做出回应，那么人们和各种情况就会向你揭示现实。</p>
<p>There is too much doing and not enough listening, not enough seeing, not enough being present to people, situations and experiences.</p>
<p>做得太多，听的不够，看的不够，对人、对情况、对经历的关注不够。</p>
<p>Therefore, people are in motion, but they do not know where they are going. They are involved, but they do not know what they are doing. They are engaged with others, but they do not understand the engagement. They are having experiences, but they cannot discern the meaning of these experiences. They have companions, but they do not know their companions. They are spending time doing things, but the time is not being utilized wisely or effectively.</p>
<p>因此，人们在运动，但他们不知道他们要去哪里。他们参与，但他们不知道他们在做什么。他们与他人参与，但他们不理解这种参与。他们拥有体验，但他们无法辨识这些体验的意义。他们有同伴，但他们不知道他们的同伴。他们花时间做事，但时间没有得到明智或有效的善用。</p>
<p>Next there is watching your own experience, particularly if you are stimulated by something strongly. Something evokes desire in you or excitement, or something evokes fear or rejection. In the practice of meditation, you can sit and use this seeing and listening approach to your own experience—watching it and listening.</p>
<p>接下来是观察你自身的体验，特别是当你受到某些强烈刺激时。某些东西会激发你的欲望或兴奋，或者会引起你的恐惧或排斥。在冥想练习中，你可以坐下来，用这种观察和倾听的方式来观察你自身的体验——观察和倾听。</p>
<p>Here you step back from the mind. It is not who you are. You step back from your thoughts. They are not your deeper thoughts. You step back from the images and the imaginings, the thoughts, the feelings, the fantasies—everything. Let them pass by you, and you watch them objectively.</p>
<p>在这里，你远离心灵。它不是你。你远离你的思想。它们不是你更深层次的思想。你远离图像和想象、思想、感觉、幻想——一切。让它们从你身边经过，你客观地观察它们。</p>
<p>If you are practicing stillness meditation, such as in Steps to Knowledge, and you cannot still your mind, it is best then to practice this observation—watching your thoughts pass like a parade, letting the mind do whatever it wants to do, and listening deeply within yourself.</p>
<p>如果你正在练习静止冥想，例如在《内识进阶》中，而你无法平静你的心灵，那么最好练习这种观察——观察你的思想像游行一样经过，让心灵做任何它想做的事情，并深深地倾听你自己的内心。</p>
<p>You are bringing the same practice here to your inner world, to the stream of consciousness. It is particularly important at times when you are aroused, either positively or negatively, to step back and watch this and practice inner listening.</p>
<p>你把同样的练习带入了你的内心世界，带入了意识流。当你被激发时，无论是积极的还是消极的，退后一步观察这一点并练习内心的倾听尤为重要。</p>
<p>So you see here, the art of seeing applies to your outer world. It applies to things you are familiar with and things you are not familiar with. It applies to your engagement with others, and your activities in the world, and what you do with your mind from moment to moment.</p>
<p>因此你看，观察的艺术适用于你的外部世界。它适用于你熟悉的事物和不熟悉的事物。它适用于你与他人的交往、你在世界上的活动以及你时时刻刻用你的心灵做的事情。</p>
<p>For the mind to serve you truly, as it was designed to do, then you must either be practicing this kind of presence of mind, or being present to the mind and to your outer and inner worlds, or the mind is at rest or engaged in a simple and beneficial activity. These three things give the mind reprieve and also develop its greater abilities.</p>
<p>为了让心灵真正地为你服务，正如它被设计的那样，那么你必须要么练习这种存在，要么专注于心灵和你的外部和内部世界，要么心灵处于休息状态或从事简单而有益的活动。这三件事让心灵得到缓解，并发展它更伟大的能力。</p>
<p>Why is it that a developed person can look into your mind and discern your motivations, but you cannot look into theirs and do the same? It is because they are more present and focused upon you than you are upon them, and they have developed these greater powers of mind.</p>
<p>为什么一个已经发展的人能够洞察你的心灵，分辨你的动机，而你却无法洞察他们的心灵，做同样的事情呢？这是因为他们比你更关注你，更专注于你，他们已经开发出了这些更强大的心灵力量。</p>
<p>In the Greater Community of life in the universe around you, there are races who have developed these skills to a very high level. It is not that they are more basically intelligent than you are. It is just that this has been a major focus and a major need.</p>
<p>在你们周围宇宙的生命大社区中，有些种族已经将这些技能发展到了非常高的水平。这并不是说他们比你们更聪慧。只是它已经成为一个主要焦点和主要需求。</p>
<p>When you are engaging with different races in the universe, you must be very discerning. Language is a problem. You are dealing with other kinds of consciousnesses, other kinds of values and ethics. You are dealing with beings who think differently, live according to different principles, have different experiences and have had to face different things in their history.</p>
<p>当你与宇宙中不同种族的生命打交道时，你必须非常敏锐。语言是一个问题。你面对的是其他类型的意识、其他类型的价值观和道德观。你面对的是思维方式不同、生活原则不同、经历不同、历史上不得不面对不同事物的生命。</p>
<p>How will you ever be able to communicate with them effectively? How will you ever be able to understand them or perceive them correctly? How will you ever be able to know their true motives and abilities?</p>
<p>你怎么能与他们进行有效沟通？你怎么能理解他们或正确地看待他们？你怎么能知道他们真正的动机和能力？</p>
<p>It would take a great presence of mind and highly developed skills to be able to do this. But if humanity is to function in this Greater Community environment, it must elevate its abilities in this regard, especially for those individuals who are destined to become real seers, which is a very important role in engaging with the Greater Community.</p>
<p>要做到这一点，需要很强的镇定力和高度发达的技能。但是如果人类要在这个大社区环境中运作，它必须提升这方面的能力，特别是对于那些注定要成为真正先知的个体来说，这是参与大社区的一个非常重要的角色。</p>
<p>Here the individual probably has natural inclinations and endowment that gives them a greater advantage in this matter, but they still must train and prepare—a training and preparation very different from anything taught in your universities or educational institutions. They take these basic skills into all the arenas of application and elevate them to a very high degree.</p>
<p>在这里，个体或许拥有自然倾向和禀赋，这让他们在这件事上拥有更大的优势，但他们仍必须训练和准备——这种训练和准备与你们大学或教育机构教授的任何内容截然不同。他们把这些基本技能带入所有应用领域，并将它们提升到一个非常高的程度。</p>
<p>They can sit for days, focusing on something, only taking time for rest and nourishment. They can hear things that you cannot hear and see things you cannot see and discern the motivations and the influences in the mental environment, things that you could not recognize because their range of sight is deep and their presence of mind is powerful and their engagement with Knowledge is strong.</p>
<p>他们可以连续几天坐着，专注于某件事，只花时间休息和补充营养。他们可以听到你听不到的事情，看到你看不到的事情，辨别心理环境中的动机和影响，那些你无法识别的事情，因为他们的视野是有深度的，他们的心灵是强大的，他们与内识的参与是紧密的。</p>
<p>They can see farther and hear more. They are extremely patient. It might take days or weeks or months to have a final recognition regarding something important. But they will be present for that.</p>
<p>他们看得更远，听得更多。他们非常有耐心。对于重要的事情，可能需要几天、几周或几个月才能最终得到认知。但他们会为此而存在。</p>
<p>As it is today, people cannot sit still for five seconds without becoming nervous or aggravated or emerging into fantasy or daydreaming.</p>
<p>如今，人们静坐五秒钟都会感到紧张或烦躁，或者陷入幻想或做白日梦。</p>
<p>But you see, true seeing and hearing are not reserved for the exceptional individual. It is not a specialization that only a few people should or could exercise.</p>
<p>但是你看，真正的视觉和听觉并非是少数人的专利。它并不是只有少数人才能掌握的专业技能。</p>
<p>It is what you need to discern the meaning of your engagements with others; to discern your deeper understanding, thoughts and needs; to recognize where your life is going and the degree to which you are going there; to discern the meaning of all your present and future engagements with others; to discern the value of opportunities and whether they should be taken or not; to discern what is going on in your environment, in your town, your city and your nation to see how the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world are affecting people even at this moment and affecting the circumstances and opportunities around you.</p>
<p>它是你分辨你和他人参与的意义所需要的；分辨你更深层次的理解、思想和需求所需要的；认知你的生命将走向何方以及你走向那里的程度所需要的；分辨你所有现在和未来和他人参与的意义所需要的；分辨机会的价值以及是否应该抓住它们所需要的；分辨你的环境、你的城镇、你的城市和你的国家里正在发生什么所需要的；看清正在降临世界的变革巨浪如何影响着甚至此刻的人们并影响着你周遭的境况和机会所需要的。</p>
<p>Everything you truly need and require in life becomes then the product of seeing and hearing and responding appropriately—great patience, great perseverance, stillness, objectivity, compassion and the ability to separate yourself from your own fear, to observe it to see if the fear is genuine and authentic, if it is giving you a warning, or if it is simply an indulgence of the mind.</p>
<p>然后，你在生命中真正需要和要求的一切都将成为看到、听到并做出适当回应的产物——伟大的耐心、伟大的毅力、静止、客观、同情心和将你自己与恐惧分开的能力，观察它以确定恐惧是否真实可信，它是否在给你一个警告，或者它是否只是心灵的一种放纵。</p>
<p>Everyone experiences fear. In fact, fear is the basis of most people’s thinking, desires and preoccupations. If they could separate themselves from this fear and discern what is real fear, what is actually a sign of warning and everything else that is simply an anxiety about future loss and the desire to win over others’ approval to prevent future loss, the difference in their experience of life would be profound. It is like the difference between night and day, the difference between Heaven and Hell.</p>
<p>每个人都会经历恐惧。事实上，恐惧是大多数人的思维、欲望和关注点的基础。如果他们能够摆脱这种恐惧，辨别出什么是真正的恐惧，什么实际上是警告的信号，以及所有其他只是对未来损失的焦虑和为了避免未来损失而赢得他人认可的愿望，那么他们的生命体验将会发生巨大的变化。它就像黑夜与白天的区别，天堂和地狱的区别。</p>
<p>If you can practice seeing and hearing in the arenas We have described, practicing increasingly, daily, developing the time and the approach for yourself given your circumstances, you would be able to experience a greater peace and equanimity and freedom from the oppression of your thinking and the thinking of others, even the thinking of your culture and nation. This is freedom, and it gives you equanimity, clarity and the powers of discernment and discretion.</p>
<p>如果你能在我们所描述的领域中练习看和听，每天不断练习，根据你的情况为你自己开发时间和方法，你将能够体验到更伟大的和平、平静和自由，摆脱你的思维和他人思维的压迫，甚至摆脱你的文化和国家思维的压迫。这就是自由，它给你平静、清晰和辨别力和判断力。</p>
<p>When you are with others, practice listening to them—not just to their words and gestures, but to their real intentions and what they are trying to communicate through their words and gestures, which is often very different from what they are actually saying on the outside. You watch, and you practice inner listening.</p>
<p>当你和其他人在一起时，练习倾听他们——不只是他们的言语和手势，还要倾听他们的真实意图以及他们试图通过言语和手势传达的信息，这些往往与他们实际在外表上说的话大相径庭。你观察，练习内心的倾听。</p>
<p>This is a complete change in how you engage with the world and with other people. It is a complete shift to a different way of being, to a more natural way of being, to a more powerful and efficacious way of being.</p>
<p>这完全改变了你与世界和他人打交道的方式。这是向另一种存在方式的彻底转变，向更自然的存在方式的彻底转变，向更强大、更有效的存在方式的彻底转变。</p>
<p>When you are speaking, practice listening deeper within yourself to see if your words are necessary, to see if you are communicating what should be communicated in that moment, to see if you should speak at all, and if so, what is it that should be said in this engagement with people?</p>
<p>当你说话的时候，练习更深层次地倾听你自己的内心，看看你所说的话是否必要，看看你是否传达了那一刻应该传达的内容，看看你是否应该说话，如果应该，那么在与人交往时应该说些什么？</p>
<p>If you are looking and listening, you can discern the dynamics of any human engagement, the quality of people’s approach and the degree of their honesty. You can discern their condition compassionately. You can discern even their readiness to learn of greater things. You can discern whether you should speak or not, whether you should offer something or not, whether you should change the conversation or not.</p>
<p>如果你观察并倾听，你就能辨别出人类交往的动态、人们态度的品质以及他们的诚实程度。你可以富有同情心地辨别出他们的状况。你甚至可以辨别出他们是否愿意学习更伟大的事情。你可以辨别出你是否应该说话，你是否应该提供一些东西，你是否应该改变谈话的内容。</p>
<p>Here you are not compelled to talk out of a need for social recognition. You break these bonds, these compulsions, these habits, these addictions by practicing the art of seeing.</p>
<p>在这里，你不必为了获得社会认可而被迫说话。通过练习观察的艺术，你可以打破这些束缚、这些冲动、这些习惯、这些成瘾。</p>
<p>Steps to Knowledge will give you the pathway to develop these greater skills. And you need them. You need them now. You needed them yesterday. You have needed them all along.</p>
<p>内识进阶将为你提供发展这些更伟大技能的途径。而你需要它们。你现在需要它们。你昨天需要它们。你一直都需要它们。</p>
<p>But your education has taught you to think of things that have little value and to follow other people around as if you were part of a herd of cattle, to think in step with others, and to become obsessed and engaged in the social discourse, however meaningless and immature it might have been.</p>
<p>但是，你所受的教育教会你去思考那些没什么价值的事情，去跟随别人，就像你是牛群中的一员一样，去与他人步调一致地思考，去痴迷并参与社会讨论，不管它有多么毫无意义和不成熟。</p>
<p>Now you are stepping back. Practice in the quiet of your room or your closet. Practice in a quiet place out in the city or the town, or seek a quiet place in nature to begin to develop these greater skills that are so necessary for living a meaningful and purposeful life.</p>
<p>现在你退后了一步。在安静的房间或衣柜里练习。在城市或城镇中安静的地方练习，或在大自然中寻找一个安静的地方，开始培养这些对过上有意义和有目的的生命至关重要的技能。</p>
<p>You gain skill as you practice. Seek the assistance of someone who is practicing and is more advanced than you, if that is possible.</p>
<p>练习可以让你获得技能。如果可能的话，向比你更成熟的人寻求帮助。</p>
<p>Know that you cannot teach yourself. You must practice using a greater curriculum, a greater guidance and a higher quality of engagement with at least one other person.</p>
<p>要知道，你无法教导你自己。你必须使用更丰富的课程、更好的指导和更高质量的参与，至少与另一个人一起练习。</p>
<p>Think of the Messenger and what he must practice. Share his practice.</p>
<p>思考信使及其必须实践的事情。分享他的实践。</p>
<p>Think of the needs of your life and the power that the art of seeing can bring to you in bringing God’s Grace and Strength into your affairs.</p>
<p>思考你生命中的需求，以及观察的艺术可以给你带来的力量，将上帝的恩典和力量带入你的事务中。</p>
<p>Certain problems in life must be figured out intellectually, particularly dealing with technology or mechanical things, practical things. But first, like the wise carpenter, you must look and see what the situation requires. You look and see before you act. You do not just dive into the situation unless it is an emergency.</p>
<p>生命中的某些问题必须用智力来解决，尤其是处理技术或机械问题、实际问题。但首先，像明智的木匠一样，你必须观察并看到情况需要什么。在采取行动之前，你要先观察并了解情况。除非情况紧急，否则不要一头扎进情况之中。</p>
<p>Seeing and hearing are skills of far greater value than any practical skills you can develop and will give greater direction and greater power and efficacy to any practical skills that you develop, following the art of seeing.</p>
<p>视觉和听觉是比你可以开发的任何实践技能更有价值的技能，并且将为你遵循观察的艺术所开发的任何实践技能提供更大的方向、更大的力量和效力。</p>
<p>Many questions will arise regarding these things. Write them down. Ask for assistance. Practice the art of seeing regarding them. Have a wise companion, if you can find one soon, who can review your conclusions to see if they are sound—sound at the level of Knowledge.</p>
<p>关于这些事情会出现很多问题。把它们写下来。寻求帮助。练习观察它们的艺术。如果你能很快找到一位明智的同伴，他可以审查你的结论，看看它们是否正确——在内识层面上是否正确。</p>
<p>Do not worry what other people are doing. Do not concern yourself with the state of mind of the general public. You are being called to undertake a greater preparation in service not only to yourself and your family, but really in service to the whole world.</p>
<p>不要担心其他人在做什么。不要关心大众的心灵状态。你被要求进行更充分的准备，不仅为你自己和家人服务，还要为整个世界服务。</p>
<p>For these greater skills must be developed by enough people for humanity to apprehend, discern and prepare for the great change that is coming to the world and for its encounter with a universe of intelligent life, where the powers of seeing and the powers of influence are far greater than what humanity can exert upon itself.</p>
<p>因为这些更伟大的技能必须被足够多的人发展，以便人类能够领悟、辨识并进行准备，应对即将降临世界的伟大变革，应对它与一个智能生命宇宙的相遇，在那里洞察的力量和影响力远超人类能对它自身施加的力量。</p>
<p>You need to be liberated from your mundane and confused life. You must be freed for a greater experience and ultimately a greater involvement in a world that is changing fundamentally.</p>
<p>你需要从平凡而困惑的生命中解放出来。你必须获得自由，才能获得更伟大的体验，并最终更好地参与到这个正在发生根本性变化的世界中来。</p>
