<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 13, 1994 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1994 年 10 月 13 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you have relationships within the world, you have relationships beyond the world. In the world, you have your worldly family that has raised you from infancy so that you may have the opportunity to become an adult and find the greater threshold where the second stage of life may be initiated and begun.</p>
<p>正如你在这个世界上有关系，你在这个世界之外也有关系。在这个世界上，你有你的世俗家庭，他们把你从襁褓中抚养长大，这样你就有机会成为一个成年人，找到更伟大的门槛，在那里生命的第二阶段可以开始并展开。</p>
<p>Beyond the world you have a Spiritual Family that raises you up. Their work with you becomes active as you begin the second great stage of development. Here you must begin as an infant, just the way you began as an infant when you came into this world. Here you learn to rely upon them to raise you up, to give you what you need, to orient you towards your new life and to give you the resources that you will require.</p>
<p>在世界之外，你有一个精神家庭抚养你。当你开始第二个伟大的发展阶段时，他们与你的合作就变会得活跃起来。在这里你必须从婴儿开始，就像你刚来到这个世界时一样。在这里​​你学会依靠他们抚养你，给予你你需要的内识，引导你走向你的新生命，并给你你将需要的资源。</p>
<p>The Unseen Ones oversee this development and act as an intermediary between your Spiritual Family and you while you are in the world. Here you are literally beginning a new life, and you must begin as a beginner, like an infant, like a little child. If you think you are mature and that you have learned enough already in order to embark on this second great stage of life, you will be greatly mistaken and greatly disappointed, and the mistakes you make will have serious consequences for you.</p>
<p>不可见者监管着这个发展，并在你身处世间时充当着你和你的精神家庭之间的中介。在这里，你确实正在开始一种新的生命，你必须作为一名初学者开始，像一个婴儿，像一个小孩。如果你认为你已经成熟，已经学到了足够多的东西来踏上生命的第二个伟大阶段，那么你将大错特错，大失所望，你犯下的错误将给你带来严重后果。</p>
<p>It is truly dangerous when people think they know and they do not know. This leads to many mistakes and many tragedies as well. Do not think you know. You either know or you do not know, and if you know, your Knowledge is pervasive. If what you know is real, others will resonate with Knowledge with you, and you will not have to persuade them.</p>
<p>当人们认为他们知道而实际上并不知道时，这确实很危险。这会导致许多错误，也会导致许多悲剧。不要认为你知道。你要么知道，要么不知道，如果你知道，你的内识就是无所不在的。如果你所知道的是真实的，其他人就会用内识与你产生共鸣，你就不必去说服他们。</p>
<p>To begin the second stage of life as an infant, as a beginner, as a beginning practitioner of Knowledge, you require a new kind of relationship—a relationship with a focus that is in keeping with the great stage upon which you are embarking. Here your Spiritual Family becomes more active, and those who are seeking to find you, who were sent by your Spiritual Family, will be called to you, for you need them now, and you will rely upon them in the future. And they need you now, and they will rely upon you in the future. Neither of you can be successful apart. You need each other. This is the great relationship that you yearn for, but until you begin the second great stage of life, you are not ready for it. For this is not a romance. This is not a mating game. This is something much greater and much more complete.</p>
<p>为了以一个婴儿、一个初学者、一个内识的初级践行者的身份开始生命的第二阶段，你需要一种新的关系——一种与你正在开启的伟大阶段相一致的专注的关系。在这里，你的精神家庭变得更加活跃，那些寻求找到你的人、那些被你的精神家庭派遣的人，将被召唤到你身边，因为你现在需要他们，你未来将依赖他们。他们现在需要你，他们未来将依赖你。你们两者都无法单独成功。你们彼此需要。这是你渴望的伟大关系，但直到你开始生命的第二伟大阶段之前，你还没有为它做好准备。因为这不是一场浪漫。这不是一场交配游戏。这是一种更伟大、更完整的关系。</p>
<p>You come to this second great stage because the world has disappointed you and because you come to realize that you need a greater calling and a greater reality in order to find your place and your work in the world. You also come to realize that you need greater relationships. You need dedication. You need to devote yourself. And you need to be around people who are capable of devoting themselves to you. You need a new education, and you need a new beginning. This realization does not come all at once. It comes in stages, and you will not likely realize the moment when you cross that invisible line. But after a time you begin to feel differently. Your values are changing. Your orientation is changing. What you seek in life is different from what you had sought before.</p>
<p>你之所以来到这第二个伟大的阶段，是因为世界让你失望，因为你开始意识到你需要一个更伟大的召唤和一个更伟大的现实，以便找到你在世界上的位置和工作。你还开始意识到你需要更伟大的关系。你需要奉献。你需要全身心投入。你需要和那些能够全心全意为你付出的人在一起。你需要新的教育，你需要一个新的开始。这种领悟并不是一下子就能实现的。它是分阶段实现的，你不太可能意识到你跨越那条看不见的界线的那一刻。但一段时间后，你开始有不同的感受。你的价值观在改变。你的取向在改变。你在生命中寻求的内识与你以前寻求的东西开始不同。</p>
<p>It is at the beginning of this threshold that your Spiritual Family realizes that you are ready to start. They know you are not complete. They know you are not advanced. They know you are weak and vulnerable and prone to error. But they celebrate your being able to arrive at this threshold, an accomplishment not seen by many people. For you, at this moment, everything seems confused. You are like the trapeze artist who is between the two bars. You cannot go back where you were, but you have not yet landed where you need to be. You are in between, and things can seem very confusing.</p>
<p>正是在这个门槛的开始，你的精神家庭意识到你已经准备好开始了。他们知道你并不完整。他们知道你并不先进。他们知道你软弱、脆弱、容易犯错。但他们庆祝你能够到达这个门槛，这是许多人看不到的成就。此时此刻，对你来说，一切都显得扑朔迷离。你就像一个空中飞人，游走在两个栏杆之间。你无法回到原来的地方，但你还没有到达你需要到达的地方。你处于两者之间，一切都显得非常混乱。</p>
<p>At this stage, because you are at a new beginning and because you are calling upon your Spiritual Family, your relationship with your human family will change, for you are changing now, and what you need they cannot provide. In a sense, you are not their child or their brother or their sister anymore. Though you can accept that role up to a point, you are now a child of your Spiritual Family. You are at a new beginning. Life will give you some distance from your blood family to give you this freedom to start anew. You must leave them for a time to have this freedom and to be able to think clearly for yourself without their influence. Yet do not deny or reject them. They are like the first stage of the rocket. They have gotten you here. Be grateful for all the love and all the pain, for all the errors and for all the problems. They have given you the opportunity to develop character and capacity, and they have launched you into the world. Your parents, your siblings—if you have siblings—your other relatives—they have been the nest. And now you must leave the nest. Now you must find a new foundation and a new network of relationships that represent your future and your destiny.</p>
<p>在这个阶段，因为你正处于一个新的起点，因为你在召唤你的精神家庭，你与人类家庭的关系将会改变，因为你现在正在改变，而你需要的内识他们无法提供。从某种意义上说，你不再是他们的孩子、兄弟或姐妹了。虽然你可以在一定程度上接受这个角色，但你现在是你精神家庭的孩子。你正处于一个新的起点。生命会让你与你的血亲保持一定的距离，让你有重新开始的自由。你必须离开他们一段时间，才能拥有这种自由，才能在没有他们影响的情况下清晰地思考。然而，不要否认或拒绝他们。他们就像火箭的第一级。他们把你带到了这里。感谢所有的爱和所有的痛苦，感谢所有的错误和所有的问题。他们给了你发展品格和能力的机会，他们把你送进了这个世界。你的父母、你的兄弟姐妹——如果你有兄弟姐妹的话——你的其他亲戚——他们就是你的巢穴。现在你必须离开这个巢穴。现在你必须找到一个新的基础和一个新的关系网络来代表你的未来和你的天命。</p>
<p>During this period of transition, you will have relationships that represent this transition—very close associations with people who will only be in your life temporarily, but will be catalysts to help you bridge the gap between your old life and your new life. Some will help you, and some will try to take advantage of you. But if seen clearly, you can use your experience with them to enable you to step into a new arena. You will meet people in a very similar stage as yourself, and you will also meet people who think they are in the stage you are in, but in reality they are not there. You will find help and hindrance respectively here. But you are clearly moving into a new arena.</p>
<p>在这个过渡时期，你会拥有代表这种过渡的关系——与那些只是暂时出现在你生命中的人建立非常密切的联系，但他们将成为催化剂，帮助你弥合旧的生命和新的生命之间的差距。有些人会帮助你，有些人会试图利用你。但是，如果清晰的看到，你就可以使用你与他们的经历，使你自己步入一个新的领域。你会遇到和你处于非常相似阶段的人，也会遇到自以为处于你所处阶段的人，但实际上他们并不在你所处的阶段。在这里，你会分别找到帮助和阻碍。但很明显，你正在进入一个新的领域。</p>
<p>You have become a person in the world. Congratulations! Now you are ready to begin the next great stage, and that is to become a man or a woman of Knowledge. You cannot take your former learning with you. You must start as a beginner. That is why when you begin the study of Steps to Knowledge and when you begin to build the foundation for learning and living The Way of Knowledge, you start as a beginner—someone who is starting out anew, someone who is entering new territory that is unfamiliar. Yes, the geography looks the same and even the people can look the same, but the experience and the emphasis are different now.</p>
<p>你已经成为世界上的一个人。祝贺你！现在你已经准备好开始下一个伟大的阶段，那就是成为一个内识的男人或女人。你不能把你以前的学习带走。你必须从一个初学者开始。这就是为什么当你开始学习内识进阶，当你开始构建学习和生活在内识之路的基础时，你是从一个初学者开始的——一个重新出发的人，一个进入陌生的新领域的人。是的，地理看起来一样，甚至人看起来也一样，但现在的经验和重点不同了。</p>
<p>Your Spiritual Family will raise you up, those beyond the world and those within the world as well. They are your parents, your brothers and your sisters now, and The Unseen Ones are your elders who guide and oversee your development. Because you do not live together in a state of Knowledge, they must help you. Though you will rarely experience them directly, they will work behind the scenes on your behalf. That is not to say they will take away every obstacle and risk from your life. Of course not. But they will seek to give you the greatest opportunity to face problems, obstacles and risks effectively and successfully. They will help you negotiate the world. They will stand behind your true decisions, and they will send warnings and messages when you make decisions that are not correct. Your Spiritual Family will take you to your greater purpose, for that is their mission.</p>
<p>你的精神家庭将抚养你，那些超越世界的存在，也包括那些身处世界的存在。他们现在是你的父母、你的兄弟姐妹，不可见者是你的长辈，他们指导和监督你的发展。因为你们并非共同生活在内识状态中，所以他们必须帮助你。尽管你很少直接体验他们，但他们将在幕后为你工作。这并不是说他们会带走你生命中的每一个障碍和风险。当然不是。但是他们将寻求给你最大的机会，让你有效和成功地面对问题、障碍和风险。他们将帮助你应对世界。他们将支持你真正的决定，当你做出不正确的决定时，他们将发出警告和讯息。你的精神家庭将带你走向你的更伟大目的，因为这是他们的使命。</p>
<p>What is a Spiritual Family? Our explanation for this cannot be complete because Spiritual Family is an experience and not a definition. Let us say for the purpose of clarification that your Spiritual Family represents a small learning group that has been developed over a long time. At your stage of development, you work best in small groups. That is why your Spiritual Family represents a small group. Not all of your Spiritual Family live within this world. Some of them exist in the Greater Community. Not all of your development has been in this world because you yourself have had experiences of the Greater Community.</p>
<p>什么是精神家庭？我们对此的解释并不完整，因为精神家庭是一种体验，而不是一种定义。为了澄清起见，我们假设你的精神家庭代表一个经过长期发展的小型学习小组。在你的发展阶段，你在小组中工作效果最好。这就是为什么你的精神家庭代表一个小型团体。并非所有的精神家庭成员都生活在这个世界中。他们中的一些成员存在于大社区之中。并非你的所有发展都发生在这个世界中，因为你自己有过大社区的经历。</p>
<p>Your Spiritual Family lives beyond the physical, in a spiritual reality. They are active in the world though they cannot intervene directly. Only if they come into the world and emerge here and live within the physical reality can they play a direct role. This speaks of your emergence into the world and the greater purpose that you have brought with you, which is as yet unknown to you.</p>
<p>你的精神家庭生活在物质之外，生活在一个精神现实中。他们活跃在世界上，尽管他们无法直接干预。只有当他们来到这个世界、出现在这里并生活在物质现实中时，他们才能发挥直接的作用。这说明你来到这个世界，以及你带来的更伟大目的，这对你来说仍是未知的。</p>
<p>The Unseen Ones can function within a transition zone between spiritual reality and physical reality. They can influence the mental environment, and they will have an influence on your thinking—a very important influence to help you to strengthen your resolution and to counsel and correct you when you are in error. They will do this without becoming the object of your attention, for they understand that they must remain hidden if you are to find your own way. For if you should recognize them directly, you would simply seek to be with them at all times, as a child would seek to be with their guardian at all times. Yet they are preparing you for the world, and they must prepare you to venture into the world. You venture into the world well equipped and well prepared, for Knowledge is with you now and your Spiritual Family is with you.</p>
<p>不可见者能够在精神现实与物质现实之间的过渡区内运作。他们能够影响心理环境，他们将影响你的思维——一种非常重要的影响，它帮助你加强你的决心，并在你犯错时辅导和纠正你。他们将做到这一点，但不会成为你关注的对象，因为他们理解，如果你要找到你自身的道路，他们就必须保持隐匿。因为如果你直接认出他们，你就会简单地寻求始终与他们在一起，就像一个孩子寻求始终与他们监护人在一起一样。然而他们正在为你们准备世界，他们必须为你们准备冒险进入世界。你在充分装备和充分准备的情况下冒险进入世界，因为内识现在与你同在，你的精神家庭与你同在。</p>
<p>One of the most important developments you will have in your relationships is the development of discernment and discretion. Discernment is knowing what you are seeing. Discretion is knowing what you are saying and what you are doing. At the outset, people think that anyone they feel close to and anyone they like is automatically a member of their Spiritual Family and somehow represents one of the key individuals in their lives. But these estimations are often wrong. Only contrast will show you the difference between someone with whom you experience personal affinity and someone who represents a member of your Spiritual Family.</p>
<p>你在关系中最重要的发展之一就是培养辨别力和谨慎。辨别力就是知道你看到了什么。谨慎就是知道你在说什么和在做什么。一开始，人们认为他们感觉亲近的任何人和他们喜欢的任何人自动都是他们精神家庭的成员，并以某种方式代表了他们生命中的关键人物之一。但这些估计往往是错误的。只有对比才能让你看到与你有个人亲和力的人和代表你精神家庭成员的人之间的区别。</p>
<p>You are looking for your Family. Now you need them. They are looking for you. Now they need you. For if you have been developing adequately, you will come upon your great thresholds in life around the same time. You will come to great conclusions generally around the same time. If one of you falters or fails, the others will be held back. This is how important these relationships are, and this is how important your responsibility as a student of Knowledge is, for you work for your own behalf and you work for your Spiritual Family. Your success is for them, and your failure is for them as well.</p>
<p>你在寻找你的家人。现在你需要他们。他们在寻找你。现在他们需要你。因为如果你们一直得到充分发展，你们将在大约同一时间到达你们生命的伟大门槛。你们将大致在同一时间得出伟大结论。如果你们其中一人动摇或失败，其他人就会受到阻碍。这些关系如此重要，你作为内识学生的责任如此重要，因为你为你自身而工作，你为你的精神家庭而工作。你的成功是为了他们，你的失败也是为了他们。</p>
<p>Do not feel this is a great burden because in essence this will give you the strength to carry on, for if your development in the second great stage of life were for yourself alone, you would not have the strength or the incentive to do it. It is only when you are responsible to something greater and for something greater that you find the inner resources and the great encouragement you need to carry on. Remember, this is a stage where you emerge from being an individual to recognizing that you are a part of a greater order of life. The Way of Knowledge is oriented to preparing you for this intrinsic relationship.</p>
<p>不要觉得这是一个沉重的负担，因为从本质上讲，这将赋予你继续前行的力量，因为如果你在生命的第二个伟大阶段的发展只是为了你自己，你就没有力量或动力去做这件事。只有当你对更伟大的事情负责，为了更伟大的事情而负责时，你才能找到继续前行所需的内在资源和伟大鼓励。记住，在这个阶段，你从一个个体走出来，认识到你是生命更伟大秩序的一部分。内识之路旨在让你为这种固有关系做好准备。</p>
<p>You seek affinity with others in the world because that is your natural state, but only with those who represent your Spiritual Family will you be able to experience this completely. That is because their purpose and their message in the world corresponds with yours.</p>
<p>你寻求与世界上的其他人建立亲和力，因为这是你的自然状态，但只有与那些代表你的精神家庭的人在一起，你才能完全体验到这一点。这是因为他们在这个世界上的目的和讯息与你相一致。</p>
<p>If you live at the surface of life, if you are dominated by your thoughts and beliefs, you will not be able to fathom this great understanding, and you will assign the idea or the role of Spiritual Family to anyone to whom you feel a great attraction or resonance. But students of Knowledge can see beyond these initial mistakes and can look more carefully and more completely. They will be more prudent and less reckless in their observations of others. And their success in exercising their discernment will become greater and stronger in time.</p>
<p>如果你活在生命的表面，如果你被你的思想和信仰所支配，你将无法领会这个伟大的理解，你将把精神家庭的想法或角色分配给任何你感到有巨大吸引力或共鸣的人。但内识的学生能够看透这些最初的错误，能够更仔细、更全面地看待。他们在观察他人时将更加谨慎、更少鲁莽。他们在运用辨识力方面的成功将随着时间的推移变得更大、更强。</p>
<p>Discretion means you know what to say and when to say it. The rest of the time, you remain silent. You are not governed now by a need to express yourself to offset your sense of inadequacy or insecurity. You realize that your words have power and that they commit you, and so you want to use them carefully. You do not want to use deception, but you want to place your words well. Words are forces in and of themselves, and once they leave your lips, they travel beyond you. And you will be held accountable for them, particularly as you gain strength.</p>
<p>谨慎意味着你知道该说什么、什么时候说。其余时间，你保持沉默。现在，你不再需要表达你自己来抵消你的不足感或不安全感。你意识到你的话语具有力量，它们会让你做出承诺，所以你想谨慎地使用它们。你不想使用欺骗，但你想把话说得恰到好处。话语本身就是一种力量，一旦它们从你的嘴唇中流出，他们就会超越你。你将为它们负责，特别是当你获得力量时。</p>
<p>Here you learn to wait as much as possible to have certainty before you make an important decision. Here you seek verification from those who can be your true allies in The Way of Knowledge. Here your decision making becomes more sound, more complete and more carefully exercised. Here you select people based upon their ability to participate with you in the most important parts of your life. You use these criteria instead of personal attraction. For you realize that no relationship can succeed if you cannot participate together, regardless of the initial experience that you might have together. Here you have an opportunity to develop real honesty within yourself. For you have the opportunity to experience, to feel and to represent what you know and to leave the parts of your life that are unclear as they are, without pretense, as if your life were a puzzle that is only partially constructed. You are careful not to fill in the spaces with your hopes and ideas. Here you are not governed by the need to make an impression upon others or to seek their approval. You are willing for your life to be incomplete because it is incomplete. And the truth is a greater companion than anything else.</p>
<p>在这里，你学会在做出重要决定之前尽可能地等待，以获得确定性。在这里，你寻求那些能够成为你在内识之路上的真正盟友的人的验证。在这里，你的决策变得更加合理、更加完整和更加谨慎。在这里，你选择人们是基于他们与你一起参与你生命中最重要的部分的能力。你使用这些标准，而不是个人吸引力。因为你意识到，如果你们不能一起参与，那么任何关系都不可能成功，无论你们最初在一起的经历如何。在这里，你有机会发展你内心的真正诚实。因为你有机会体验、感受和表达你所知道的内识，并让你生命中不清楚的部分保持原样，不加掩饰，仿佛你的生命是一个只部分构建的谜题。你小心翼翼地不以你的希望和想法填补空白。在这里，你不受给他人留下印象或寻求他们认可的需要的支配。你愿意让你的生命不完整，因为它是不完整的。而真理是比任何其他事物更伟大的伴侣。</p>
<p>To begin the second great stage of life, you begin to enter the Mystery. Here you go beyond the well-worn paths that people travel, and you enter a kind of wilderness experience—a wilderness where there are trails, but you are not certain of the way, a wilderness where your parents and your siblings and your friends cannot go with you, a wilderness you must enter. Here your outer life may look the same, but you are experiencing new dimensions of life, and they seem strange and wondrous and perhaps even frightening to you. You enter here because your mind is expanding and because the reference point within you is changing. No longer can you rely upon your beliefs and assumptions. And as a result, you realize how little you really know. No longer can you rely upon the beliefs or assumptions of others, for you realize that they may know less than you.</p>
<p>要开始生命的第二个伟大阶段，你开始进入神秘。在这里，你在人们走过的陈旧道路之外，进入一种荒野体验——一种有小径但你不确定道路的荒野，一种你的父母、兄弟姐妹和朋友无法与你同行的荒野，一种你必须进入的荒野。在这里，你的外在生命可能看起来是一样的，但你正在体验生命的新维度，它们对你来说似乎陌生、奇妙，甚至可能令人恐惧。你进入这里是因为你的心灵在扩展，因为你内在的参照点正在改变。你不再能够依赖你的信仰和假设。结果，你意识到你知道的有多么少。你不再能够依赖他人的信仰或假设，因为你意识到他们可能知道的比你还要少。</p>
<p>Here you know enough to begin, but you do not assume you know any more. Here you know enough to continue onward, without assuming the result of your efforts or journey. Here you seem to travel alone because so many whom you knew before were not able to go with you. And yet you feel a Spiritual Presence in your life. Here you go where life seems open and unshielded, where pain and happiness are sharper and much more clearly experienced. And yet, before long you find others who are venturing into that wilderness as well, and they are as uncertain as you, though they may not admit it. Here you will find that those things that interested you before no longer hold appeal or attraction now. You seek quiet instead of stimulation. You seek honesty instead of charm. You seek affinity instead of attraction. You seek inspiration instead of entertainment. You seek meaning instead of escape. Something has changed within you. Somewhere mysteriously you crossed a line, and everything began to change—to change just enough that you feel you have a different orientation in your life. Here you begin to recognize that life is a mystery and that all the assumptions and all the beliefs that you had that seemed to explain and organize your experience so conveniently no longer hold true. Here there is wonderment. Here there is great expectation. Here every day is something new, rather than a dreadful repetition of the past.</p>
<p>在这里，你知道的已经足够多，可以开始，但你不会假设你知道得更多。在这里，你知道的已经足够多，可以继续前进，而不必假设你的努力或旅程的结果。在这里，你似乎是独自旅行，因为你之前认识的许多人都无法与你同行。然而，你却感受到了生命中的精神存在。在这里，你的生命似乎是开放的、没有遮蔽的，痛苦和幸福更加尖锐，体验也会更加清晰。然而，不久之后，你会发现其他人也在冒险进入这片荒野，他们和你一样不确定，尽管他们可能不会承认。在这里，你会发现那些以前让你感兴趣的事物现在不再具有魅力或吸引力。你寻求的是安静而不是刺激。你寻求的是诚实而不是魅力。你寻求的是亲和力而不是吸引力。你寻求的是灵感而不是娱乐。你寻求的是意义而不是逃避。你的内心发生了一些变化。不知何故，你越过了一条界线，一切都开始改变——改变得足以让你感觉到你的生命有了不同的方向。在这里，你开始认识到生命是一个谜，你所有那些似乎可以如此方便地解释和组织你的经历的假设和信念都不再成立。在这里，你会惊叹不已。在这里，你会满怀期待。在这里，每一天都是新的，而不是可怕的过去重复。</p>
<p>You do not walk this wilderness alone, but many of your companions are as yet unseen. Perhaps you feel them. Perhaps in the quietest moments you feel there is someone standing around you. Perhaps in a moment of anxiety or despair, you feel the graceful hand of The Unseen Ones on your shoulder.</p>
<p>你并不是独自一人行走在这片荒野，但你的许多同伴尚未出现。也许你感觉到了他们。也许在最安静的时刻，你感觉到有人站在你身边。也许在焦虑或绝望的时刻，你感觉到不可见者优雅的手放在你的肩上。</p>
<p>Once you enter the wilderness, you must continue, and if you continue, you will find great companions. You will also find dangers there as well because people are not accustomed to living without definitions, and so you will see within yourself and within others the propensity to define or to project your ideas upon your new experience. Many serious mistakes are made here as a result. Here people try to extend their past life into their present life. They try to exercise the familiarity of their old ideas with the challenge of meeting new experiences. Here you see people making grandiose assumptions about the Divine and the Divine presence and reality in their lives. Here you see people making grandiose proclamations about their abilities—calling themselves healers, calling themselves advanced practitioners, thinking that they are at the final thresholds of their learning when in reality they are beginners like you.</p>
<p>一旦你进入荒野，你就必须继续前行，如果你继续前行，你就会找到伟大的同伴。你也会在那里发现危险，因为人们不习惯没有定义的生活，所以你会发现你自己和他人都倾向于定义或将你的想法投射到你的新体验上。结果，这里会犯下许多严重的错误。在这里，人们试图将他们过去的生命延伸到现在的生命。他们试图将他们旧想法的熟悉运用到迎接新体验的挑战中。在这里，你会看到人们对他们生命中的神圣和神圣的存在和现实做出夸张的假设。在这里，你会看到人们对他们自己的能力做出夸张的宣告——称他们自己为治疗者，称他们自己为先进实践者，认为他们已经到达了学习的最后门槛，而实际上他们和你一样都是初学者。</p>
<p>There are no masters in the world. The world is not the environment for mastery. Perhaps this idea comes as a shock, but if you consider it honestly, you will see it with a great relief. The world is but a limited arena in which to experience life. There are greater arenas beyond the world in the Greater Community. You may become a proficient learner here, and you may become an advancing student of Knowledge, and this represents a very great accomplishment, we assure you. But do not call yourself a master because life is the master. Knowledge is the master. And the ability of Knowledge and the depth of Knowledge will always exceed your understanding.</p>
<p>世界上没有大师。世界不是大师的环境。也许这个想法令人震惊，但如果你诚实地思考它，你就会如释重负地看到它。世界只是一个体验生命的有限舞台。在大社区里，世界之外有更大的舞台。在这里，你可以成为一名熟练的学习者，你可以成为一名不断进步的内识学生，我们向你保证，这代表着一项非常伟大的成就。但不要称你自己为大师，因为生命才是大师。内识才是大师。内识的能力和内识的深度将永远超出你的理解。</p>
<p>Be on guard for the errors in discernment and discretion that people make when they enter the wilderness. And be on guard for those who think they are in the wilderness when in fact they are simply confused within their own minds. And be on guard for those who claim to be masters and for those who claim to be advanced. With Knowledge you will see that they are but deceived and deceiving. For what they tell themselves is incorrect, and as a result what they reveal to others is incorrect as well.</p>
<p>当人们进入荒野时，要警惕他们所犯的辨别和判断错误。要警惕那些认为他们身处荒野而实际上只是心灵混乱的人。要警惕那些自称是大师和自称是先进的人。有了内识，你就会发现他们只是被欺骗和欺骗。因为他们告诉他们自己的话是错误的，因此他们向他人透露的话也是错误的。</p>
<p>Be vulnerable in the wilderness. Be like the plants and the animals in the physical wilderness. They are vulnerable to life. They are open to life. Be vulnerable. Be alert. Be cautious but not afraid. Be careful and move slowly. Observe others. Do not condemn anyone. Take time to make your decisions, if you have time. Do not be in a hurry. Learn patiently and your learning will be solid and reliable.</p>
<p>在荒野中保持脆弱。就像荒野中的植物和动物一样。它们对生命很脆弱。它们对生命持开放态度。保持脆弱。保持警惕。小心谨慎但不要害怕。小心谨慎，慢慢行动。观察他人。不要谴责任何人。如果有时间，请花时间做决定。不要着急。耐心学习，你的学习就会扎实可靠。</p>
<p>Entering the wilderness means you are facing life without assumptions or with fewer assumptions. The mystery of life has always been there. It has simply never been experienced for more than a moment here and there. Now you are living in it. Now you are feeling it. Now you are responding to it. It is exhilarating and frightening all at once. It is a precious time, but it is a risky time as well. You must have a very sincere heart to negotiate the beginning journeys into the wilderness successfully. Many people stop by the side of the road and give up or claim they have arrived at a final juncture or make great assumptions about their abilities because they think they have come so far. But there is much further to go and there is much more to do.</p>
<p>进入荒野意味着你面对生命时不带任何假设，或者假设更少。生命的神秘一直都在那里。只是你从未在这里或那里体验过超过片刻。现在你生活在其中。现在你正在感受它。现在你正在回应它。它既令人兴奋又令人恐惧。这是一个宝贵的时刻，但也是一个危险的时刻。你必须有一颗非常真诚的心才能成功地度过进入荒野的最初旅程。许多人停在路边放弃，或者声称他们已经到达了最后的关头，或者对他们的能力做出了很大的假设，因为他们认为他们已经走了如此之远。但还有很长的路要走，还有很多事情要做。</p>
<p>When others stop, keep going. You may welcome them to join you, but if they cannot, you have to go on. You do them and yourself a disservice if you give up your journey to try and initiate theirs. You will do more for them by continuing on. This beckons them, and they will remember your demonstration.</p>
<p>当其他人停下来时，继续前行。你可以欢迎他们加入你，但如果他们不能，你必须继续前行。如果你放弃你自己的旅程，试图开启他们的旅程，那么这对他们和你自己都是一种伤害。继续前行，你会为他们做更多的事情。这会吸引他们，他们会记住你的示范。</p>
<p>The wilderness is the place between thinking and Knowledge. It is the area between a life of assumptions and a life of experience. Here everything you thought you knew becomes questioned. Here your assumptions are recognized as assumptions rather than facts or realities. Here you begin to experience new dimensions in life, and your sensitivity develops. Here you are able to hear thoughts and become exposed to the mental environment. Here you taste life’s reality much more clearly and much more sharply. Here your ambitions are tempered. Here your approach becomes humble.</p>
<p>荒野是思维与内识之间的地带。它是假设的生命与体验的生命之间的地带。在这里，你认为知道的一切都会受到质疑。在这里，你的假设被视为假设，而不是事实或现实。在这里，你开始体验生命中的新维度，你的敏感度也会得到发展。在这里，你能够倾听思想，接触心理环境。在这里，你更清晰、更敏锐地品味生命的现实。在这里，你的野心得到了缓和。在这里，你的态度变得谦逊。</p>
<p>If you proceed, your approach will become humble because reality will always exceed your evaluations. Here you realize nothing is absolute because you are in between two realities. Here you will feel your mortality and your vulnerability to life, but it is here in the wilderness that you will find Knowledge ever so clearly, for you will be open to it. You will need it, and you will call upon it because you will have to rely upon it. No longer is it a distant option. It now becomes an immediate necessity.</p>
<p>如果你继续前行，你的方法将变得谦逊，因为现实总是超出你的评估。在这里，你意识到没有什么是绝对的，因为你处在两种现实之间。在这里，你将感受到你的死亡和你对生命的脆弱，但正是在这里，在荒野中，你将如此清晰地找到内识，因为你将对它敞开心扉。你将需要它，你将召唤它，因为你将不得不依赖它。它不再是一个遥远的选择。它现在成为一种迫切的需求。</p>
<p>In the wilderness, all the voices of dissonance can whisper to you and lead you astray, but here the Unseen Ones will glide over you, and you will feel their gentle urging to go on. Here you will meet many attractive people, and you will wonder, “Should I go with them?” But you must continue on. If after a long journey they are still with you, well, only then will you know that you are meant to be together. But be careful. This evaluation can be wrongly made.</p>
<p>在荒野中，所有不和谐的声音都会对你低语，让你误入歧途，但在这里，不可见者会从你身边掠过，你会感受到他们温柔的催促，让你继续前行。在这里，你会遇到许多有吸引力的人，你会想，“我应该和他们一起去吗？”但你必须继续前行。如果经过漫长的旅程后他们仍然和你在一起，那么，只有那时你才会知道你们注定要在一起。但要小心。这种评估可能是错误的。</p>
<p>In the wilderness, you become open to Knowledge. Here you become reliant upon Knowledge. Do not fall back into safe conclusions and familiar ideas. Do not seek refuge from life. Do not close yourself off. Do not assume a new mantle of ideas, which will only become a crown of thorns for you in the future.</p>
<p>在荒野中，你对内识敞开心扉。在这里，你对内识产生依赖。不要落入安全的结论和熟悉的想法。不要逃避生命。不要封闭你自己。不要承担新的想法，这只会成为你未来的荆棘冠冕。</p>
<p>Keep moving forward. Keep taking the steps to Knowledge. Be without conclusion. Develop your abilities. Be a beginning student. Become reliant upon Knowledge. Become respectful of life’s dangers and life’s great opportunities. Become genuine with what you tell yourself and what you tell others. Be willing to appear foolish and confused. Be willing to be certain when you are certain.</p>
<p>继续前进。继续迈向内识。不要有结论。发展你的能力。做一名初学者。信赖内识。尊重生命的危险和生命的伟大机会。真诚地对待你告诉你自己和告诉他人的事情。愿意表现出愚蠢和困惑。当你确定的时候，愿意保持确定。</p>
<p>If you can do these things, you will pass through the wilderness. You will gain great strength here. You will gain great confidence here. And you will gain the assurance that your Spiritual Family is with you and that there are those in life who are truly meant to be with you and who are truly capable of understanding you and knowing you.</p>
<p>如果你能做到这些，你将穿越荒野。你将在这里获得伟大力量。你将在这里获得伟大信心。你将获得确信：你的精神家庭与你同在，生命中有人真正注定与你同在，真正能够理解你、知道你。</p>
<p>The journey is longer than you think. And you will travel more slowly than you think you can. This will require more of you than you think it will require. And it will offer more to you than you think that it can offer. And it will restore to you abilities that you never knew you had. And it will elevate and clarify those abilities that you have always felt you had. And it will bring real dedication and devotion into your relationships, for that will be their foundation.</p>
<p>旅程比你想象的要长。而你的行进速度会比你想象的要慢。这需要你付出的努力会比你想象的要多。它给你的回报也会比你想象的要多。它会恢复你从未意识到的能力。它会提升和澄清你一直认为你拥有的能力。它会给你的关系带来真正的奉献和忠诚，因为内识将是它们的基础。</p>
<p>Your Spiritual Family is awaiting you, but you must make the journey. The power of decision is yours. And the power of Knowledge is with you to help you make the right decision. But first you must make the decision, and you will have to make it again and again.</p>
<p>你的精神家庭正在等待你，但你必须踏上旅程。决定权在你手中。内识的力量与你同在，帮助你做出正确的决定。但首先你必须做出决定，你将不得不一次又一次地做出决定。</p>
<p>Enter the Mystery. Enter the wilderness. Leave the paved roads of life, which represent the popular ideas and conventional thinking that people rely upon and call reality. If you are not reckless and ambitious, you will find your way because you will be moving slowly and carefully. If you do not have great presumptions about yourself and your life, you will recognize your opportunities and the dangers along the way. If you become reliant upon Knowledge in others and Knowledge within yourself, you will have a sound foundation for real decision making, and your decisions will be lasting and effective. If you are willing to be without definition and without philosophy, without high ideals and without terrible fears, if you allow your mind to be suspended, your mind can then find its way back to Knowledge.</p>
<p>进入神秘。进入荒野。离开铺设好的生命道路，这些道路代表着人们所依赖并称之为现实的流行观念和传统思维。如果你不鲁莽，不野心勃勃，你就会找到你的道路，因为你将缓慢而谨慎地前行。如果你对你自己和你的生命没有过多的预设，你就会认识到沿途的机会和危险。如果你开始依赖他人的内识和你内在的内识，你将拥有真正决策的坚实基础，你的决策将是持久而有效的。如果你愿意没有定义，没有哲学，没有崇高的理想，没有可怕的恐惧，如果你允许你的心灵悬浮，你的心灵就能找到回归内识的道路。</p>
<p>The mind will then come to realize that it must serve and that it can only serve, and you will want it to serve because you want to serve. You want to serve others, and you want others to serve life with you. And you see there is no real sacrifice here, for all you have given up is ideas and assumptions. All you are really facing is uncertainty and mystery. Now you have a greater possibility to not only survive in the world but to flourish here and to contribute your great gifts that you have brought with you over a long journey from your Ancient Home. Now your mind becomes sharper. Your perception becomes deeper. Now you have a deep and abiding patience within you. Now you wait for certainty instead of assigning certainty. Now you wait for truth instead of declaring truth. Now you look for reality in another instead of being fooled by appearances.</p>
<p>心灵将意识到它必须服务并且它只能服务，而你将希望它服务因为你想要服务。你想要服务他人，你希望他人与你一起服务生命。你看到这里没有真正的牺牲，因为你放弃的只是想法和假设。你真正面对的只是不确定性和神秘。现在你拥有更大的可能性，不仅在世界上生存，而且在这里繁荣，并贡献你在从你的古老家园漫长旅程中带来的伟大礼物。现在你的心灵变得更加敏锐。你的感知变得更深层次。现在你内在拥有一种深度而持久的耐心。现在你等待确定性而不是指定确定性。现在你等待真理而不是宣告真理。现在你在另一个人身上寻找现实而不是被表象所愚弄。</p>
<p>Only the wilderness can teach you this. Only the wilderness can initiate your relationship with Knowledge in this life. Enter gratefully and respectfully. Keep your eyes open. Keep your mind as clear as you can. Keep your eyes focused on the present and on the future, for you cannot go back and there is nothing to go back to. Have faith that your friends and family will some day, perhaps in the distant future, understand what you are doing. And remember, you can do nothing alone. Therefore, you do not walk the wilderness alone, but you must walk the wilderness to find out who is really with you.</p>
<p>只有荒野能够教会你这一点。只有荒野能够开启你与内识在此生的关系。带着感激和尊重进入。保持你的眼睛睁开。尽可能保持你的心灵清晰。保持你的眼睛聚焦于现在和未来，因为你无法回头，也没有什么可以回头的。相信你的朋友和家人终有一天，也许在遥远的未来，会理解你在做什么。记住，你独自一人什么都做不了。因此，你并不是独自行走在荒野中，但你必须行走在荒野中，才能发现谁真正与你同在。</p>
