<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 14, 1994 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1994 年 10 月 14 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your preparation and training in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge must enable you to become present in the world. This means that your attention is keyed into what is happening at this moment and at the next moment. Here you learn to become attentive with an open mind. And as you develop, you will gain the strength and the assurance that will enable you to allow Knowledge to decide what you must do and where you must go. This represents a real advancement in The Way of Knowledge. Yet you must be very careful that you do not claim this ability for yourself prematurely, for there are many things in the world that can sway you and influence you. There are people and forces in the world that would, given the opportunity, try to capture your mind.</p>
<p>你在大社区内识之路上的准备和训练必须使你能够在场于这个世界。这意味着你的注意力集中于此刻和下一刻发生的事情。在这里，你学会以开放的心灵保持专注。随着你的发展，你将获得力量和信心，这将使你能够让内识决定你必须做什么、你必须去哪里。这代表着内识之路上的真正进步。然而你必须非常小心，不要过早地为你自己宣称这种能力，因为世界上有许多事情能够左右你、影响你。世界上有些人和势力如果有机会，就会试图俘获你的心灵。</p>
<p>Therefore, you want to be very careful in your approach. Be very careful about any assumptions that you make regarding your ability. Just because you are open does not mean that you are Divinely guided. Just because you seek greater Wisdom in your life does not mean that you are not vulnerable to other forces in the mental environment. This will become increasingly true as the world’s emergence into the Greater Community advances and progresses. That is why We spend a long time building the foundation for Knowledge, to protect you from error and to assure your future success. It is only when people are ambitious and impatient, when they seek to have the great rewards now instead of later, that they get into serious trouble.</p>
<p>因此，你要非常小心地对待你的方法。要非常小心地对待你对你能力的任何假设。仅仅因为你是开放的，并不意味着你受到了神圣的指引。仅仅因为你在生命中寻求更伟大的智慧，并不意味着你不会受到心理环境中其他力量的伤害。随着世界向大社区的迈进和进步，这一点将变得越来越真实。这就是为什么我们要花费很长时间来建立内识的基础，以保护你免于错误并确保你未来的成功。只有当人们雄心勃勃、没有耐心，当他们寻求现在而不是未来获得伟大的回报时，他们才会陷入严重的困境。</p>
<p>Many have claimed spiritual power and dominance. Many have assumed a mantle of spiritual responsibility. Others have claimed to be the true vehicles for Divine will and intention in life. Yet look at the results of their interactions. After all, everyone wants to feel that they are in the right. Even if people are doing something they know to be wrong, they want to feel justified. There are those who are certain that they are in the right and are unwilling to face the prospect that they might be in the wrong. They claim Divine sponsorship for their lives, their thoughts, their actions, and all they may attempt to do with others. Here you will find abuse. Here you will find grave error. Be careful. Become present. If you are still and observant, you will be able to see what others miss.</p>
<p>许多人声称拥有精神力量和统治地位。许多人承担了精神责任。其他人则声称他们是生命中神圣意志和意图的真正载体。然而，看看他们互动的结果。毕竟，每个人都想感觉自己是对的。即使人们在做一些他们知道是错的事情，他们也想感觉他们是正当的。有些人确信他们是对的，不愿意面对他们可能做错的前景。人们声称他们的生命、他们的思想、他们的行动以及他们可能试图与他人做的一切事情都受到神圣的赞助。在这里你会发现虐待。在这里，你会发现严重的错误。要小心。保持清醒。如果你保持冷静和观察，你就能看到他人所忽略的事情。</p>
<p>In the training in Steps to Knowledge, one of the main things you will learn and will have to reinforce over time is the ability to be still. This ability represents a fundamental skill in life. It involves becoming observant, receptive, sensitive and insightful. Here you use your mind rather than be used by it. Here you employ your mind to scan the horizon of your mental and physical environment.</p>
<p>在内识进阶的训练中，你将学到并需要随着时间的推移不断强化的主要内容之一就是保持静止的能力。这种能力代表了生命中的一项基本技能。它涉及变得善于观察、善于接受、敏感和有洞察力。在这里，你使用你的心灵而不是被它使用。在这里，你使用你的心灵来扫描你的心理环境和物理环境的范围。</p>
<p>This skill is not foreign or new to you. It is inherent in your nature. But it has been forgotten because people live in a false comfort with their ideas and assumptions and have lost much of their attentiveness to life. They live a predictable life that seems to be buffered against the tribulations of the world. And they go about their daily routines with little thought about where they are or what they are doing at any given moment. They are more concerned with their feelings and with their acquisitions than they are with what is going on around them in their environment. People are often shocked when things occur that affect or influence them, as if it were happening for the first time. They are shocked, wondering, “How did this happen? Where did this come from?” But in fact, it has been growing for some time. They missed the messages. They did not see the cues. They missed the early warning signs.</p>
<p>这种技能对你来说并不陌生或新奇。它是你与生俱来的自然。但它已经被遗忘，因为人们生活在虚假的舒适中，沉浸在他们的想法和假设中，对生命的关注度大大降低。他们过着一种可预测的生命，似乎可以免受世间苦难的侵扰。他们每天按部就班，很少考虑他们身在何处或在做什么。他们更关心他们的感受和他们的收获，而不是周围环境中发生的事情。当发生影响他们的事情时，人们常常会感到震惊，就好像它是第一次发生一样。他们很震惊，想知道“这是怎么发生的？这是从哪里来的？”但事实上，这种情绪已经酝酿了一段时间。他们错过了讯息。他们没有看到线索。他们错过了早期的预警信号。</p>
<p>Being still is being present with yourself and with whatever is going on in your environment. It is not about having happy or positive thoughts or fearful or negative thoughts. It is about looking, listening and feeling. This prepares you to know things. This sets the stage for insight. This is a fundamental skill, and it will be a part of your fundamental preparation in The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. It is not meant for you to be still all the time, for this is a world of activity and you must be active. But you can be still even while you are active. Being still does not mean that there is nothing happening. It simply means that you are being attentive. Being still does not mean that there is no action. It means that you are being observant of action.</p>
<p>保持静止就是与你自己同在，与周围发生的一切同在。它不是关于拥有快乐或积极的思想，也不是关于恐惧或消极的思想。它是关于观察、倾听和感受。这让你做好了知道事情的准备。这为洞察力奠定了基础。这是一项基本技能，它将成为你在大社区内识之路上基本准备的一部分。这并不意味着你要一直保持静止，因为这是一个活动的世界，你必须活跃起来。但即使在你活跃的时期，你也可以保持静止。保持静止并不意味着什么都没有发生。它只是意味着你在专注。保持静止并不意味着没有行动。它意味着你在观察行动。</p>
<p>At the outset you must face the reality that you have lost a great deal of your skill in this regard, and you will find that your beginning practice in stillness will be difficult because you are used to being dominated by your thoughts and by the thoughts of others. What you are doing here in your training is reclaiming a fundamental skill, an inherent ability. When your ancient ancestors lived, vulnerable, in the natural environment, they had to use this skill a great deal. They were in dynamic relationship with their environment, and they had to rely upon their senses and their insights to gauge where they were and what was going to happen next. They did not live such a predictable life as you may feel that you live today.</p>
<p>一开始，你必须面对现实，你已经失去了这方面的大量技能，你会发现，开始练习静止是困难的，因为你习惯于被你的思想和他人的思想所支配。你在这里的训练中所做的就是重新获得一项基本技能，一种与生俱来的能力。当你的古代祖先们生活在自然环境中时，他们脆弱不堪，他们不得不大量使用这种技能。他们与环境的关系是动态的，他们必须依靠他们的感官和洞察力来判断他们在哪里，以及接下来会发生什么。他们的生命并不像你今天所感觉到的那样可预测。</p>
<p>Yet when you consider your life today, you will see that you are undergoing unprecedented change, change to a degree and at an acceleration that your ancestors could not even comprehend. The adaptive requirements upon you today are even greater than upon your ancestors, for those forces that threatened their survival were known to them. But today the forces that threaten your survival are barely known to you. Beyond human violence and the destruction of your environment, the presence of the Greater Community forces in the world and their attempt to integrate with humanity to gain control over humanity represent a challenge your ancestors could not face. Yet where is your adaptive ability? Where is your perceptive ability?</p>
<p>然而当你思考你今天的生命时，你将会看到你正在经历前所未有的变化，变化的程度和速度是你的祖先甚至无法理解的。今天你对适应的要求甚至比你的祖先更高，因为他们知道那些威胁他们生存的力量。但今天威胁你们生存的势力你们几乎不知道。除了人类暴力和你们环境的破坏之外，大社区势力在世界上的存在以及他们试图与人类融合以获得对人类的控制，代表着你们祖先无法面对的挑战。然而你的适应能力在哪里？你的感知能力在哪里？</p>
<p>We have said that intelligence in the Greater Community is defined as the desire and the ability to adapt, to create and to function. Can you function if your environment changes? Can you experience change? Can you face change? Can you undergo change? Can you adapt to new situations? Or is your life frozen in a state of mental paralysis where everything has to be just so in order for you to feel any comfort or sense of self-reliance? Does everything have to be predictable and managed? Though there is a great attempt to produce these kinds of circumstances, life moves forward and the evolution of the world continues, unabated and unaffected by the beliefs and activities of humanity.</p>
<p>我们说过，大社区里的智能被定义为适应、创造和运作的渴望和能力。如果你的环境改变了，你还能运作吗？你能体验改变吗？你能面对改变吗？你能经受改变吗？你能适应新的情况吗？还是你的生命被冻结在一种心理麻痹的状态中，一切都必须如此，你才能感受到任何安慰或自力更生的感觉？一切都必须是可预测和可管理的吗？尽管人们在努力创造这类境况，但生命仍在前进，世界的进化仍在继续，不受人类信仰和活动的影响，丝毫没有减弱。</p>
<p>You are living in a dynamic world and in a dynamic universe. The world today is a different world than even your parents experienced, and it is changing quickly. It is changing so fast that people cannot even keep up with it. Being present in the world does not mean that you have to experience everything. What it means is being present to what is occurring that is important now, keeping your eyes and ears open, not fearfully but attentively. Like a person in a watchtower scanning the horizon, you look out onto life as it is, and you look out onto the horizon of your future, for what is coming is coming. Yes, the future can be changed. Yes, it can be altered. But that takes time, in most cases. What was created yesterday will arrive tomorrow. What is created today will arrive in the near future.</p>
<p>你生活在一个充满活力的世界和充满活力的宇宙中。当今的世界甚至与你的父母所经历的世界都不同，而且它正在迅速改变。它改变得如此之快，以至于人们甚至无法跟上。活在世上并不意味着你必须经历一切。它意味着活在当下正在发生的重要事情中，睁大眼睛，竖起耳朵，不是恐惧，而是专注。就像一个站在瞭望塔上扫视地平线的人，你看着生命本来的样子，看着未来的地平线，因为即将发生的事情即将到来。是的，未来是可以改变的。是的，它可以被改变。但在大多数情况下，这需要时间。昨天创造的事物明天就会到来。今天创造的事物将在不久的将来到来。</p>
<p>It is important to have this idea of a watchtower in your mind because this helps you to understand where you are, who you are with and what is happening in the mental environment that could be affecting you emotionally and mentally. Here you keep track of what is happening in the physical environment, for events do not just happen like that. Things build up and then things happen. The ones who are attentive will see the oncoming difficulty and will prepare accordingly, if they are wise. They will rarely be taken by surprise completely, though that is still possible. They will see what is coming, and they will feel it while others do not even have a clue.</p>
<p>在你的心灵中拥有这个瞭望塔的想法是很重要的，因为它帮助你理解你在哪里，你和谁在一起，以及心理环境中正在发生什么，这可能会在情感上和心理上影响你。在这里，你追踪物理环境中正在发生的事情，因为事件不会就这样发生。事情会积累起来，然后事情发生。那些留心的人将看到即将到来的困难，并相应地做好准备，如果他们是明智的的话。他们很少会完全措手不及，尽管这仍然是可能的。他们将看到即将发生的事情，他们将感受到它，而其他人甚至还不知道。</p>
<p>Consider the animals in the world, whose very existence depends on the ability to be observant and to be cautious. They do not take their existence for granted. They do not assume that they are protected and provided for. They are watchful. They are careful. They live vulnerable to life. Yet you have a greater capacity and a greater intelligence.</p>
<p>想想世界上的动物，它们的生存依赖于观察力和谨慎的能力。它们不会把自己的存在视为理所当然。它们不会认为自己受到保护和供养。它们警惕。它们小心翼翼。它们的生命脆弱不堪。然而，你们却拥有一种更大的能力和一种更大的智能。</p>
<p>You also have a greater mission in the world, a mission which will be revealed to you only if you develop your foundation for living and learning The Way of Knowledge. The requirements for you to become present in the world are very great. There is a great deal happening in the world that will affect everyone, and there is a great deal happening in your immediate environment which affects you. As your life and function in life become more well defined, you will need to give your attention to fewer things, but in a different and deeper way. Your greater work in the world is given to you once you have a foundation. Then you will need to be very attentive to things that are directly related to it. And you will need to be very attentive to the overall movement of the world, which can be deeply felt.</p>
<p>你在世界上也肩负着一个更伟大的使命，这个使命只有当你发展了生活在内识之路和学习内识之路的基础时才会向你揭示。你出现在世界上的要求非常高。世界上发生了许多事情，它们会影响每个人，你身边的环境也发生了许多事情，它们影响着你。随着你的生命以及在生命中的运作变得更加明确，你将需要关注更少的事情，但是以一种不同且更深层次的方式。一旦你有了基础，你在世界上更伟大的工作就被赋予了。那时你将需要非常关注与之直接相关的事物。你将需要非常关注世界的整体运动，这是可以深刻感受到的。</p>
<p>Here you must allow your questions to be unanswered, for people have become accustomed to relying on their understanding and their ideas and as a result have lost much of their adaptive abilities. For they feel safer with their old ideas than they do with new experiences. And they fall back on their old ideas when faced with new experiences because new experiences make them feel vulnerable and often challenge their position.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须允许你的问题得不到解答，因为人们已经习惯于依赖他们的理解和他们的想法，结果丧失了他们大部分的适应能力。因为他们觉得他们的旧想法比新体验更安全。而当面对新体验时，他们又会依赖他们的旧想法，因为新体验让他们感到脆弱，并经常挑战他们的立场。</p>
<p>Being present to the world means your attention is on what is happening right now. The personal mind is always recirculating old information and trying to organize new information according to the old information. So it speculates about the future without seeing the future. And it speculates about the past without knowing the past. For all it knows is its ideas about the future and the past, which may have nothing to do with the future and the past at all.</p>
<p>面对世界，意味着你的注意力集中在当下正在发生的事情上。个人的心灵总是在重复旧的信息，并试图根据旧的信息来组织新的信息。因此，它推测未来，却看不到未来。它推测过去，却不知道过去。因为它所知道的只是它对未来和过去的想法，而这些想法可能与未来和过去毫无关系。</p>
<p>In your mind, then, your ideas are mostly recollections or they are speculations about new things that are related to your recollections. When you are involved in this kind of thinking, you are not present. Anything can happen, and you will not see it coming. Here you miss the cues. Here you miss the signs. Here you do not hear the encouragement or the guidance of Knowledge. Here you do not see the evidence of your future poor decisions. Here you do not see the evidence of your past poor decisions. Here you do not see where you are or who you are with or what is happening. You are just going along, primarily concerned with what is happening in your mind and how well you are doing in your life.</p>
<p>因此，在你的心灵中，你的想法大多是回忆，或者它们是对与你的回忆相关的新事物的猜测。当你陷入这种思维时，你就不在场了。任何事情都可能发生，而你不会看到它的到来。在这里你错过了线索。在这里你错过了迹象。在这里你听不到内识的鼓励或指导。在这里你看不到你未来糟糕决定的证据。在这里你看不到你过去糟糕决定的证据。在这里你看不到你在哪里，你和谁在一起，或者发生了什么。你只是随波逐流，主要关心的是在你的心灵中正在发生的想法，以及你的生命过得如何。</p>
<p>The person who is learning to be present is able to be engaged in activities, to think about the future or recall the past and yet be able to come into the present at any moment because there is a part of their mind that is always watching. When something is happening or about to happen, they are called back to attention. “Come look! See over here! Come out of your reverie! Come out of your thinking! Come out of your contemplation and be right here right now because something is happening here.” This attentiveness is very complete. You are not looking and thinking all the time. You are just looking. You are looking to see. It is as if you were trying to pick out some distant object on the horizon and you were giving all of your mental attention to doing this. Your mind is not babbling on. You are looking intensely.</p>
<p>学会在场的人能够参与各种活动，思考未来或回忆过去，但又能够随时进入当下，因为他们的心灵中总有一部分时刻在关注着。当某事正在发生或即将发生时，他们会被唤回注意力。“过来看！看这里！从你的遐想中走出来！从你的思维中走出来！从你的沉思中走出来，在场，因为某事正在这里发生。”这种专注是非常完整的。你并不是一直在看和思考。你只是在看。你在寻找。它就像你试图在地平线上挑选出某个遥远的物体，你把所有的注意力都放在了这件事上。你心灵不是在喋喋不休。你正在全神贯注地看。</p>
<p>When the weather changes, the animals become quiet or seek shelter. Yet most people go about their business as if nothing were happening. And that is only the weather. The great changes that will affect humanity have to do with the growing global problems that will affect everyone’s ability to survive in the world. They also have to do with the presence of the Greater Community, which will affect your ability to determine your destiny as a race. These greater movements in life have direct bearing on your life today and on the future, but they are part of the bigger picture, and people are not keyed into the bigger picture. These greater movements are part of your overall life and may be missed if all of your attention is fixated on immediate things.</p>
<p>当天气改变时，动物们会变得安静或寻找庇护所。然而大多数人却像什么事都没发生一样继续做着他们的事。而那只是天气而已。影响人类的伟大变革与日益严重的全球问题有关，这些问题将影响每个人在世界上的生存能力。它们还与大社区的存在有关，这将影响你们作为一个种族决定天命的能力。生命中这些更伟大的运动与你们今天和未来的生命有直接关系，但它们是更大图景的一部分，而人们并没有融入到更大的图景中。这些更伟大的运动是你整体生命的一部分，如果你所有的注意力都集中在眼前的事情上，你可能会错过它们。</p>
<p>The man or woman of Knowledge is able to stop, look and listen. The man or woman of Knowledge is always listening when they are conversing with others, and they are always looking and listening when they are in new environments. They have learned to become sensitive when it is necessary and to withdraw their sensitivity when that is necessary because if you are too sensitive all the time, you will not be able to function in the abrasive interactions of the world.</p>
<p>拥有内识的男人或女人能够停下来，观察和倾听。拥有内识的男人或女人在与他人交谈时总是在倾听，当他们身处新环境时也总是在观察和倾听。他们学会了在必要的时候变得敏感，也学会了在必要的时候收回他们的敏感，因为如果你总是过于敏感，你将无法在这个世界激烈的互动中发挥作用。</p>
<p>How do you learn to become present? You learn by practicing and by training the mind. Your mind is not too old to be trained. It can be redirected and re-employed. No matter how old and useless its ideas might be in contrast to the demands of your present life, your mind can be redirected and re-employed to serve you and to serve others. In Steps to Knowledge, you practice learning to be still. You practice with stillness meditations. And you practice stopping upon the hour to check where you are and what is happening. People often misunderstand these practices, for they think that being still is asking for things because they are still thinking that life is a welfare process or that spirituality is a welfare system. So as soon as they are still, they want to get something. They want to have an insight, a reward, a beautiful experience, a great realization, and so they look for the prize. They are still because they are going to get a prize, or so they think. But in reality, when you practice stillness, just practice being still and observant.</p>
<p>你如何学会在场？你通过实践和训练心灵来学习。你的心灵不会因为太老而无法训练。它可以被重新引导和重新使用。无论它的想法与你现在生命的要求相比有多么陈旧和无用，你的心灵都可以被重新引导和重新使用，为你和他人服务。在内识进阶中，你练习学习静心。你练习静心冥想。你练习在整点时停下来检查你在哪里以及发生了什么。人们常常误解这些练习，因为他们认为静心就是在要求事物，因为他们仍然认为生命是一种福利的过程，或者精神性是一个福利系统。所以一旦他们静心，他们就想得到一些东西。他们想要有洞察力、奖励、美好的体验、伟大的领悟，所以他们寻找奖品。他们之所以静心，是因为他们会得到奖品，或者他们是这么认为的。但在现实中，当你练习静止时，只是练习静心和观察。</p>
<p>Stillness is not the only practice in The Way of Knowledge, but it is an important one because it enables you to be effective in life. It enables you to become aware of what is affecting you and how you are affecting others. It enables you to be very present, which minimizes the risk of injury and maximizes your ability to affect situations in which you are engaged. For isn’t it clear that when your whole mind is present to something, it has much greater power and effectiveness? And when you are really paying attention to something, isn’t it easier to recognize when problems arise and to catch them before they cause damage? In driving your automobile, one moment of inattentiveness and you hit someone. You never saw them. One moment of not paying attention and something catastrophic can happen. You have seen this. You have felt this. This has been part of your experience. When you have initiated relationships in the past, were you really paying attention to the other person or were you caught up in your desire, fantasy and excitement so much that you could not see the reality?</p>
<p>静止并非内识之路中唯一的修行，但它却非常重要，因为它能让你有效地生活。它能让你意识到什么在影响你，以及你是如何影响他人的。它能让你非常专注，从而将受伤的风险降到最低，并最大限度地提高你影响所处情境的能力。因为，当你全神贯注于某件事时，它的力量和效率会大得多，这难道不明显吗？当你真正关注某件事时，不是更容易识别问题何时出现并在造成损害之前解决它们吗？开车时，一不留神就会撞到别人。你从未看到他们。一不留心就会发生灾难性的事情。你见过这种事。你感受过这种事。这是你经历的一部分。在过去，当你开始一段关系时，你真的在​​关注对方吗？还是你太沉迷于你的欲望、幻想和兴奋而看不到现实？</p>
<p>People often say after many years in a failed relationship, “Well, I saw all these tendencies at the outset. I could see these problems.” But could they really see them? Could they really respond? If you are attentive to people, they will tell you a great deal about themselves. And if you do not condemn them, you will be able to learn from them and appreciate their situation in life. This is all a result of being present.</p>
<p>人们在经历了失败的恋情多年后，常常会说：“好吧，我一开始就看到了所有这些倾向。我可以看到这些问题。”但他们真的能看到吗？他们真的能做出回应吗？如果你用心倾听他人，他们会告诉你许多关于他们自己的事情。如果你不谴责他们，你就能从他们身上学到东西，欣赏他们的生命状况。这一切都是一种在场的结果。</p>
<p>Now let us talk about love. For many people, when they think of spirituality, they associate it with love, and they think that love is a behavior. In other words, when you are loving, you are kind and you are sweet and you are gentle and you are pleasant and you are calm and you are reassuring. These kinds of images and these kinds of behavior are associated with love very exclusively. But what is love really? Is love only being pleasant, sweet and kind? Love expresses itself in other ways as well. When love denies you something you want but which is not good for you, you experience it as a great disappointment. You are angry and frustrated, but love is at work here. When you realize that you have made a poor decision about something and you feel terrible about it, love is at work here. And when you feel an impending problem which threatens someone you love, and you are deeply disturbed and called into action, love is at work here. Therefore, do not associate love with behavior, or you will lose sight of the real presence and the real activity of love.</p>
<p>现在让我们来谈谈爱。很多人一想到精神性，就会把它与爱联系在一起，认为爱是一种行为。换句话说，当你充满爱时，你是善良的、甜蜜的、温柔的、愉快的、平静的、令人安心的。这些形象和行为都与爱联系在一起。但爱到底是什么？爱只是愉快、甜蜜和善良吗？爱也以其他方式表达它自己。当爱拒绝你想要但对你不利的东西时，你会感到非常失望。你很生气，很沮丧，但爱就在这里起作用。当你意识到自己对某件事做出了错误的决定，并为此感到很糟糕时，爱在这里起作用。当你感觉到一个即将来临的问题威胁到你所爱的人，你深感不安并被要求采取行动时，爱在这里起作用。因此，不要把爱和行为联系在一起，否则你会忽视爱的真正存在和真正的活动。</p>
<p>To experience love is to experience being present with someone, being with them, without judging them, without trying to fit them into your life, without trying to see what advantages you can gain from being with them, without trying to use them for any purpose or methods that you might have, without condemning them for failing your expectations or standards. Love is being present. It is giving yourself and being present. Does everything have to be sweet and happy and pleasant? No. In most cases, things are not. Do you have to have wonderful and quiescent feelings? No. In fact, you may feel very concerned and disturbed. When you realize how much you have betrayed your Knowledge for personal convenience or advantage, you will feel angry. Be present to this. In order to keep you from making grave mistakes over and over, you must taste the disappointment and the result of these errors and feel them deeply. You are loving yourself when you do that. You are not beating yourself up. You are saying, “I am really going to feel what this feels like because I never want to make this mistake again! Life is giving me the response to error. I want to know what this response is so that it can protect me in the future.” Here you are being loving. Here love is not associated with pleasantries.</p>
<p>体验爱就是体验与某人同在，与他们在一起，不评判他们，不试图将他们融入你的生命，不试图看看与他们在一起能给你带来什么好处，不试图利用他们达到你可能拥有的任何目的或方法，不谴责他们辜负你的期望或标准。爱就是在场。它是给予你自己，在存在中在场。一切都必须甜蜜、幸福和愉快吗？不。在大多数情况下，事情并非如此。你必须有美妙而宁静的感觉吗？不。事实上，你可能会感到非常担心和不安。当你意识到你为了个人的方便或利益而背叛了你的内识时，你会感到愤怒。面对这一点。为了防止你一再犯下严重的错误，你必须品尝这些错误的失望和后果，并深刻感受它们。当你这样做时，你是在爱你自己。你不是在责备你自己。你在说，“我真的会感受到这种感觉，因为我再也不想犯这个错误了！”生命给了我应对错误的答案。我想知道这种反应是什么，以便将来能保护我。”你在这里表现出爱意。在这里，爱与客套无关。</p>
<p>Love can be very powerful. Love can be very confronting. Love can be very challenging. Love can be very dynamic. Love can also be very peaceful. Love can be very kind and reassuring. All of these things happen with love, and all of these activities can happen without love. People can be kind without love. People can be reassuring without love. People can say sweet and wonderful things without love. People can claim to be very spiritually endowed without love.</p>
<p>爱可以非常强大。爱可以非常对抗。爱可以非常具有挑战性。爱可以非常动态。爱也可以非常平和。爱可以非常仁慈和令人安心。所有这些事情都是在爱中发生的，所有这些活动都可以在没有爱的情况下发生。人们可以没有爱而仁慈。人们可以没有爱而令人安心。人们可以没有爱而说出甜蜜而美妙的话。人们可以声称自己拥有很高的精神天赋，但却没有爱。</p>
<p>The Creator is present to you. That is love. You become present to the Creator. That is love. Love starts with being present. When you are at the bedside of a dying person, and it does not matter what you say, and reassuring words are not appropriate and you do not have to be happy because it is not a happy situation necessarily, what is the real response? Be present. Be there.</p>
<p>造物主就在你身边。这就是爱。你成为造物主的一份子。这就是爱。爱始于在场。当你站在一个垂死的人的床边，无论你说什么都无济于事，安慰的话也不合适，你也不必高兴，因为这不一定是一个快乐的情形，真正的回应是什么？在场。在那里。</p>
<p>Now, if your life is all about getting happiness, as if you were acquiring tokens from life or trying to gain some kind of emotional wealth where you could be happy all day long and nothing was in your environment which could possibly disturb you, then you could never be present because when you are being present, you are facing life as it is and not as you want it to be. You are meeting life where life is real, whether it fits your ideas or not. Your ideas do not matter except insofar as they can prevent you from being present.</p>
<p>现在，如果你的生命就是为了获得幸福，就好像你从生命中获取象征物或试图获得某种情感财富，这样你就可以整天开心，而你周围的一切都不会打扰你，那么你就永远无法在场，因为当你活在当下时，你面对的是生命的本来面目，而不是你想要的生命。你是在真实的生命中与生命相遇，不管它是否符合你的想法。你的想法并不重要，除非它们会阻止你活在当下。</p>
<p>In Steps to Knowledge you learn to be present because you have to learn to be present to Knowledge within yourself and to Knowledge within others. You have to learn to become present to error within yourself and error within others. You have to learn to become present to the greater movements and forces of the world and to your response to them. You have to be present to know who to be with and how to be with them. You have to be present to arrest the old patterns of thinking and behavior which make the mind work in an automatic and unintelligent way. You have to be present to be able to adapt and to learn. Without this ability to be present, you will not be able to undertake the other aspects of the preparation.</p>
<p>在内识进阶中，你学会在场，因为你必须学会​​在场你自己内在的内识和他人内在的内识。你必须学会​​在场你自己内在的错误和他人内在的错误。你必须学会​​在场世界的更伟大运动和力量以及你对它们的回应。你必须在场才能知道与谁在一起以及如何与他们在一起。你必须在场才能阻止旧的思维和行为模式，这些模式让心灵以一种自动的、非智能的方式运作。你必须在场才能适应和学习。没有这种在场的能力，你将无法开展准备的其他方面。</p>
<p>You have to be present to build your foundation for Knowledge. Each of the Four Pillars of life require your present engagement. They do not just happen. They do not build themselves. You have to play your part, and you have to see what you are doing because there are important lessons to learn in all of the Four Pillars of life. This is where you gain your Wisdom, for you were not born with Wisdom. You were born with Knowledge. You must gain the Wisdom by being here. Wisdom is about how to be here. Until you become wise enough, you cannot become an agent of Knowledge. Knowledge will not emerge until you are ready to be its representative. Only Knowledge knows when you are ready. You will not know. You will think you know. You may even declare that you are ready. You may feel you are ready because you want to be ready, but only Knowledge knows if you are ready. And if you are attentive, you will begin to see what Knowledge knows. Look back on your life and recall the times that you really thought that you were ready for something and you tried to do it on your own and take control of the situation only to find out that you did not have the understanding, the resources or the capacity to deal with what being ready really involved.</p>
<p>你必须亲临现场，为内识打下基础。生命的四大支柱都需要你亲临现场。它们不会凭空而来。它们不会自行构建。你必须扮演好你的角色，你必须看清你在做什么，因为在生命的四大支柱中都有重要的教训需要学习。这就是你获得智慧的地方，因为你并非生来就有智慧。你生来就有内识。你必须亲临现场，才能获得智慧。智慧是关于如何亲临现场。除非你变得足够明智，否则你无法成为内识的代理人。除非你准备好成为它的代表，否则内识不会出现。只有内识知道你何时准备好了。你不会知道。你会认为你知道。你甚至可能宣称你准备好了。你可能觉得你准备好了，因为你想准备好，但只有内识知道你是否准备好了。如果你留心观察，你就会开始看到内识知道什么。回顾你的生命，回想一下那些你真的认为你自身已经为某事做好了准备，并试图自己做这件事，掌控局面，却发现你不具备理解力、资源或能力来处理做好准备真正涉及的内容。</p>
<p>For example, people think that they are ready for marriage and union with another, and they cannot wait. So, they go out and establish marriage after marriage after marriage. It is only later, if they develop, that they can look back and say, “Well, that was premature. I really wasn’t ready for it.” Knowledge knows when you are ready, and if you are attentive, you will begin to see what Knowledge knows.</p>
<p>例如，人们认为他们已经准备好与他人结婚和结合，他们等不及了。所以，他们出去建立一桩又一桩的婚姻。只有当婚姻发展到一定阶段时，他们才会回头说：“嗯，那时还为时过早。我真的还没准备好。”内识知道你何时准备好了，如果你留心观察，你就会开始看到内识所知道的。</p>
<p>This requires a lot of patience because you are not trying to make anything happen when you are being present. You are simply observing. You are observing to see and to feel how things are. Watch the deer in the field. It will feed and then look up and make sure that everything is okay. Then it will go back to its activity. You can learn a great deal from the animals. They are more attentive than you are. They do not have the capacity to understand to the extent that you do, but they are far more attentive. In this, they have been more successful. There are those in the Greater Community who are more powerful than you, just like you are more powerful than the deer in the field. They can outsmart you, but only if you are not looking. They can affect your mind, but they cannot control it if you are with Knowledge, for Knowledge is the only part of your mind that cannot be controlled or manipulated. It is the only part of you that is really free.</p>
<p>这需要很大的耐心，因为当你在场时，你并没有试图让任何事情发生。你只是在观察。你观察是为了看到和感受到事情是怎样的。观察田野里的鹿。它会进食，然后抬头，确保一切都好。然后它会回到它的活动。你可以从动物身上学到很多东西。它们比你更专注。它们没有你这样的理解能力，但它们远比你专注。在这方面，它们更成功。大社区里有些种族比你们更强大，就像你比田野里的鹿更强大一样。他们可以智胜你，但前提是你不去观察。他们可以影响你的心灵，但如果你拥有内识，他们就无法控制内识，因为内识是你心灵中唯一无法控制或操纵的部分。它是你唯一真正自由的部分。</p>
<p>Yet the freedom of Knowledge is not the kind of freedom that people usually associate with the word freedom. Knowledge cannot go off and do any old thing any time, for it is here on a mission. It is free to do its mission, and that is its freedom. You are not yet free to do your mission, so you are not yet free because this is the real meaning of freedom. Otherwise, freedom is simply the right to be chaotic and destructive. People think of freedom as a state where there are no inhibitions and no restraints. You can do whatever you want whenever you want. Is that freedom? What does that produce? What does that yield for the person? People espouse and advocate freedom to try to help others to become free of their restraints. This is good, but it is only half the picture. The other half of the picture is what you are being freed to do.</p>
<p>然而，内识的自由并非人们通常与自由一词联系在一起的那种自由。内识不能随时离开去做任何旧事，因为它在这里肩负使命。它可以自由地完成它的使命，这就是它的自由。你还不能自由地完成你的使命，所以你还不是自由的，因为这是自由的真正含义。否则，自由就只是混乱和破坏的权利。人们认为自由是一种没有抑制和限制的状态。你可以随时随地做任何你想做的事。这是自由吗？这会产生什么？这会给人带来什么？人们拥护和提倡自由，试图帮助他人摆脱束缚。这很好，但这只是一半。另一半是你被释放去做什么。</p>
<p>Freedom must be good for something, for within itself it has no meaning. And yet freedom is cherished as this very right to be chaotic. So the emphasis is on having no restraints, on becoming unaccountable to anyone or anything to as great an extent as the person can achieve. But is this freedom? What is this freedom for? People say, “Well, it’s freedom to be happy and to do what you want.” But people do what they want, and they are not happy. And people say, “Well, that is a psychological problem.”</p>
<p>自由必须有其益处，因为自由本身毫无意义。然而，自由却被看作是混乱的权利。因此，自由的重点在于不受约束，在个人能力所能达到的范围内对任何人或任何事物不负责任。但这是自由吗？这种自由是为了什么？人们说：“嗯，快乐和做自己想做的事就是自由。”但人们做他们想做的事，却并不快乐。人们会说：“好吧，这是一个心理问题。”</p>
<p>The only real freedom in life is the freedom to find your purpose and to fulfill it. All other freedom is the freedom to be reckless, and this will lead to catastrophe and disappointment. The advancing students of Knowledge recognize this, and they realize how much it has taken for them to gain the freedom that they have, the freedom to be able to find and to follow Knowledge. They have severed their other allegiances which took the place of Knowledge—their allegiances to their beliefs and their allegiances to those people in their life who were authorities for them before. They have given their greatest allegiance to Knowledge, and they have given their greatest allegiance to those relationships which represent Knowledge. For Knowledge does not ask you to cut all of your allegiances to other people but to learn to establish them meaningfully. Knowledge seeks to join you with others in a meaningful way. It is not a substitute for relationships. You cannot abandon people and go chasing after Knowledge because Knowledge seeks to bring you to people.</p>
<p>生命中唯一真正的自由是找到并实现你的目的的自由。所有其他自由都是鲁莽的自由，这将导致灾难和失望。内识的进步学生认识到了这一点，他们意识到他们付出了多少努力才获得了他们所拥有的自由，能够找到并遵循内识的自由。他们已经切断了取代内识的其他忠诚——他们对信仰的忠诚，以及对那些曾经是他们生命中的权威的忠诚。他们已经对内识表现出了最大的忠诚，他们已经对那些代表内识的关系表现出了最大的忠诚。因为内识并不要求你切断对其他人的所有忠诚，而是要求你学会有意义地建立它们。内识寻求以一种有意义的方式将你与他人联系起来。它不是关系的替代品。你不能抛弃他人而去追逐内识，因为内识寻求将你带到他人身边。</p>
<p>People are afraid of Knowledge because they think it will infringe upon their freedom. As much as they want the dispensations of the Creator, they do not want any requirements either. They are protecting their right to be reckless, and yet they are protecting the very thing that is harming them and infringing upon them. There is no real freedom in the Universe because you cannot be separate from everything else. You have to be accountable to life because you are part of life. You do not function independently from life. You are not truly independent. Independence is a relative thing, and its value is only based on what it can lead you to do and to be.</p>
<p>人们害怕内识，因为他们认为内识会侵犯他们的自由。他们想要造物主的恩赐，但他们也不想要任何要求。他们在保护自己肆意妄为的权利，但他们却在保护伤害他们、侵犯他们的事情。宇宙中没有真正的自由，因为你无法与其他一切分离。你必须对生命负责，因为你是生命的一部分。你无法独立于生命而运作。你并不是真正独立的。独立是一种相对的事情，它的价值仅仅基于它能引导你做什么、成为什么。</p>
<p>Freedom is real if it leads to Knowledge. If freedom denies Knowledge, then it is not freedom. The right to be reckless, not to be accountable to anything or to anyone is simply a means of protecting your separation. And when the ladder is put down into the hole to help you out, you will not climb it because you will not want to commit yourself. You will think, “Well, I want to keep my options open.” What options are there? People think there are endless options and opportunities. There are not. They do not respect the reality of life. They do not see their limitations. And they do not see how rare and precious real opportunity is. Because they are thinking like a person on welfare, they think, “It will come. It doesn’t matter. There will be more opportunities. There are always opportunities.” This is welfare mentality.</p>
<p>如果自由通向内识，那么它就是真实的。如果自由否定内识，那么它就不是自由。不计后果、不对任何事或任何人负责的权利，只是保护你与外界分离的一种手段。当有人把梯子放到洞里帮你解脱时，你不会爬上去，因为你不想承诺你自己。你会想，“好吧，我想保留我的选择。”有什么选择呢？人们认为有无穷无尽的选择和机会。其实没有。他们不尊重生命的现实。他们看不到他们的局限性。他们看不到真正的机会是多么的稀有和珍贵。因为他们的思维方式就像一个领取救济金的人，他们认为，“它会来的。没关系。还会有更多的机会。总是有机会的。”这是一种福利的心理。</p>
<p>To be in life is not to be on welfare. To be in life is to be productive and responsible. Though certain people have become financially dependent, they can find a way out of this. We are talking about a psychological sense of welfare, a mental state, an attitude, a set of assumptions. People approach spirituality often because they are looking for a greater welfare system to protect them, to provide for them, to bless them and to give them miracles. Yet blessings and miracles exist for those who can give themselves to the world and who can bring Knowledge into the world. Miracles and blessings are evident and present for those who can build a foundation for Knowledge so that Knowledge can rest upon their shoulders, so that they can bear the burden and the grace of Knowledge.</p>
<p>生命的意义不在于依赖福利。生命的意义在于富有生产力并承担责任。尽管某些人在经济上变得依赖他人，但他们可以找到摆脱这种状态的方法。我们谈论的是一种心理上的福利感，心理状态，一种态度，一套假设。人们接近精神性，往往是因为他们在寻找一个更大的福利系统来保护他们、供养他们、祝福他们并给他们带来奇迹。然而，祝福和奇迹是为那些能够把自己奉献给世界并能够把内识带入世界的人而存在的。奇迹和祝福对于那些能够为内识建立基础的人来说是显而易见的，他们能够让内识依托在他们的肩膀上，承担内识的负担与恩典。</p>
<p>We have said that developing in The Way of Knowledge reverses the order of authority within you. In the beginning of your preparation, the mind seems to serve the body, and the Spirit is there to serve the mind. But this is the reverse of the real order, and so there must be a great process of relearning here. Have this understanding because everything in life serves life. The body serves. The mind serves. And the Spirit serves. Everything serves. But to reverse the order of authority requires that one rethink and re-evaluate the basic assumptions about life, about God, about spirituality, about freedom, about personal rights, about communication—about everything! For everything must be reinterpreted and understood in a real context. If the context is not real, the results of evaluation will be flawed.</p>
<p>我们说过，在内识之路上发展会颠覆你内在的权威秩序。在你准备的开始阶段，心灵似乎服务于身体，而精神则服务于心灵。但这是真实秩序的逆转，因此这里必须有一个伟大的重新学习过程。要有这种理解，因为生命中的一切都服务于生命。身体服务。心灵服务。精神服务。一切都在服务。但要颠覆权威秩序，就需要一个人重新思考和重新评估关于生命、关于上帝、关于精神性、关于自由、关于个人权利、关于交流——关于一切的基本假设！因为一切都必须在真实的​​背景下重新诠释和理解。如果背景不真实，评估的结果就会有缺陷。</p>
<p>That is why in The Way of Knowledge your ideas are not attacked even if they are incorrect. The focus is on changing the context so that you can see clearly and have full access to all of your mental and physical abilities. It is to rejoin you as one person with one purpose and one focus that creates harmony and unity within yourself so that you can demonstrate harmony and unity to others. You must be present to yourself and to others to enable this to happen. And the more you gain strength in having this presence of mind, the deeper will be your insights and the greater will be your vision and comprehension. As long as you are in the world, you will never see as much as The Unseen Ones, but you can see what you need to see in order to carry out your mission and purpose.</p>
<p>正因为如此，在内识之路上，你的想法即使不正确也不会受到攻击。重点在于改变背景，这样你就能看得清，并充分发挥你所有的心理和生理能力。重点在于让你重新结合为一个拥有一个目的和一个焦点的人，从而在你内心创造和谐与统一，这样你就能向他人展示和谐与统一。你必须对你自己和他人保持在场，才能让这一切发生。你越是获得在心灵中的在场力量，你的洞察力就会越深刻，你的视野和理解力就会越强大。只要你身处这个世界，你就永远不会像不可见者那样看到那么多，但你可以看到你需要看到的内识，以便实现你的使命和目的。</p>
<p>When you are observant, you are respectful of the world and the environment. You do not take things for granted. You recognize that the world is powerful, and persuasions in the world are powerful. You respect them, even if they do not have a divine source. Instead of living on assumptions, you become grounded in experience. And Knowledge keeps your mind fresh and renewed because it is always challenging and broadening your understanding and perspective. Here your philosophy and your theology about life are flexible and adaptable. They are not fixed and rigid. They adapt themselves to the reality of life rather than trying to conform the reality of life to their precepts. An observant mind has this greater capacity. A still mind is a mind that can know. A still mind is a mind that can see. A still mind is a mind that can hear. A still mind is a mind that can feel. A still mind is a mind that can tolerate emptiness. A still mind is a mind that can face success or failure. A still mind is a mind that accepts the reality of things without condoning them.</p>
<p>当你善于观察时，你会尊重世界和环境。你不会将一切视为理所当然。你认识到世界是强大的，世界上的说服力也是强大的。你尊重它们，即使它们没有神圣的来源。你不再生活在假设中，而是扎根于经验。内识让你的心灵保持新鲜和更新，因为它总是在挑战你，拓宽你的理解和视野。在这里，你的生命哲学和神学是灵活和适应性强的。它们不是固定的和僵化的。它们适应生命的现实，而不是试图让生命的现实符合它们的戒律。善于观察的心灵拥有这种更大的能力。平静的心灵是能够知道的心灵。平静的心灵是能看见的心灵。平静的心灵是能够听见的心灵。平静的心灵是能够感受的心灵。平静的心灵是能够容忍空虚的心灵。平静的心灵是能够面对成功或失败的心灵。平静的心灵是接受事物现实而不纵容它们的心灵。</p>
<p>If you develop in The Way of Knowledge, eventually you will begin to feel the presence of your Spiritual Family with you. Though they seem far away in a whole other dimension of life, in reality they are close at hand. As your mind becomes still, it becomes more like a window than a wall. It becomes more of a membrane between your spiritual reality and your physical reality. Instead of becoming a barrier to the Divine, it becomes a medium for the Divine. A still mind is a mind that develops capacity for experience, for it is not filled with its own ideas and assumptions. A still mind is a mind that is fluid. It is not fixed in a past understanding. It is able to learn and to adapt its learning. A still mind recognizes that the world you see is not the ultimate reality but only a temporary one. Yet it is a reality that commands your attention and your respect nonetheless. A still mind can feel and see the reality of another and can know the pain and the promise in another’s life. A still mind can know who to be with and who to give yourself to. It sees and knows these things because these things are evident to those who can see and know. A still mind can allow life to be mysterious and unpredictable, for anything can happen. A still mind watches the environment because it wants to know what predominant influences exist there. A still mind is present to life and does not rest upon its assumptions. It can encompass new realities and new experiences. It can bridge the gap between the human mind and a mind from the Greater Community. It can discern the motives of those from the Greater Community, motives that escape the awareness of everyone else.</p>
<p>如果你在内识之路上发展，最终你会开始感受到精神家庭与你同在。尽管他们似乎远在生命的另一个维度，但实际上他们就在你身边。当你的心灵变得平静时，它变得更像一扇窗户而不是一堵墙。它更像是你精神现实和物质现实之间的一层薄膜。它不是成为神圣的障碍，而是成为神圣的媒介。平静的心灵是一种发展体验能力的心灵，因为心灵没有充满它自身的想法和假设。平静的心灵是一种流动的心灵。它不固守过去的理解。它能够学习并适应学习。平静的心灵认识到你看到的世界不是最终的现实，而只是暂时的现实。然而，这是一个需要你关注和尊重的现实。平静的心灵可以感受到和看到另一个人的现实，可以知道另一个人生命中的痛苦和希望。平静的心灵知道该和谁在一起，该把你自己交给谁。它看到并知道这些事情，因为这些事情对那些能够看到和知道的人来说是显而易见的。一个平静的心灵可以让生命变得神秘而不可预测，因为任何事情都可能发生。一个平静的心灵观察环境，因为它想知道那里存在着什么主要影响。一个平静的心灵在场于生命，并不停留在生命的假设上。它能够包容新的现实和新的体验。它能够弥合人类心灵和大社区心灵之间的鸿沟。它能够辨别那些来自大社区心灵的动机，而这些动机却不为其他人所知。</p>
<p>A still mind knows its limits, however, and does not assume that it has infinite powers. A still mind realizes that it is not the Creator but serves the Creator. A still mind realizes how little it knows and how much it must learn and is humble in its approach. A still mind is a mind that is aware of the cause of suffering and is available to learn how suffering can be relieved. A still mind can witness life but not from a safe distance. A still mind can see life as it is now and can feel the impact of life while retaining its greater connection to Knowledge.</p>
<p>然而，平静的心灵知道它的极限，并不认为它拥有无限的力量。平静的心灵认识到它不是造物主，而是服务于造物主。平静的心灵认识到它知道的是多么少，它必须学习的是多么多，并且以谦逊的态度对待。平静的心灵是察觉到痛苦的原因并愿意学习如何减轻痛苦的心灵。平静的心灵可以见证生命，但不是在安全的距离之外。平静的心灵可以看到现在的生命，可以感受到生命的影响，同时保持它与内识的更伟大联接。</p>
<p>Be present and you will have a new experience of love. Be present and you will have a new experience of yourself. Be present and you will be able to have a future, for your past will no longer dominate you as you gain this great skill and capacity. Be present to what is happening now. Be present to who is in your life. Be present to how you deeply feel about things. Be present to your deeper inclinations. Be present to your confusion and uncertainty.</p>
<p>在场，你就会拥有新的爱的体验。在场，你就会拥有新的自我体验。在场，你就能拥有未来，因为当你获得这种伟大的技能和能力时，你的过去将不再主宰你。在场，关注现在正在发生的事情。在场，关注你生命中的人。在场，关注你对事物的深刻感受。在场，关注你更深层次的倾向。在场，关注你的困惑和不确定性。</p>
<p>At times, look out on the horizon and see if anything is coming your way. You will gain this skill as a student of Knowledge. Yet whenever you assume that you have reached your final destination as a student, when you feel that you have learned the greatest lesson, when you believe that you have acquired the real understanding of life, when you are certain about the future, and when you have assigned or realized what you think is your real role, then you will no longer be present. Your learning will stop, and you will begin to lose ground.</p>
<p>有时，你要眺望地平线，看看是否有巨浪正向你袭来。作为一名内识的学生，你将获得这种技能。然而，每当你认为你已经到达了作为一名学生的最终目的地，当你觉得你已经学到了最伟大的一课，当你相信你已经获得了对生命的真正理解，当你对未来充满信心，当你分配或意识到你认为的你的真正角色时，那时你将不再在场。你的学习将停止，你将开始失去立足之地。</p>
<p>The little mouse, the little rabbit, the bird in the tree, the deer in the field, the fish in the stream are all observant. They need to be observant to maintain their right to live in the world. Within your realm, you need to be observant, not only to maintain your right to be in the world, which is a privilege, but to learn about your greater life here—how to build a foundation for that life, what that life means and how it can be revealed to you and to others.</p>
<p>小老鼠、小兔子、树上的鸟、田野里的鹿、溪流里的鱼都是善于观察的。它们需要善于观察，以维护它们在世界上生存的权利。在你的领域里，你需要善于观察，不仅是为了维护你在这个世界上生存的权利，这是一种特权，也是为了学习你在此的更伟大生命——如何为这种生命构建一个基础，这种生命意味着什么，以及如何将它揭示给你和他人。</p>
<p>Accept, then, the preparation to gain this greater skill—a skill which is inherent to your nature and fundamental to your well-being in the world. Accept that this preparation is long because it is a great training. You do not reverse decades of education in the world in a day, a week, a month or a year. Be a beginning student and you will be present because you will not be resting on your assumptions. Receive the training that is meant for you and do not try to construct a training for yourself, for you cannot take yourself where you have never gone, you cannot introduce yourself to new territory, and you cannot guide yourself in the wilderness because you do not know where you are going.</p>
<p>那么，接受获得这个更伟大技能的准备吧——这个技能是你自然所固有的，也是你在世间福祉的基础。接受这个准备是漫长的，因为它是一项伟大的训练。你不可能在一天、一周、一个月或一年内逆转世间数十年的教育。做一名初学者，你就会活在当下，因为你不会停留在你的假设上。接受为你准备的训练，不要试图为你自己构建训练，因为你无法带你自己去你从未去过的地方，你无法让你自己进入新的领域，你无法在荒野中引导你自己，因为你不知道你要去哪里。</p>
<p>Be simple but strong. Be direct and effective. Be observant and ready for action and yet willing to have no action. See the signs and the clues, and your decisions will reflect this greater ability. Be present to the world because the world needs your understanding. And the world needs the great strength you have brought with you from your Ancient Home.</p>
<p>简单但坚强。直接而有效。善于观察并准备好行动，但又愿意不采取行动。看到迹象和线索，你的决定将反映出这种更伟大的能力。面对世界，因为世界需要你的理解。世界需要你从古老家园带来的伟大力量。</p>
