<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 14, 1994 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1994 年 10 月 14 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you begin to realize the importance of this Teaching and its great message for humanity for this time and for the future, you will want to share certain ideas with people. Perhaps you will try to share the whole Teaching as far as you can understand it. It is natural to want to extend wondrous things once you discover them for yourself. Yet there are important things to remember when you are presenting The Way of Knowledge to others.</p>
<p>当你开始意识到这个教导的重要性，以及它对人类在当今和未来所传递的伟大讯息时，你会想要与人们分享某些想法。也许你会尝试在你能理解的范围内分享整个教导。一旦你自己发现了奇妙的内识，想要将其传播出去是很自然的。然而，当你向他人介绍内识之路时，有一些重要的事情需要记住。</p>
<p>One thing to remember is that people are living without Knowledge now, and though Knowledge is the most natural thing in the world to each person, it seems strange at first. It seems foreign to their experience and to their ideas, and it may indeed seem foreign to their education. You are presenting something powerful and mysterious. If it were merely powerful, people would seize upon it and try to use it for themselves as much as possible. If it were only mysterious, people would not feel drawn to it. But because The Way of Knowledge is both powerful and mysterious, it serves as a great challenge in learning.</p>
<p>要记住的一件事是，现在人们生活在没有内识的情况下，尽管内识对每个人来说都是世界上最自然的事情，但它一开始看起来很奇怪。它似乎与他们的经历和想法格格不入，而且它实际上可能与他们所受的教育格格不入。你呈现的是一种强大而神秘的内识。如果它只是强大，人们就会抓住它，并尽可能地为他们自己使用它。如果它只是神秘，人们就不会被它吸引。但因为内识之路既强大又神秘，所以它在学习中是一种伟大的挑战。</p>
<p>As a beginning student of Knowledge, you realize that your existing ideas and beliefs are not going to prepare you for the second great stage of your life. Yes, certain things will be carried forward, but for the most part you will have to begin all over again. So when you present this Teaching to another, you are really inviting them to begin all over again. However, people do not understand this. They simply want to use The Way of Knowledge as if it were a tool or a resource for them to carry on with what they have always done. Or perhaps they will be drawn to The Way of Knowledge because it will seem to give them greater promise. They may think, “Well, maybe I can use this to get a relationship,” or “Maybe I can use this to win money,” or “Maybe I can use this to become more powerful,” or “Maybe I can use this so I do not have to work so hard in the world.”</p>
<p>作为内识的初学者，你意识到你现有的想法和信念不会为你生命的第二个伟大阶段做好准备。是的，某些事情会继续下去，但大多数情况下，你必须从头开始。因此，当你向他人介绍这个教导时，你实际上是在邀请他们从头开始。然而，人们并不理解这一点。他们只是想把内识之路当作一种工具或资源，让他们继续做他们一直在做的事情。或者，也许他们会被内识之路吸引，因为它似乎会给他们更伟大的承诺。他们可能会想，“好吧，也许我可以用它获得一段关系”，或者“也许我可以用它赢得金钱”，或者“也许我可以用它变得更强大”，或者“也许我可以用它，这样我就不必在世界上那么努力地工作了。”</p>
<p>The Unseen Ones understand that what they are offering and what people want are not the same. It is when you can look beyond the wants and the insecurities of your mind and feel a deeper need and yearning that you will understand what the Unseen Ones are offering to you. Then you will understand what God is working on in the world, for the Creator is not here to give people what they want, but to give people what they have come to give, which is what they really want. Yet how can you tell someone that what they want is not what they really want unless they themselves have experienced this sufficiently to be able to make this distinction within themselves?</p>
<p>不可见者理解他们所提供的和人们想要的并不相同。只有当你能够超越你心灵的欲望和不安全感，并感受到一种更深层次的需求和渴望时，你才能理解不可见者在为你提供的内识。然后，你将理解上帝在世界上所做的工作，因为造物主来此不是为了给予人们他们想要的东西，而是为了给予人们他们来此给予的内识，也就是他们真正想要的内识。然而，除非他们自己充分体验了这一点，能够在他们内心做出这种区分，否则你怎么能告诉某人他们自己想要的不是他们自己真正想要的呢？</p>
<p>Therefore, when you present The Greater Community Way of Knowledge or the ideas in this book to others, give them time to come to terms with what is being offered here. What is being offered here is very great. It is a turning point in life. It is a new beginning. It is a brand new education. It asks the participant to become a beginner, to become humble and open, to become trusting and yet discerning, to value experience over ideas, and to allow unanswered questions to be unanswered and unresolved problems to be unresolved and unrequited expectations to be unrequited.</p>
<p>因此，当你向他人呈现大社区内识之路或本书中的想法时，给他们时间去理解这里提供的内容。这里提供的教导非常伟大。它是生命的转折点。它是一个新的开始。它是一个全新的教育。它要求参与者成为一名初学者，变得谦逊和开放，变得信任但又有判断力，重视经验而非想法，让未解答的问题成为未解答，未解决的问题成为未解决，未实现的期望成为未实现。</p>
<p>When people share The Way of Knowledge with others, often they are shocked to find that people are not as open as they thought they were. They are shocked to find that people are resistant or concerned or anxious or uncomfortable. If this Teaching were not great and comprehensive, there would not be this response. But because it is real and substantive, the recipient has only three choices in how they can respond: They can go towards the Teaching, they can go away from it or they can fight against it. In the face of Knowledge, the mind can only do one of these three things. A few come forward, a few fight, and most try to find escape. This reveals people’s general position in life, regardless of the impression that they try to make to the contrary.</p>
<p>当人们与他人分享内识之路时，他们常常会震惊地发现，人们并不像他们想象的那样开放。他们震惊地发现，人们有抵触、担忧、焦虑或不舒服。如果这个教导不是伟大而全面的，就不会有这种反应。但是，因为它是真实而实质性的，接受者只有三种选择来回应：他们可以走向教导，他们可以远离教导，他们可以对抗教导。面对内识，心灵只能做这三件事中的一件。少数人挺身而出，少数人抗争，而大多数人试图逃避。这揭示了人们在生命中的总体位置，无论他们试图给人留下什么相反的印象。</p>
<p>You will find that some people who appear very certain, very self-satisfied and very strong and willful will fade quickly in the presence of Knowledge. You will find, perhaps, others who seem weak, humble and unassuming to be able to assume the great preparation that is being offered here. Here sometimes it seems that the strong are really weak, and the weak are really strong. That is a curious thing. But what is strength really? Is strength will power—an attempt to dominate life to make it give you what you want or control the experience of others so that they will render to you what you desire from them? Is that strength? Or is strength an ability to discern something that is true and to respond to it? Is strength the ability to give your life to something that is real and genuine while others become frightened and run for cover? And are a bright intellect and a strong philosophy the real precursors to Knowledge or do they serve to replace Knowledge?</p>
<p>你会发现，一些看上去非常自信、非常自满、非常强大和任性的人，在内识面前会很快消失。或许，你会发现，其他人看上去很软弱、谦卑和谦逊，能够承担这里提供的伟大准备。这里有时看起来的强者真的很软弱，而弱者真的很强大。这是件奇怪的事。但力量到底是什么？力量是意志力吗——一种试图主宰生命，让生命给你你想要的东西，或控制他人的体验，这样他们就会给你你想要的东西？这是力量吗？或者力量是一种辨别真正的内识并对其做出回应的能力？力量是一种将你的生命奉献给一种真实和真诚内识的能力，而其他人则变得害怕并寻求庇护？聪明的才智和强大的哲学是内识的真正先导吗？还是它们只是用来取代内识？</p>
<p>Who can learn The Way of Knowledge but that person who is experiencing a greater need—a need that cannot be fulfilled by the pleasures and rewards of the world—and whose sense of reality is different from other people’s sufficiently that they feel the movement and the direction of the world despite the many happy and fearful projections that people make about their own time and about the times to come?</p>
<p>除了那些正在经历更伟大需求的人（这种需求无法通过世界上的快乐和回报来满足），以及那些对现实的感知与其他人截然不同的人之外，还有谁可以学习内识之路，尽管人们对他们自己的时代和未来时代做出了许多快乐和恐惧的预测，但他们能感受到世界的运动和方向吗？</p>
<p>Sharing The Way of Knowledge, then, is a lesson in discernment for the giver and a real confrontation with the truth for the receiver. Now, it must be understood at the outset that this Teaching is not for everyone. But who can tell? Upon hearing this, certain people will say, “Oh, well, it couldn’t be for me then!” Not everyone can do and practice what The Way of Knowledge provides and presents. Some must find another way, an easier way perhaps. Others have another way altogether. Who can tell but the Unseen Ones? Some of those who run from Knowledge are meant to become its students. Others who claim affinity with Knowledge cannot even begin the preparation. Who can tell? Here it is better not to judge. It is better to see how people act and how they demonstrate their position in life in contrast to their thoughts, their declarations or their position with others.</p>
<p>因此，分享内识之路，对于给予者来说是一堂辨别课，对于接受者来说是一次与真理的真正对抗。现在，一开始就必须理解，这个教导并不适合所有人。但谁又能说得准呢？听到这句话，有些人会说：“哦，那它就不适合我了！”不是每个人都能做到并实践内识之路提供和呈现的步骤。有些人必须找到另一种方式，也许是更简单的方式。其他人则有完全不同的方式。除了不可见者，谁能说得准呢？一些逃避内识的人注定要成为它的学生。其他声称与内识有亲和力的人甚至无法开始准备。谁能说得准呢？在这里最好不要评判。最好看看人们如何行动，以及他们如何展示他们在生命中的位置，而不是他们的思想、他们的宣言或他们在他人眼中的位置。</p>
<p>The giver of The Way of Knowledge, then, has to face a fundamental reality, a reality that must be recognized and considered deeply. People are not what they seem, and only in the face of a real challenge and a real opportunity in life will you see how people will really go. Everyone wants to look good in the world, according to their values and their standards. Everyone wants to demonstrate what they truly believe and value. But does this make them weak or strong, capable or incapable, responsible or irresponsible?</p>
<p>因此，内识之路的传授者必须面对一个根本的现实，一个必须被深刻认识和思考的现实。人们并非他们表面上所表现的那样，只有面对生命中真正的挑战和真正的机会，你才能看到人们真正会走向何方。每个人都想根据他们的价值观和标准在世界上表现出色。每个人都想展示他们真正相信和重视的事情。但这会让他们变得软弱或强大、有能力或无能、负责任或不负责任吗？</p>
<p>Do not judge. Just watch and see. Those who will be able to begin to study The Way of Knowledge and to begin to build a foundation of Knowledge within their life will come forward sooner or later, for there is nowhere else for them to go. They can try another approach that seems more in keeping with their ideas and seems easier or more pleasurable. Or they may go and think about it for a long time until they can come to terms with their real needs and yearnings.</p>
<p>不要评判。只是观察和看。那些能够开始学习内识之路并在生命中开始建立内识基础的人迟早会走上前来，因为他们没有其他地方可去。他们可以尝试另一种似乎更符合他们的想法、似乎更容易或更愉快的方法。或者他们可能会去思考很长时间，直到他们能够接受他们真正的需求和渴望。</p>
<p>The situation is made even more difficult by the fact that people actually think that they can determine what is right for them based upon their wishes alone. If people could really determine what is right for them, you would not see the degree of human error that exists in the world today. So either people cannot tell what is right for them at all or they need a different set of criteria. They need a Greater Power within themselves.</p>
<p>情况变得更加困难，因为人们实际上认为他们能够仅基于他们的愿望来决定什么对他们是正确的。如果人们真的能够决定什么对他们是正确的，你就不会看到当今世界存在的人为错误程度。因此，要么人们根本无法分辨什么对他们是正确的，要么他们需要一套不同的标准。他们需要他们自己内心的一个更伟大的力量。</p>
<p>Do not be shocked or ashamed when others reject or deny your gift. Understand what you are really offering them. You are offering them the ultimate challenge. You are offering them a confrontation with themselves. You are offering them a method by which they can become fully honest with themselves and by which they can realize the extent of their past dishonesty. You are giving them a means to change or renew their life and to leave behind, in part or in whole, the life that they have built thus far. You are giving them a means that will challenge their beliefs and ideals in order to bring them to the real foundation of truth within themselves.</p>
<p>当他人拒绝或否认你的礼物时，不要感到震惊或羞愧。要理解你真正在向他们提供的内识。你在向他们提供终极挑战。你在向他们提供一次与他们自己的对峙。你在向他们提供一种方法，通过这种方法，他们可以对他们自己完全诚实，并认识到他们过去不诚实的程度。你在给他们一种改变或更新他们生命的方法，让他们部分或全部地抛弃他们迄今为止所建立的生命。你在给他们一种挑战他们的信仰和理想的方法，以便将他们带到他们自己内心的真理的真正基础。</p>
<p>Therefore, if they respond with anxiety, resistance or suspicion, do not take this personally. Keep in mind what you are offering them. They are responding to what you are offering, not to you. Perhaps they are critical and think that you are not a hero or a heroine and only a hero or a heroine could present something of real merit and value. You hear people say after attending a lecture, “Well, the speaker wasn’t really very good!” or “I liked what they said about this but not about that.” When people are talking like this, you have to wonder if they ever heard anything, if they really felt anything.</p>
<p>因此，如果他们表现出焦虑、抵触或怀疑，不要太在意。记住你给他们提供了内识。他们是在回应你提供的内识，而不是回应你。也许他们很挑剔，认为你不是英雄或女英雄，只有英雄或女英雄才能展现真正的优点和价值。你会听到人们在听完讲座后说：“好吧，演讲者讲得不是很好！”或“我喜欢他们说的这个，但不喜欢那个。”当人们这样说话时，你不得不怀疑他们是否听到了内识，是否真的感受到了内识。</p>
<p>You will be evaluated and judged as a contributor of Knowledge, but you are not expected to be a hero or a heroine. You are not expected to have the perfect words, the perfect presentation or to be immaculate yourself. All that is required is that you respond to something greater, that you recognize that it is important, even if you cannot understand what it means, and that you be willing to share it with others.</p>
<p>你将作为内识的贡献者被评估和评判，但你不会被期待成为英雄或女英雄。你不会被期待拥有完美的话语、完美的表达或完美无瑕的自我。所需要的只是你对一种更伟大的内识做出回应，你认识到它很重要，即使你无法理解它意味着什么，并且你愿意与他人分享它。</p>
<p>People are revealing more about themselves than about you in how they respond to this offer. But it is important not to judge them, for how can you judge them when you do not know what they have been through, or where they are in their own life and development, and how close or far away they are from Knowledge? You cannot tell. When you cannot tell, you should not try to make a determination. You will be fooled and disappointed if you do, for the person who you thought was so interested and so ready for something real shies away when a real opportunity comes, does not respond and does not hear or feel the offer when it is made. And yet another person who seems not to be remarkable in their interest in learning The Way of Knowledge is simply able to begin and to stay with it. And you fall back on yourself and you say, “Well, how strange this is! This person seems so right for this, but they could not do it! And this other person just began, without any prompting from me.”</p>
<p>人们在回应这个提议时，更多地透露了他们自己而不是你。但重要的是不要评判他们，因为当你不知道他们经历过什么，不知道他们处于他们自身生命的位置和发展阶段，也不知道他们距离内识有多近或多远时，你怎么能评判他们呢？你无法判断。当你无法判断时，你不应该试图做出决定。如果你这样做，你会被愚弄和失望，因为你认为那个对真正的事情如此感兴趣并准备好的人，在真正的机会来临时却退缩了，没有回应，也没有听到或感受到这个提议。而另一个似乎对学习内识之路兴趣不大的人，却能够开始并坚持下去。你回到你自己身上，说：“好吧，这太奇怪了！这个人看起来很适合这个，但他们做不到！而另一个人刚刚开始，没有我的任何提示。”</p>
<p>Presenting The Way of Knowledge will teach you valuable lessons in learning discernment and discretion. It will show you that when you are presenting something of real value and merit, people respond in one of three ways. And their response will reveal more about them than perhaps you could have seen before. Perhaps you are offering them the right thing at the wrong time, or you are offering them the wrong thing at the right time. When you offer them the right thing at the right time, there is an instant connection. When you offer the right thing at the wrong time, the connection will happen later. When you offer the wrong thing at the right time, well, you simply have not given them the opportunity that they need. Yet how can you tell what opportunities they really need unless you have been watching their life from the first moment? You have not, so do not make this determination. Give the gift and let those who are ready begin. And those who are not ready can go their way without condemnation. You cannot tell why they are not ready.</p>
<p>呈现内识之路将教会你宝贵的课程，让你学会辨别力和谨慎。它将向你展示，当你呈现真正有价值和功绩的内识时，人们会以三种方式之一做出回应。他们的回应将揭示出比你之前可能看到的更多的事情。也许你在错误的时间向他们提供了正确的事情，或者你在正确的时间向他们提供了错误的东西。当你在正确的时间向他们提供了正确的内识时，就会产生即时的联接。当你在错误的时间提供正确的事情时，联接将在稍后发生。当你在正确的时间提供错误的事情时，你只是没有给他们他们需要的机会。然而，除非你从一开始就关注着他们的生命，否则你怎么会知道他们真正需要什么机会呢？你没有，所以不要做这个决定。给予礼物，让那些准备好的人开始。而那些没有准备好的人可以走他们的路，而不受谴责。你无法说出他们为什么没有准备好。</p>
<p>The Creator offers The Way of Knowledge to everyone, in one form or another. A few are ready, and most do not respond. We can assure you that the Creator does not worry about them. Everyone will respond eventually, but eventually can be a long, long way in the future. Eventually, everyone will come to terms with themselves, but this can be a long way off. Meanwhile, the world is moving forward swiftly. Greater Community forces are in the world. Humanity is facing problems on a global level. And people are adrift, lost within their own minds.</p>
<p>造物主以这样或那样的形式向每个人提供内识之路。少数人已经做好准备，而大多数人没有回应。我们可以向你保证，造物主并不担心他们。每个人最终都会回应，但最终可能还要很长很长的时间。最终，每个人​​都会接受他们自己，但这可能还很遥远。与此同时，世界正在迅速前进。大社区的势力存在于这个世界上。人类正面临着全球层面的问题。人们迷失在他们自身的心灵中，迷失了方向。</p>
<p>Who can respond to a calling like this? Who can face the demands and the requirements of living a life of Knowledge? If most people knew what they were facing at the outset, they would say, “Oh, I am not up for this.” But they are. They need it. It is absolutely the perfect thing that will reveal their strength by calling upon their strength. It will reveal their dedication by calling upon their dedication. It will reveal their self-trust by calling upon their self-trust. It will reveal their ability to participate effectively with others by calling upon this ability. Only a method that calls upon the Greater Power within you will restore this power to you.</p>
<p>谁能回应这样的召唤？谁能面对过一种内识生命的要求和需求？如果大多数人一开始就知道他们面对的是什么，他们就会说：“哦，我不适合这个。”但他们适合。他们需要它。它绝对是完美的召唤，它将通过召唤他们的力量来揭示他们的力量。它将通过召唤他们的奉献来揭示他们的奉献。它将通过召唤他们的自我信任来揭示他们的自我信任。它将通过召唤这种能力来揭示他们有效参与他人的能力。只有一种召唤你内在更伟大力量的方法才能恢复你的这种力量。</p>
<p>Therefore, it is foolish to try to find the easy way, the comfortable way, the happy way, the way that is very pleasing or the way that does not trouble you or disturb you. If you could realize what the world needs from you and where the world is in its development, and if you could see the full extent of your own need, you would realize how important this is, how strong you must become, how united within yourself you must become and how close and bonded to the essential people in your life you must become. You would welcome this because you would see its value and you would see how necessary it is. You would see how weak humanity is and how this jeopardizes humanity’s future and well-being, not only in terms of its life within the world but in terms of its interaction with the Greater Community. The Greater Community will be represented by highly focused and united groups of individuals who are able to think with a united mind and focus, whose superiority is not only in technology but in the power of thinking and determination.</p>
<p>因此，试图寻找简单的道路、舒适的道路、幸福的道路、令人愉悦的道路或不让你烦恼或不安的道路是愚蠢的。如果你能意识到世界需要你的内识，世界处于发展阶段，如果你能看到你自身需求的全部范围，你就会意识到这有多么重要，你必须变得多么强大，你必须变得多么团结，你必须与你生命中的重要人物变得多么亲密和紧密。你会欢迎这一点，因为你会看到它的价值，你会看到它有多么必要。你会看到人类是多么软弱，这如何危及人类的未来和福祉，不仅是在世界范围内的生命，而且在它与大社区的互动方面。大社区将由高度专注和团结的个体群体代表，他们能够以统一的心灵和专注力思考，他们的优势不仅在于技术，还在于思维和决心的力量。</p>
<p>People want to feel that nothing is going on. They want to give themselves comfort and reassurance. They want to offset their discomfort within themselves, which is actually Knowledge calling them. They would rather be happy today and tomorrow, and so they look for whatever intoxicant, ideology or reassurance that will give them that which they desire because they do not want to know. They do not want to see. And they do not want to have to act. As a result, they will be the victims of the future and not the contributors to the future, for life will overtake them and they will not be prepared. And they will be bitter and resentful that their life turned out the way it did because they thought that it should have been otherwise.</p>
<p>人们想要感觉什么都没有发生。他们想要给他们自己安慰和保证。他们想要抵消他们内心的不适，而这实际上是内识在召唤他们。他们宁愿今天和明天快乐，因此他们寻找任何能给他们带来渴望的东西的麻醉品、意识形态或保证，因为他们不想知道。他们不想看到。他们不想不得不采取行动。结果，他们将成为未来的受害者，而不是未来的贡献者，因为生命将超越他们，而他们将没有做好准备。他们将对他们的生命变成这样感到痛苦和愤恨，因为他们认为生命本应是另外的样子。</p>
<p>Yet has life betrayed them or have they betrayed life? Has life turned against them in its hardships or have they merely been unable to respond to it? Life marches on. Humanity has a destiny and an evolution. The world is emerging into the Greater Community. Life is not waiting for people to make up their minds. It is marching forward. The Greater Community is not waiting for people to make up their minds. It is intervening. The natural physical world is not waiting for humanity to make up its mind. It is undergoing profound change.</p>
<p>然而，是生命背叛了他们，还是他们背叛了生命？是生命在艰难困苦中背叛了他们，还是他们只是无法回应生命？生命正在前进。人类有一个天命和一个进化。世界正在步入大社区。生命并不在等待人们下定决心。它在前进。大社区并不在等待人们下定决心。它在干预。自然的物质世界并不在等待人类下定决心。它在经历深刻的改变。</p>
<p>When you begin to awaken, one of the first things you realize upon awakening is your predicament. It is not a happy awakening, necessarily. Yes, it is a great relief to finally feel what you really feel and to know what you really know. Yet what you see at the beginning is your predicament, and you say, “Oh, no! Oh, my God!” You feel it, and you know it, and it is powerful. And you ask yourself, “Am I just being negative? Am I just being fearful? Or is it really like this?” It is really like this.</p>
<p>当你开始醒来时，你首先意识到的事情之一就是你的困境。它不是一种快乐的觉醒。是的，终于感受到你真正的感受，知道你真正知道的内识，这是一种极大的解脱。然而，你一开始看到的是你的困境，你会说：“哦，不！哦，我的天！”你感觉到了，你知道了，它是强大的。你问你自己：“我只是消极了吗？我只是害怕了吗？还是真的这样？”它实际上就是这样。</p>
<p>If you forget to pay your bills for a few years and then one day you remember that you should pay your bills, it will be quite a mess! Humanity has not been responding for a long time. When humanity realizes it must respond, it will be quite a mess. You won’t have the luxury of sitting around and thinking about what to do. You will have to do something. You will be called into action. You will be brought back into duty in life. That is good for you and good for life. And it is necessary for the future of humanity.</p>
<p>如果你几年都忘了付账，然后有一天你想起你应该付账，那将是一件相当混乱的事情！人类已经很久没有做出回应了。当人类意识到必须做出反应时，情况将变得相当混乱。你将没有时间坐下来思考该做什么。你必须做点什么。你将被要求采取行动。你将重新承担起生命中的责任。这对你和生命都有好处。这对人类的未来也是必要的。</p>
<p>When you share The Way of Knowledge with others, even if you do nothing more than say, “Read this,” or “Consider this idea,” you are challenging them to awaken, which is a difficult process in and of itself. You are challenging them to throw off the weight of seemingly endless dreaming and speculation and to awaken into a situation where there is great disorder in the world and great suffering as well. You are asking them to do this when you present The Way of Knowledge. You are giving them the greatest challenge, and you are giving them the ultimate gift.</p>
<p>当你与他人分享内识之路时，即使你只是说“读一下”或“考虑一下这个想法”，你也在挑战他们的觉醒，这本身就是一个艰难的过程。你在挑战他们摆脱看似无休止的梦境和猜测的重担，并觉醒到一个世界充满混乱和痛苦的境地。当你展示内识之路时，你就是在要求他们这样做。你在给他们最伟大的挑战，你在给他们终极的礼物。</p>
<p>You see, the Plan of the Creator calls for people to awaken each other. Now, a few people have to be awakened by the Unseen Ones in order to start this process and to keep it going because people keep falling back to sleep. Someone has to keep ringing the bell! Someone has to keep turning on the lights and rolling up the shades. It is like waking in the morning, and oh, you are so tired. And you open one eye and you say, “No, forget it!”</p>
<p>你看，造物主的计划要求人们相互唤醒。现在，为了启动这个过程并让它继续下去，必须有一些人被不可见者唤醒，因为人们不断重新陷入沉睡。必须有人不停地敲钟！必须有人不停地开灯、拉窗帘。它就像早上醒来，哦，你太累了。你睁开一只眼睛说：“不，还是算了吧！”</p>
<p>Simply by offering someone to read something or to consider an idea related to The Way of Knowledge, to show someone this writing and to share with them our words, which are for them as well, you are giving them the ultimate challenge and the ultimate gift. Yet do not think the angels will somehow arouse them from their sleepiness. It takes people to awaken people. It takes people to inspire people. It takes people to encourage people. It takes people to challenge people. It takes people to support people.</p>
<p>只需让某人阅读或思考与内识之路相关的想法，向某人展示这篇文章并与他们分享我们的话语（这些话语也适用于他们），你就在给予他们终极挑战和终极礼物。然而，不要认为天使会以某种方式唤醒他们。需要人们唤醒人们。需要人们激励人们。需要人们鼓励人们。需要人们挑战人们。需要人们支持人们。</p>
<p>Remember, this is not spiritual welfare. Life is not a big welfare line, doling out dispensations from Heaven. The dispensation from Heaven has already been given, for you all have Knowledge. It is waiting for you. It is calling upon you. It will ask you to give to others. And you will share with others your own realization, and you will give others the opportunity to study what you are studying and to consider what you are considering. Here people will reveal to you how they really are at this moment, but you must know that you cannot judge them, for today they may say, “No, never! Impossible! I would never do such a thing as study something like this.” And yet in a week, a month, or a year from now, they may come back and say, “You know, those things you told me, I have been thinking about them. I think they may be very important for me.” And then others may say, “Oh, of course! This is holy. This is spiritual. This is wonderful. I love this!” But they do not last a week as students. They cannot even begin. They are on to the next thing. They cannot give themselves. They cannot dedicate themselves.</p>
<p>记住，这不是精神福利。生命不是一条巨大的福利线，从天堂发放恩赐。天堂的恩赐已经赐予，因为你们都有内识。它正在等待你。它正在召唤你。它会要求你给予他人。你会与他人分享你自己的领悟，你会给他人机会去研究你正在研究的讯息，思考你正在思考的事情。在这里，人们会向你揭示他们此刻的真实情况，但你必须知道，你不能评判他们，因为今天他们可能会说：“不，绝不可能！不可能！我永远不会做这样的事情，研究这样的讯息。”然而，一周、一个月或一年后，他们可能会回来说：“你知道，你告诉我的那些事情，我一直在思考它们。我认为它们对我来说可能非常重要。”然后其他人可能会说：“哦，当然！这是神圣的。这是精神的。这很棒。我喜欢这个！”但他们作为学生连一个星期都坚持不了。他们甚至无法开始。他们正在做下一件事。他们无法给予他们自己。他们无法献出他们自己。</p>
<p>When people oppose The Way of Knowledge, they are not able to go away from it because they are attracted to it. But they are not able to give themselves to it, either, so they have only one alternative left, which is to fight it. This is strange because if it were not right for them, they could simply walk away. But they cannot walk away. They want it and they don’t want it. They are drawn to it, but they will not let themselves have it. They need it, but they do not want to need it. They do not want to deal with what it means. What it means is that they have been sent here for a purpose, this purpose is calling upon them and they need to respond.</p>
<p>当人们反对内识之路时，他们无法摆脱它，因为他们被它吸引。但他们也无法将他们自己交给它，所以他们只剩下一个选择，那就是与之抗争。这很奇怪，因为如果这条路不适合他们，他们可以直接走开。但他们走不了。他们想要它，他们又不想要它。他们被它吸引，但他们不会让他们自己得到它。他们需要它，但他们不想需要它。他们不想处理它意味着什么。这意味着他们被派到这里是为了一个目的，这个目的在召唤他们，他们需要回应。</p>
<p>Some people treat life as if they were on a holiday. Do they want to get a message from home saying it is time to go back to work? It is time to work where you are. Some people think that their relationship with the Creator is basically a welfare situation. Do they want their welfare check denied and a work order sent instead? And those people who long for contact with the Unseen Ones and who think it is their right and privilege to have an audience with the angels of the Creator, how will they respond when they are simply called into duty? What will they do when they receive a message one day that says, “You are ready. It is time to go to work now,” while they were hoping for a beautiful and ecstatic interaction and interlude with the Spiritual Presences of life. And what they get is a work order! They get drafted by God! They get called out of their frustrating personal life, to which they are trying to accustom themselves, and they have to go do something else entirely different.</p>
<p>有些人把生命当成度假。他们想从家里收到一条讯息，说是时候回去工作了吗？是时候在你所在的地方工作了。有些人认为他们与造物主的关系基本上是一种福利状况。他们想拒绝他们的福利支票，而是收到工作命令吗？那些渴望与不可见者接触，认为觐见造物主的天使是他们的权利和特权的人，当他们被召唤去履行职责时，他们会如何回应？当他们有一天收到一条讯息说：“你准备好了。现在是时候去工作了”，而他们原本希望与生命的精神存在进行美好而狂喜的互动和插曲时，他们会怎么做。他们得到的是工作命令！他们被上帝征召了！他们被召唤离开令人沮丧的个人生命，他们正试图适应这种生命，他们必须去做一些完全不同的事情。</p>
<p>People pray for peace and resolution. They pray for guidance and meaning. And when it comes, who wants it? When you are in the hole that you have fallen into, and all is dark and encompassing you, and you pray, and you have visions of spiritual beatitudes and angelic forces and wonderful experiences, and what you get as a response is a ladder, which is what you need, can you realize that that is the answer? Do you see the difference between what you want and what you need? This requires honesty. It is so obvious, but who can see it? It is so genuine, but who can value it? It is so real, but who can touch it?</p>
<p>人们祈求和平与决心。他们祈求指引与意义。当这些来临的时候，谁会想要呢？当你陷入深渊，一切都被黑暗包围，你祈祷，你看到了精神上的祝福、天使的力量和奇妙的经历，而你得到的回应是一架梯子，而这正是你所需要的，你能意识到这就是答案吗？你能看到你想要的和你需要的之间的区别了吗？这需要诚实。它是如此明显，但谁能看到它？它是如此真诚，但谁能珍惜它？它是如此真实，但谁能触摸它？</p>
<p>Even those who think they might be ready to give themselves in service to life and to humanity, how do they know they are up for the task? That is why everyone needs to build a foundation. If you cannot build a foundation, you cannot have the mission. Building the foundation is not simply suffering, being confused and frustrated and struggling with yourself. That is simply being confused and suffering within yourself. Can you build a foundation? Everyone has to build a foundation. This is so evident because you cannot assume a greater life in your current state of mind and in your current situation. You cannot put a great structure on a weak foundation. You cannot give great things to a person that cannot experience them, carry them, hold them and protect them.</p>
<p>即便是那些认为他们可能已经准备好给予他们自己去服务的生命和人类的人，他们怎么知道他们能胜任这个任务呢？正因为如此，每个人都需要构建一个基础。如果你不能构建一个基础，你就无法完成使命。建立基础不仅仅是痛苦、困惑、沮丧和自我挣扎。它只是内心的困惑和痛苦。你能建立一个基础吗？每个人都必须建立一个基础。这是显而易见的，因为在你当前的心灵状态和当前的处境中，你无法设想一种更伟大的生命。你无法在一个薄弱的基础上建立起一个伟大的结构。你无法把伟大的内识交给一个无法体验它们、承载它们、持有它们和保护它们的人。</p>
<p>People think they are stronger than they are or weaker than they are. Who really knows where they stand at the moment until something important is given to them, until an important challenge or opportunity comes their way and shows them where they really are and exposes their real strength and their real weakness in that moment? Many people do not want to know how weak they are, and so they avoid the encounter altogether. Others want to find out the real measure of their strength, and so they rise to the challenge.</p>
<p>人们总认为他们比实际更强大或更弱小。在重要的事情发生之前，在重要的挑战或机遇来临之前，谁能真正知道他们此刻的处境，并在那一刻暴露出他们真正的力量和真正的弱点？许多人不想知道他们有多软弱，因此他们完全回避这种遭遇。而另一些人则想知道他们真正的实力，因此他们勇于迎接挑战。</p>
<p>Life in the world has changed, yet humanity has not responded. The situation has become critical, and yet people act as if nothing were happening beyond their own personal interests. And as long as they have a job and are free to carry on their pleasurable hobbies, what does it matter? When people think like this, they are headed for catastrophe. They do not see the early warning signs of what is coming. They do not feel the inclinations and the signals from Knowledge. They are unresponsive to themselves and to the world, and they think their discomfort is simply a psychological problem. They pace the floor at night or they cannot sleep well. They have anxiety and think, “Oh, well, this is just my psychological problem.” And even to the extent that they can experience their response to this movement of the world, they misinterpret it.</p>
<p>世界上的生命已经改变，然而人类却没有做出回应。情况已经变得危急，然而人们却表现得好像除了他们自己的个人利益之外什么都没有发生。只要他们有一份工作，可以自由地从事他们令人愉快的爱好，那又有什么关系呢？当人们这样想时，他们正在走向灾难。他们看不到即将发生的事情的早期预警信号。他们感受不到来自内识的倾向和信号。他们对他们自己和世界没有回应，他们认为他们的不适只是一个心理问题。他们晚上在地上走来走去，或者他们睡不好觉。他们感到焦虑，并想：“哦，好吧，这只是我的心理问题。”即使他们能够体验到他们对世界这个运动的回应，他们也会误解它。</p>
<p>It takes very strong medicine to wake someone who will not awaken with a gentle prodding. They did not hear the alarm go off an hour ago. They are too involved in their dreams. What does it take to wake someone up when the house is on fire? You use a bucket of cold water if nothing else will work because you must arouse them. They are dreaming on, and the house is on fire. And they treat your awakening them as a great intrusion until they realize the seriousness of the situation. Then they look at you and they say, “I owe you my life!”</p>
<p>要唤醒那些轻轻一推就醒不过来的人，需要下猛药。他们一小时前没有听到警报响起。他们太沉迷于他们的梦境。如果房子着火了，要怎样才能把人唤醒呢？如果没有其他办法，你就用一桶冷水，因为你必须唤醒他们。他们正在做梦，而房子着火了。在他们意识到事情的严重性之前，他们会把你叫醒他们当作是一种巨大的打扰。然后他们看着你说：”我欠你一条命！”</p>
<p>As a person who presents The Way of Knowledge, you are awakening them by sharing an aspect of the message. And if they listen, you tell them more, without trying to persuade them. They either hear you or they don’t. If they cannot hear you, it does not matter how brilliant and sweet your words are. They will just treat it as entertainment. If they will not see and will not feel and will not know, then what do you do when the house is on fire?</p>
<p>作为一个传播内识之路的人，你通过分享讯息的一个方面来唤醒他们。如果他们聆听，你就告诉他们更多，而不是试图说服他们。他们要么听见，要么听不见。如果他们听不见，无论你的话多么精彩和甜蜜，都没有用。他们只会把它当作娱乐。如果他们看不到，感觉不到，也不知道，那么当房子着火时你会做什么？</p>
<p>In the world today, the house is burning slowly. Perhaps you can smell the smoke. Perhaps you can feel the tribulation in the world today. Much that concerns you has nothing to do with your psychology. Much that bothers you is not your own personal problems. This is not to say that everything that bothers you is not your personal problems, but often you are upset for reasons that you cannot understand. Perhaps there are no ideas associated with your feelings. You simply feel restless or agitated.</p>
<p>在当今世界，房子正在慢慢燃烧。也许你能闻到烟味。也许你能感受到当今世界的苦难。许多让你担心的事情与你的心理无关。许多困扰你的事情并不是你自己的个人问题。这并不是说所有困扰你的事情都不是你的个人问题，但你常常因为无法理解的原因而感到不安。也许你的感受与任何想法都无关。你只是感到不安或焦躁不安。</p>
<p>Remember, you are already connected to life. Before the storm, the animals change their behavior. They know something is coming. They do not read the weather report. They know something is happening. There is a great stillness all across the land. Is the little bird or the little mouse or the little bunny more intelligent than the human being, with their great intellect and their fantastic ideas? You would say, no, the animals are not more intelligent. But you would have to admit that they are more responsive.</p>
<p>记住，你已经与生命相连。暴风雨来临之前，动物们会改变他们的行为。它们知道暴风雨正在到来。它们不会看天气预报。它们知道暴风雨正在发生。整个大地一片寂静。小鸟、小老鼠或小兔子比人类更聪慧吗？人类拥有伟大的智慧和奇妙的想法。你会说，不，动物并不更聪明。但你必须承认，它们的反应更灵敏。</p>
<p>In the Greater Community, intelligence is measured in this way: It is the desire and ability to adapt and to respond to life. Now, with this definition of intelligence, humanity does not look like it is doing very well. Creating new gadgets and toys to play with does not represent intelligence if you are not responding to the environment and to your deeper inclinations. The mind is not working in service to the Spirit if it cannot respond to the Spirit and if it cannot respond to the body—either your personal body or the body of nature. And what merit is there in having a wonderful philosophy if you cannot feel the movement of your own life. When presented with The Greater Community Way of Knowledge, what value is there in having wonderful spiritual ideas, beliefs and assumptions if you miss the opportunity for preparation altogether.</p>
<p>在大社区，智能是这样衡量的：它是适应和回应生命的渴望和能力。现在，按照这种智能的定义，人类看起来做得并不好。如果你不回应环境和你更深层次的倾向，那么创造新的小玩意和玩具并不代表智能。如果心灵不能回应精神，不能回应身体——无论是你的个人身体还是自然的身体——那么它就不是在为精神服务。如果你无法感受到你自身生命的运动，那么拥有美妙的哲学又有什么价值呢？当面对大社区内识之路时，如果你完全错过了准备的机会，那么拥有美妙的精神想法、信仰和假设又有什么价值呢？</p>
<p>People think spiritual awakening is all bliss and happiness. Yes, there is a great relief. Yes, there is a great homecoming. But then you begin to experience the predicament that you and the world are in. And though you are not likely to become panicked or terrified, you will go to work very soon, and you will work continuously.</p>
<p>人们认为精神觉醒就是极乐和幸福。是的，这是一种伟大的解脱。是的，这是一种伟大的回家。但随后你开始体验你和世界所处的困境。虽然你不太可能感到恐慌或害怕，但你很快就会开始工作，而且会持续工作。</p>
<p>It is very late for people now. There is no time to spare. For those who are truly engaged in their service to the world, who have already built the necessary foundation for great work to be given to them, they cannot take great vacations. They do not give themselves a lot of time out. They must work and work consistently. They don’t have their guaranteed vacation weeks every year. They know they are privileged to do the real work. They know that their time and energy is extremely valuable. They know that their talents and abilities, however limited, have real service and merit. They know other people are depending upon them in their community. They know that the world is depending upon them and their Spiritual Family is depending upon them. You will not see these individuals giving themselves the kind of privileges and respites from life that others do so easily.</p>
<p>现在对人们来说已经很晚了。没有时间可以浪费。对于那些真正致力于服务世界的人，对于那些已经为赋予他们的伟大工作构建了必要基础的人，他们无法享受美好的假期。他们不会给他们自己太多的休息时间。他们必须工作，持续地工作。他们没有每年保证的假期周。他们知道他们有幸去做真正的工作。他们知道他们的时间和能量极其宝贵。他们知道他们的才华和能力，无论多么有限，都有真正的服务和价值。他们知道社区里的其他人依赖着他们。他们知道世界依赖着他们，他们的精神家庭依赖着他们。你不会看到这些人像其他人那样轻易地给予他们自己特权和生命喘息的机会。</p>
<p>When you become aware, you become aware of the world and you become aware of yourself—the beauty and the grandeur of the world and of yourself and the terrible tribulation within the world and within yourself. Your experience is heightened in all directions. You do not simply become aware of the good and deaf to what is not good. People’s expectations of a spiritual life are so out of keeping with the reality of a spiritual life that for many this keeps them from even beginning the preparation. They would rather be content in their happy assumptions than to find out the truth about the situation. They do not want to think that the world isn’t so pretty, for this means they will have to do something. They will have to respond. They would rather have happier thoughts and think, “Well, God is taking care of everything. I give it all to the Holy Spirit.” In reality, God is looking at you and saying, “You are supposed to take care of matters down there,” and the Holy Spirit knows this and is here to empower you to do it. Why do people not understand God’s work and presence in the world? The great difference in God’s approach and people’s expectations account for part of it.</p>
<p>当你变得察觉时，你就会察觉到这个世界，也会察觉到你自己——世界和你自己的美丽与壮观，以及世界和你自己内部的可怕磨难。你的体验在各个方面都会得到提升。你不会仅仅意识到美好的事物，而对不美好的事物充耳不闻。人们对精神生命的期望与精神生命的现实相差甚远，以至于许多人甚至无法开始准备。他们宁愿满足于他们快乐的假设，也不愿找出情况的真相。他们不想认为这个世界并不那么美好，因为这意味着他们必须做点什么。他们必须做出回应。他们宁愿有更快乐的想法，并认为“好吧，上帝在照顾一切。我把一切都交给圣灵。”在现实中，上帝正看着你说，“你应该去处理下面的事情”，圣灵知道这一点，并在这里赋予你力量去做这件事。为什么人们不理解上帝在这个世界上的工作和存在？部分原因是上帝的做法和人们的期望有很大的差异。</p>
<p>Many people think spirituality is like ice cream and cookies, all happiness and relief. It is green pastures all the way! Heaven on Earth! Let’s all go to the beach, the spiritual beach! And we will try to forgive and forget the world and its darkness, its pain and its tragedy. We will try to overlook these things to see a happier world—the world we want to see, the happy world, the world that is a beach, the spiritual beach, where the angels will be dancing around us, and we will be so happy at last. And there will be no trial or tribulation, and no more trouble, and we will no longer feel this discomfort, this restlessness inside. We will find our true purpose, and it will be blissful and wonderful, and we will all congregate here in the green pasture, and we shall all be very happy.</p>
<p>许多人认为精神性就像冰淇淋和饼干，全是快乐和解脱。一路都是绿色的牧场！人间天堂！让我们都去海滩，精神的海滩！我们会试着原谅和忘记这个世界及其黑暗、痛苦和悲剧。我们会试着忽略这些事情，去看到一个更快乐的世界——我们想看到的世界，快乐的世界，海滩的世界，精神的海滩，天使们会在我们身边跳舞，我们最终会非常快乐。不会有考验或磨难，不会有麻烦，我们也不会再感到内心的不适和不安。我们会找到我们真正的目的，它将是幸福和美妙的，我们都将聚集在这片绿色的牧场上，我们都会非常快乐。</p>
<p>Can you see the contrast? Can you see the difference between what people want and what people know? Can you see the difference between what people believe about the world and what the world really is? The beauty in the world is neglected, but its tribulation is neglected as well. People look at the great problems of the world, and they say, “This is terrible! Someone must do something about this! The government should do something about this!” They do not feel personally responsible. They do not say, “Well, what am I going to do about this?” It is someone else’s problem. It is God’s problem. “Well, God is all powerful. God will take care of this. Probably at the last moment when everything is about to fail, something will happen and everything will be all right. All the problems will go away.” This thinking leads to catastrophe, both within the person, for their heart is denied, and within the world, for humanity is denied.</p>
<p>你能看到这种反差吗？你能看到人们想要的和人们知道的之间的区别吗？你能看到人们对世界的看法和世界的真实情况之间的区别吗？世界上的美好被忽视了，但它的苦难也被忽视了。人们看着世界上的大问题，说：“这太可怕了！必须有人做点什么！政府应该做点什么！”他们不觉得自己有责任。他们不会说：“好吧，我该怎么办？”这是别人的问题。这是上帝的问题。“好吧，上帝是万能的。上帝会处理好这件事的。很可能在最后一刻，当一切都即将失败时，就会发生一些事情，一切都会好起来。所有的问题都会消失。”这种想法会导致灾难，既发生在人的内心，因为他们的心被否定了，也发生在世界的内心，因为人类被否定了。</p>
<p>Eventually, if you build a foundation and learn The Way of Knowledge, you will gain a Greater Community perspective about the world, which is an ability to see the world from the outside looking in, as opposed to the inside looking out. You will be able to see your life from the outside looking in and not just from the inside looking out. You will see that the world that you live in is a very special world in the universe, that you have a veritable treasure house of biological wealth here and that there are not a lot of other places in the Greater Community as well endowed as this world. And yet humanity is ignorant of what it has. It is sitting on valuable real estate—real estate that others in the Greater Community most assuredly want for themselves. Perhaps if you were wise stewards of the world, they would respect your stewardship, but your stewardship has not been accepted and is certainly not being exercised very well. So, who from the Greater Community will think that your well-being is a priority when you are spoiling the very world you live in, which is considered an asset for the whole Greater Community?</p>
<p>最终，如果你建立了一个基础并学习了内识之路，你将获得一种大社区视角来看待世界，这是一种从外部看世界的能力，而不是从内部看世界。你将能够从外部看见世界，而不仅仅是从内部看到世界。你将看到你生活的世界是宇宙中一个非常特殊的世界，你们在这里拥有一个名副其实的生物财富宝库，大社区中没有多少其他地方像这个世界一样拥有如此丰富的资源。然而人类对他们自己拥有的财富一无所知。它坐拥宝贵的地产——大社区中的其他种族肯定想要的地产。也许如果你们是这个世界的明智管家，他们会尊重你们的管家职责，但你们的管家职责尚未被接受，而且肯定没有得到很好的行使。那么，当你们正在破坏你们所居住的世界（而这被视为整个大社区的财富）时，大社区的谁会认为你们的福祉是优先事项呢？</p>
<p>With a Greater Community perspective, you are able to see your situation not with anger and condemnation, but with clarity and perspective. You will be able to assess humanity’s advances and its shortcomings in light of the Greater Community. Humanity has never compared itself with other intelligent life, so it does not know how strong or weak it really is. The differences between people are not that great, and seen from the outside, all people are alike anyway. Some are wise; many are not. But the differences between people are not as great as the differences between you and other races in the Greater Community, who represent a great spectrum of intelligent life beyond what you can even consider.</p>
<p>有了大社区的视角，你就能够用清晰和透视的眼光看待人类的处境，而不是愤怒和谴责。你将能够根据大社区来评估人类的进步和不足。人类从未将它自己与其他智能生命进行比较，因此它不知道自己到底有多强或多弱。人与人之间的差异并不大，而且从外表看，所有人都差不多。有的人聪明，有的人不聪明。但是，人与人之间的差异并没有你们和大社区中其他种族之间的差异那么大，大社区中的其他种族所代表的智能生命的巨大范围甚至超出了你们所能考虑的范围。</p>
<p>We can assure you that they, though foreign to your world, your ways and your customs, will see your predicament more clearly than you do. Amongst humanity at this time, those individuals who do see the predicament must become strong with Knowledge, not only because of the difficulty of the problems involved and how much energy will be required to resolve them, but also because of the ambivalence and the indifference that people generate regarding their own situations. People have only demonstrated collective incentive in terms of solving problems in crisis situations. When the house is on fire, oh yes, everyone will help out. But then it is too late. By that time, on a global scale, it will be too late. Do you think that at the last minute you are going to pull it together? This is not like when you oversleep and get up late in the morning and yet you are somehow able to scramble and get to the job on time. That last-minute approach will not work here.</p>
<p>我们可以向你保证，尽管他们不了解你们的世界、你们的生活方式和你们的习俗，但他们比你们更清楚地看到你们的困境。在当今的人类中，那些看到困境的人必须拥有强大的内识，这不仅是因为所涉及的问题很困难，需要付出多大的努力才能解决这些问题，还因为人们对他们自身的处境产生了矛盾和冷漠。人们只在危机情况下表现出集体的激励来解决问题。当房子着火时，哦，是的，每个人都会伸出援手。但那时已经太晚了。到那时，在全球范围内，已经太晚了。你认为在最后一刻你会振作起来吗？这不像你睡过头，早上起床晚，但你却不知何故能够匆忙赶到工作地点。那种最后一刻的方法在这里行不通。</p>
<p>Many people in the world today are feeling restless. They feel the world is moving beneath their feet. Perhaps they think it is an economic shift or a political shift. Some people think it is a spiritual shift. It means you are getting ready for the Golden Age of Enlightenment! Others think that the world is going to turn itself upside down. They think that what is happening is a physical thing. And people interpret the movement they feel in many, many other ways. They feel it, but how can they see what it is? They know something is happening, but how do they determine what it is? So, the problem is felt, but it is evaluated according to everyone’s fixed ideas and beliefs. Some see a terrible catastrophe. Others see the dawning of a blissful age. Others see a new political world order or a new financial world order. And many others have no idea at all.</p>
<p>当今世界的许多人都感到焦躁不安。他们觉得世界正在他们脚下移动。也许他们认为这是经济的转变或政治的转变。有些人则认为这是精神上的转变。这意味着你们正在为启蒙的黄金时代做好准备！还有一些人认为，世界将发生翻天覆地的变化。他们认为正在发生的事情是物理现象。人们还用许多许多其他方式来解释他们所感受到的运动。他们感觉到了，但如何可以看到它是什么呢？他们知道有些事情正在发生，但他们如何确定那是什么？因此，问题是可以感觉到的，但根据每个人固定的想法和信念来评估。有些人看到的是一场可怕的灾难。另一些人则看到了幸福时代的来临。还有人看到了新的世界政治秩序或新的世界金融秩序。还有许多人对此一无所知。</p>
<p>The important point here is that people feel something is happening. Yet they must build a foundation in Knowledge to be able to really understand this because it must be known. Otherwise, you just project your ideas about it. If you believe that the world is on the verge of spiritual enlightenment, well, you will just see the evidence that that is the case. If you believe that extraterrestrial forces are going to land on the world and somehow rescue humanity from its great plight and teach us how to live in peace, well, you will think that everything represents that. If you think that humanity is all going to hell anyway, you will see evidence of that. Yet none of these interpretations represents Knowledge.</p>
<p>这里的重点是，人们感觉到有些事情正在发生。然而，他们必须在内识中打下基础，才能真正理解这一点，因为这必须被知晓。否则，你只是把你的想法投射到它上面。如果你相信世界正处于精神启蒙的边缘，那么，你只会看到事实的确如此的证据。如果你相信外星势力将降临世界，以某种方式拯救人类脱离困境，教导人类如何和平生活，那么，你会认为一切都代表了这一点。如果你认为人类无论如何都会走向地狱，你会看到这一点的证据。然而，这些解释都不能代表内识。</p>
<p>A great event happens in the Greater Community, and someone twitches on planet Earth. A great event happens on planet Earth, and someone can’t sleep at night and does not know why. You wake up one morning and you are very afraid, and it is irrational because there is no reason for it. You are connected to the world. You are connected to life. You are connected to what is happening in the Greater Community. You are connected to what is happening in your world. You are connected to what is happening in your family. And you are connected to what is happening to those individuals whom you are yet to meet who represent your Spiritual Family within the world. You are already included, so what is enlightenment but simply coming to terms with the reality of your life and calling upon the Greater Power inherent within you to enable you to do this? There is no drifting off in clouds with the angels.</p>
<p>大社区发生了一件大事，地球上有人抽搐。大社区发生了一件大事，地球上有人晚上睡不着觉，却不知道为什么。你一天早上醒来，感到非常害怕，这是不合理的，因为没有理由。你与世界相连。你与生命相连。你与大社区正在发生的事情息息相关。你与你的世界所发生的一切息息相关。你与你的家庭正在发生的事情息息相关。你与那些你尚未见过的、代表你在世界上的精神家庭的个体正在发生的事情相连。你已经被包括在内了，那么什么是启蒙，不就是简单地接受你生命的现实，并呼唤你内在的更伟大的力量来帮助你做到这一点吗？没有和天使一起飘在云端。</p>
<p>The world is like a slowly burning ship at this time. People want to get off the ship, but you are sent here to help the ship. If you go back prematurely to your Spiritual Family, and they say, “What are you doing here?” And you say, “Oh, I am so glad to get out of there! It was terrible down there!” And they say, “What? You aren’t due back for twenty years! Did you give them the messages?” And you say, “What messages?” Then you remember. Then you remember all about getting ready to go into the world. Then you remember the whole thing, and you say, “Oh, no! I completely forgot!”</p>
<p>此时的世界就像一艘缓慢燃烧的船。人们想下船，但你被派到这里来帮助这艘船。如果你过早地回到你的精神家庭，他们会说：“你在这里做什么？”你说：“哦，我很高兴离开那里！那里太可怕了！”他们会说：“什么？你二十年后才应该回来！你给他们讯息了吗？”你会说：“什么讯息？”然后你记起来了。然后你记起了所有关于准备进入世界的事情。然后你记起了整件事，你说：“哦，不！我完全忘了！”</p>
<p>Now, some people look at The Way of Knowledge and say, “Oh, well, it is not loving. I do not see anything about love. If it is not about love, then it is not spiritual.” Being spiritual is about everything. It is about being with everything, supporting the truth with everything. It is not about going to the beach and visiting green pastures and being happy, happy, happy all day long, like a child that just got put on permanent summer vacation with an endless expense account in Heaven.</p>
<p>现在，有些人看着内识之路说：“哦，好吧，它不是爱。我看不出任何关于爱的事情。如果它不是关于爱的，那么它就不是精神的。”精神是关于一切的。它是关于与一切共存，用一切来支持真理。它不是关于去海滩，参观绿色牧场，整天快乐、快乐、快乐，就像一个刚刚被安排去永久暑假的孩子，在天堂有无尽的支出账户。</p>
<p>The Way of Knowledge is not about being free from concern. It is about responding to concern. It is about responding with Knowledge, not with fear, not with hopelessness, not with helplessness, but with Knowledge. You are equipped to deal with the situation in the world. You have brought part of the provision for this into the world with you. You are like a paratrooper. You got dropped into the world with your kit, with all the supplies you need to make it down here and to help the world in the way that you were meant to help the world. But who can remember dropping out of the sky in the parachute? All of a sudden you are crammed into your mother’s womb and you are trying to work your way out. Who can remember the parachute part?</p>
<p>内识之路不是要摆脱忧虑，而是要回应忧虑。内识之路是用内识来回应，不是用恐惧、不是用绝望、不是用无助，而是用内识。你有能力应对这个世界的状况。你把部分为此准备的内识带到这个世界。你就像一名伞兵。你带着装备来到这个世界，带着所有你需要的补给品降落到这里，以你本该帮助世界的方式帮助世界。但谁能记得从天上掉下来的降落伞？突然间，你被塞进了母亲的子宫，你正试图挣脱出来。谁能记得降落伞的部分呢？</p>
<p>The people who are happy in the world are people who are doing something important for the world and have joined with other people to do this. They are the happy ones. No, they are not blissfully unaware. No, they are not smiling all day. No, they are not having a tea party throughout the course of their lives. Yet they experience a fulfillment and a sense of purpose and destiny that remains out of reach for others.</p>
<p>世界上幸福的人是那些为世界做着重要事情并与他人一起做这件事的人。他们是幸福的人。不，他们不是一无所知的幸福。不，他们不是整天微笑。不，他们不是一生都在开茶话会。然而，他们体验到了一种满足感和一种其他人无法企及的目的感和天命感。</p>
<p>Someone presented The Way of Knowledge to you. Present The Way of Knowledge to someone else. You cannot determine how they will respond, and how they will respond has more to do with what you are offering than with you yourself, particularly if you are humble in your presentation and do not try to convince or to persuade someone to offset your own discomfort. Give The Way of Knowledge because humanity needs to prepare. People need to go back and find where they left their parachute. They need to go back and find where they left their backpack because it had their plans and materials in it. This is going back to Knowledge, which has held all these things in secret for you, waiting for you to reach a sufficient stage of maturity where you can value and honor what you have brought with you into the world.</p>
<p>有人向你介绍了内识之路。向他人介绍内识之路。你无法决定他们会如何回应，而他们如何回应更多地与你提供的内识有关，而不是与你自己有关，特别是如果你在介绍中很谦虚，不试图说服或劝说别人来抵消你自己的不适。给予内识之路，因为人类需要做好准备。人们需要回去找到他们把降落伞放在哪里。他们需要回去找到他们把背包放在哪里，因为背包里有他们的计划和材料。这就是回到内识，它为你秘密保存了所有这些东西，等待你达到足够的成熟阶段，在那里你可以珍惜和尊重你带到这个世界的礼物。</p>
<p>You have had your personal time in the world. It has been wonderful and terrible. It has been a strange journey, but now it is time to do the real work. Do not think that you know what this is yet, for you are not there yet. Even if you have found what it is, it will change. Do not give yourself false assumptions, but take the steps to Knowledge. You build the foundation and you take a long time doing it because this is what gives you the strength, the companionship and the Wisdom to be a man or a woman of Knowledge in the world and to be a true representative of the Divine.</p>
<p>你已经在这个世界上度过了属于你的时光。这段时光既美好又可怕。它是一段奇怪的旅程，但现在是时候开始真正的工作了。不要认为你已经知道内识是什么，因为你还没有到达内识。即使你已经找到了它是什么，它也会改变。不要给你自己错误的假设，而是开展内识的进阶。你建立基础，并花费很长时间去做，因为正是这赋予了你力量、陪伴和智慧，让你成为这个世界上拥有内识的男人或女人，成为神圣的真正代表。</p>
<p>Then when you go back to your Spiritual Family, they will look at you and you will look at them, and you will say, “Yes, I remembered. I remembered you all. I was lost for awhile, but I remembered.” And they will say to you, “Well, that is good because we were talking to you the whole time.”</p>
<p>然后当你回到你的精神家庭时，他们会看着你，你也会看着他们，你会说：“是的，我记得。我记得你们所有人。我迷失了一段时间，但我记得。”他们会对你说：“嗯，这很好，因为我们一直在与你说话。”</p>
