<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 12, 1994 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1994 年 10 月 12 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every great life must have a strong foundation, and in almost all cases this foundation takes a very long time to establish. You yourself are in the process of developing this foundation, and the extent to which you do so and your success in doing so will determine what kind of life can be established and how it can be maintained.</p>
<p>每一个伟大的生命都必须有一个坚实的基础，而这个基础几乎在所有情况下都需要很长的时间才能建立起来。你自己正在建立这个基础，你建立的程度和你成功的程度将决定你能建立什么样的生命以及如何维持它。</p>
<p>Those who have come upon the realization of their purpose too soon have rarely had the capacity to sustain and support such a life, and their greater gifts could not be rendered even though they showed real promise at the outset.</p>
<p>那些过早实现他们目的的人，很少有能力维持和支撑这样的生命，即使他们一开始就表现出真实的承诺，但他们无法提供更伟大的礼物。</p>
<p>As you have built a foundation for your personal life in the world through many years of development and learning, you also develop a foundation for your greater life and purpose through many years of preparation and learning. Patience here is very important as well as great faith. Faith is essential because you cannot see the result of your actions at the outset. You cannot understand what you are preparing for. You do not see what will be built upon the foundation that you are building now, and so it seems like a long and arduous task to establish the foundation that you will need for your life. Yet this foundation is necessary and cannot be avoided. You cannot simply have the result without preparing for it. You cannot simply have the reward without earning it and without developing the ability to sustain and support it.</p>
<p>正如你通过多年的发展和学习为你在这个世界上的个人生命打下基础一样，你也要通过多年的准备和学习为你更伟大的生命和目的打下基础。在这里，耐心和伟大的信仰非常重要。信仰是至关重要的，因为你无法在一开始就看到你行动的结果。你无法理解你在为何做准备。你看不到在你现在打下的基础上将会建造什么，因此建立你生命所需要的基础似乎是一项漫长而艰巨的任务。然而，这个基础是必要的，也是无法回避的。你不可能不为结果做准备就简单地得到结果。你无法简单的得到回报而不用去赢得它，并且不去培养支撑和维持它的能力。</p>
<p>Whatever you establish in your life is only as strong as the foundation underneath it, and that is why the foundation is the most important part. Once your foundation in life becomes strong, then great things can be added to it and built upon it, and these things will stand. They will then be able to weather and endure the tribulations of life and the winds of change as well.</p>
<p>你在生命中建立的一切，其坚固程度取决于它下面的基础，这就是为什么基础是最重要的部分。一旦你生命中的基础变得牢固，那么就可以在它上面添加和建造伟大的事物，这些事物就会屹立不倒。这样，它们就能经受住生命的磨难和变革之风的考验。</p>
<p>Building a foundation, then, is essential, and this is where we must start. Many people are too impatient to involve themselves in this in a conscious way. They seek to have the result as soon as possible. Be very careful here, for a great structure will not stand and will not provide benefit if it does not have the foundation that is necessary. It will collapse. It must be supported and sustained.</p>
<p>因此，打下基础是至关重要的，我们必须从这里开始。许多人太急躁，无法有意识地参与其中。他们寻求尽快得到结果。在这里要非常小心，因为如果没有必要的基础，伟大的结构将无法屹立，也无法带来益处。它会倒塌。它必须得到支持和维持。</p>
<p>Within your personal make-up you must have character and capacity. Let us describe these things now. Character is built by becoming strong and determined, patient and observant. Character is not personality. Character is an abiding strength, the willingness to wait, a focused determination, and a patient approach. These are the elements of character. This is where your personal mind becomes strong enough to become a vehicle for Knowledge.</p>
<p>在你的个人构成中，你必须具备品格和能力。现在让我们来描述一下这些。品格是通过变得坚强、果断、有耐心和善于观察来建立的。品格不是个性。品格是一种持久的力量、等待的意愿、专注的决心和耐心的态度。这些是品格的要素。这就是你的个人心灵变得足够强大，成为内识载体的地方。</p>
<p>Character-building is at the level of the personal mind, which is the mind that you have acquired since you have come into the world. Your personal mind must become strong. It cannot establish purpose, meaning and direction in life, and it cannot be the foundation for a greater life to be established and contributed here in the world. And the personal mind alone certainly cannot withstand the changes in the world today and the world’s emergence into the Greater Community. For this you need a greater foundation. You need a genuine foundation. You need a foundation that is established beyond the world, a spiritual foundation, that cannot be affected or influenced by the world with its many errors and its great confusion.</p>
<p>品格的塑造是在个人心灵层面上进行的，也就是你来到这个世界后所获得的心灵。你的个人心灵必须变得强大。它无法确立生命的目的、意义和方向，也无法成为在这个世界上建立和贡献更伟大生命的基础。单凭个人的心灵肯定无法抵御当今世界的变化，也无法抵御世界向大社区的迈进。为此，你需要一个更伟大的基础。你需要一个真正的基础。你需要一个建立在世界之外的基础，一个精神上的基础，它不能被这个错误百出、混乱不堪的世界所影响或左右。</p>
<p>Character, then, is a development of the person. With character you can begin to build a foundation and continue building it for as long as necessary. It may take the rest of your life, but every advancement here is permanent.</p>
<p>那么，品格就是人的发展。有了品格，你就可以开始打下基础，并在必要的时候继续打下基础。它可能需要你一生的时间，但这里的每一个进步都是永久的。</p>
<p>With character, you will have the capacity to wait for Knowledge, to discern Knowledge, to experience Knowledge and to carry out the direction of Knowledge in your life. This capacity is part of your foundation. If you do not have it, no matter how much you may want truth, peace and meaning in your life, you will not have the ability to experience them, and you certainly will not have the capacity to maintain them.</p>
<p>有了品格，你将有能力等待内识、辨别内识、体验内识并在你的生命中贯彻内识的指引。这种能力是你基础的一部分。如果你没有它，无论你多么渴望生命中的真理、和平与意义，你都将没有能力去体验它们，你当然也没有能力去维护它们。</p>
<p>Building character and building capacity go together, for you must learn to wait for many things. Here it is very important to leave your life undefined because it is slowly taking shape. Here you must have faith that a Greater Power is at work in your life within you and around you. You must have faith in the presence and the reality of this Greater Power without making it the cause of all your happy and unhappy events, of all your little successes and great tribulations. The Creator has given you Knowledge, and that is the great endowment. Find Knowledge and you will find your way. Avoid Knowledge and you will remain in confusion and fantasy. Follow The Way of Knowledge and you will build the foundation of your life. Follow another way, and you will attempt once again to follow a journey that has no end and no meaning.</p>
<p>品格的培养和能力的培养是相辅相成的，因为你必须学会​​等待许多事情。在这里，让你的生命保持未定义状态非常重要，因为它正在慢慢成形。在这里，你必须有信仰，在你的生命中，在你的内在和周围，有一个更伟大的力量在工作。你必须信仰这个更伟大力量的存在和现实，但不要让它成为你所有快乐和不快乐事件、所有小成功和大磨难的原因。造物主赋予了你内识，这是伟大的天赋。找到内识，你就会找到你的道路。逃避内识，你就会停留在困惑和幻想中。遵循内识之路，你就会构建你的生命基础。遵循另一条道路，你就会再次尝试踏上一条没有终点、没有意义的旅程。</p>
<p>Seen clearly, the choices are very simple but can be difficult to make because they are so substantive and complete. People often wish to remain in speculation and fantasy because it seems they have so many options available to them. They say to themselves, “Well, any way that I go is just fine! I will end up at my true destination, for all the roads lead to truth!” Do not say these things to yourself, for you are not taking seriously the real opportunities and decisions that you face in life. Roads lead off in all directions. You need to find the right one and stay with it.</p>
<p>显然，选择很简单，但做出选择却很难，因为它们太过实质性和完整。人们往往希望停留在猜测和幻想中，因为他们似乎有太多选择。他们对他们自己说：“好吧，无论我走哪条路都很好！我最终会到达真正的目的地，因为所有道路都通向真理！”不要对你自己说这些话，因为你没有认真对待你在生命中面临的实际机会和决定。道路通向四面八方。你需要找到正确的道路并坚持下去。</p>
<p>Your decision making here is crucial to your success. Never take it lightly and never assume that your decisions are not absolutely significant and important for the outcome of your life. The decisions you make today result in your life tomorrow. They determine what kind of decisions will be available to you tomorrow. Choose the way that has no destiny and no meaning, and you will spend your years trying to get back to where you started. But choose the way that is meant for you, the way that Knowledge within you will recognize and confirm, and every step you take will be a genuine step towards building a foundation for Knowledge and contribution.</p>
<p>你在这里做出的决策对于你的成功至关重要。永远不要掉以轻心，永远不要认为你的决策对于你的生命结果来说不是绝对显著和重要的。你今天做出的决定将影响你明天的生命。它们决定了你明天可以做出什么样的决定。选择一条没有天命、没有意义的道路，你将花费数年时间试图回到你开始的地方。但选择一条适合你的道路，选择你内心的内识所认可和确认的道路，你迈出的每一步都将是迈向建立内识和贡献基础的真正一步。</p>
<p>Building a foundation represents the fundamental work of spiritual development. Again, this is neglected because people, in their own imagination, want to see themselves in their final state, in their mature state, in an accomplished state. They want and expect this to happen. Perhaps they even demand it of the Creator. Perhaps they think they can create it by their will alone. And, therefore, they do their affirmations. They make their declarations and they place huge demands upon themselves and others. And though they pretend to pray, they demand instead that their wishes be fulfilled, and promptly as well. Yet they do not have the desire for truth, and they do not have the capacity to experience it or to face what it would mean for them in their own lives.</p>
<p>建立一个基础是精神发展的基本工作。同样，人们忽视了这一点，因为人们在他们自身的想象中希望看到他们自己处于最终状态、成熟状态和成就状态。他们希望并期待这种情况发生。也许他们甚至要求造物主这样做。也许他们认为他们可以仅凭他们的意志创造它。因此，他们做他们的肯定。他们发表宣言，对他们自己和他人提出巨大的要求。虽然他们假装祈祷，但他们却要求他们的愿望得到满足，而且要迅速实现。然而，他们没有对真理的渴望，也没有能力去体验真理或面对真理对他们自身生命的意义。</p>
<p>Once you take a wrong road in life, it is very hard to get back. And if you go too far, you will not get back. Do not dabble, then, with your life and your existence. Do not toy with relationships and with other endeavors, but seek to find that which is essential within you, for what is essential will give you what you want and will lead you in the right direction.</p>
<p>一旦你在生命中走错了路，就很难再回头了。如果你走得太远，你就回不来了。所以，不要拿你的生命和你的存在开玩笑。不要玩弄人际关系和其他努力，而是要努力寻找你最本质的的内识，因为最本质的内识会给你你想要的生命，会引导你走向正确的方向。</p>
<p>We do not promise grandiose things or easy accomplishments. No instant riches. No instant love. No instant meaning. No instant purpose. No instant accomplishment, as if you just add water or some other magical substance and you just have these things! These are the goals that the dreamers dream of, those who are lost in imagination. No, we offer a way. We offer the means. We offer the reality. And we offer the confirmation of Knowledge within you. Our words speak primarily to Knowledge within you. They call to Knowledge within you as your Knowledge calls to us, to this message, to this Teaching and to this greater truth.</p>
<p>我们不承诺宏伟的事情或轻而易举的成就。没有瞬间的财富。没有瞬间的爱。没有瞬间的意义。没有瞬间的目的。没有瞬间的成就，好像你只要加点水或其他神奇的物质，你就能拥有这些东西！这些是梦想家、那些迷失在想象中的人所梦想的目标。不，我们提供一条道路。我们提供方法。我们提供现实。我们提供你内在内识的确认。我们的话语主要针对你内在的内识。它们呼唤着你内在的内识，就像你的内识呼唤我们、呼唤这个讯息、这个教导和这个更伟大的真理一样。</p>
<p>In living in the world, there are Four Pillars of life. These are all part of your foundation building. They are the pillars of relationships, health, work and spiritual development. These are the cornerstones of your foundation in life. Development of the Four Pillars of life represents your day-to-day activity and your greater challenge in learning. Your activities in the world are primarily concerned with these categories, so we are talking about something you are doing already. The question is whether you are developing or not, for you must develop in each of the four areas. You cannot develop one to the exclusion of the others. You must develop them all.</p>
<p>生活在这个世界上，生命有四大支柱。这些都是你基础建设的一部分。它们是关系、健康、工作和精神发展的支柱。它们是你生命基础的基石。发展四大支柱代表着你的日常活动和学习中更大的挑战。你在世间的活动主要与这些类别有关，所以我们谈论的是你已经在做的事情。问题是你是否在发展，因为你必须在这四个领域中的每一个领域都发展。你不能只发展一个而排除其他。你必须发展它们全部。</p>
<p>These areas represent the arenas in which Knowledge is experienced, expressed and contributed—in relationship, in health, in work and in spiritual development. If you look about you, you will see that there are very few individuals (perhaps you will even have trouble finding or thinking of one) who are developed in all four areas. When we say developed, we do not mean that they are magnificent in all four areas. We mean that they have built the necessary foundation. Their relationships are healthy, focused and purposeful. Their health is adequate for them to carry out their purpose in life. Their work serves this purpose and expresses it. And their spiritual development enables them to participate in life. We are talking of a great balance here. Think of the Four Pillars of life as the four legs of a great table. If those legs are not all strong and well attached, the table will be unstable and you will not be able to place anything of value upon it.</p>
<p>这些领域代表了内识被体验、表达和贡献的领域——关系、健康、工作和精神发展。如果你环顾四周，你会发现很少有人（也许你甚至很难找到或想到一个）在这四个领域都得到了发展。当我们说发展时，我们并不是说他们在这四个领域都表现得非常出色。我们的意思是他们已经建立了必要的基础。他们的关系是健康的、专注的和有目的的。他们的健康状况足以让他们实现他们的生命目的。他们的工作服务于这个目的并表达了它。他们的精神发展使他们能够参与生命。我们在这里谈论的是一种伟大的平衡。把生命的四大支柱想象成一张大桌子的四条腿。如果这些腿不是都坚固且连接牢固，桌子就会不稳定，你就无法在上面放置任何有价值的东西。</p>
<p>When we speak of developing a foundation in life, we are talking about the Four Pillars of your life. We are not talking about wonderful and fanciful spiritual journeys and metaphysical involvements and highly speculative ideas or concepts. We are talking about the cornerstones of your life. They are all interrelated, and they are all important. As you look about the world, you will see that perhaps some people have very good relationships, but their health has been neglected, and they have never developed any kind of financial substance. So they are always trying to patch up the dam, so to speak. Or perhaps others make a great deal of money and have established a great career, but they have no genuine relationships, and they have never been engaged in their spiritual development.</p>
<p>当我们谈到发展生命的基础时，我们谈论的是生命的四大支柱。我们谈论的不是奇妙而虚幻的精神之旅、形而上学的涉猎以及高度臆测的想法或概念。我们谈论的是你生命的基石。它们都是相互关联的，都是重要的。当你环顾世界时，你会看到，也许有些人拥有非常好的人际关系，但他们的健康却被忽视了，他们从未发展出任何形式的经济实质。因此，他们总是想方设法修补堤坝。或者也有其他人赚了很多钱，建立了一种很好的事业，但他们没有真正的关系，他们从未从事过精神发展。</p>
<p>If you look about, you will see that some people have made great accomplishments in one, and more rarely two, of the pillars of life. But they have done so at the expense of the other pillars. Their approach was not a balanced approach. You will see that some have given their lives to relationships, but their health has plagued them, or their financial difficulties have set them back, or they have never found meaningful work in the world. You will see these imbalances everywhere.</p>
<p>如果你环顾四周，你会看到有些人在生命的一个支柱上取得了巨大的成就，很少在两个支柱上。但他们这样做是以牺牲其他支柱为代价的。他们的做法并不平衡。你会看到有些人把一生都奉献给了人际关系，但他们的健康状况却困扰着他们，或者他们的经济困难阻碍了他们，或者他们从未在世界上找到有意义的工作。你到处都能看到这种不平衡。</p>
<p>The Four Pillars are all essential. You must work in every area, and your goals must be realistic and consistent with your life and with the reality of the world at this time. If you work in all areas, all areas will work. If you neglect one of the Four Pillars, it will undermine your success in the other areas where you have focused yourself.</p>
<p>四大支柱都至关重要。你必须在每个领域努力，你的目标必须切合实际，与你的生命和当今世界的现实相一致。如果你在所有领域努力，所有领域都会成功。如果你忽视了四大支柱之一，它将破坏你在你所关注的其他领域的成功。</p>
<p>For many people, this requires forbearance because they have a great deal of desire or ambition, and they want their lives to represent their own desire for accomplishment. They want to be radiantly healthy or fabulously wealthy. Or they want to have relationships that they can show off with pride. Or perhaps they want to become gurus and saints and be able to do spiritual feats that will impress others. All of these motivations are simply a desire for self-importance. They are not governed by Knowledge. They are not motivated by Knowledge. See them for what they are.</p>
<p>对于许多人来说，这需要忍耐，因为他们有着巨大的欲望或野心，他们希望他们的生命代表他们自身对成就的渴望。他们希望身体健康或非常富有。或者他们希望拥有可以自豪炫耀的关系。或者他们可能想成为大师和圣人，能够做出令他人印象深刻的精神壮举。所有这些动机都只是对自我重要性的渴望。它们不受内识的主导。它们不受内识的激励。看清它们的真面目。</p>
<p>What is really needed here is a balanced approach. You want to establish a foundation that can sustain and support your life and provide an opportunity for Knowledge to emerge within you. You are seeking stability here more than the chance to show off. You are seeking an ability to become engaged in life rather than seeking to distinguish yourself within it.</p>
<p>这里真正需要的是一种平衡的方法。你想建立一个能够维持和支持你的生命并为内识在你内在呈现提供机会的基础。你在这里寻求的是稳定而非炫耀的机会。你寻求的是参与生命的能力而非寻求在其中脱颖而出。</p>
<p>A balanced approach will temper your desires and will also enable you to overcome your fears, for nearly everyone is afraid of at least one of the pillars. Some people are afraid of all the pillars. Your desires and your fears will become tempered if you take this approach. This develops character and capacity. If you are driven by ambition or if you are overcome by fear, you will not be able to establish the foundation for a life of Knowledge.</p>
<p>平衡的方法会缓和你的欲望，也会让你克服恐惧，因为几乎每个人都害怕至少一个支柱。有些人害怕所有的支柱。如果你采取这种方法，你的欲望和恐惧就会得到缓和。这培养了品格和能力。如果你被野心驱使，或者如果你被恐惧所征服，你就无法为内识的生命奠定基础。</p>
<p>The great Teachers who oversee human development, whom we call the Unseen Ones, watch over you patiently and with great care and determination. Their first and primary concern is that you build a foundation for Knowledge. You may want Knowledge. You may want truth. You may want peace. You may want reality and meaning. But there must be the foundation. The concern of the Unseen Ones is the foundation, while people’s concern is often simply what will be built on the foundation. The Unseen Ones want you to start at the beginning, but people want to be at the end. The Unseen Ones know what the foundation for learning and for living The Way of Knowledge really means, while people have their great fears and grandiose ideas.</p>
<p>那些监督人类发展的伟大老师，我们称他们为不可见者，他们耐心地、非常细心和坚定地照看着你们。他们首要关心的是你为内识打下基础。你可能想要内识。你可能想要真理。你可能想要和平。你可能想要现实和意义。但必须有基础。不可见者关心的是基础，而人们关心的往往只是在基础上要建立什么。不可见者希望你从头开始，但人们希望站在终点。不可见者知道学习和生活在内识之路上的基础真正意味着什么，而人们有他们巨大的恐惧和宏伟的想法。</p>
<p>You learn to build the foundation by building the foundation. There is no other way. There is no philosophy of building a foundation. There is no hypothesis of building a foundation. There is only building the foundation. You learn the way by following the way. You learn the activity by doing the activity. You learn the steps to Knowledge by taking the steps to Knowledge. You gain Wisdom by exercising Wisdom. There is nothing more and nothing less than following the way, and that is why the way seems so refreshingly simple, honest and open. It is without adornment. It is without embellishment.</p>
<p>你通过建立基础来学习建立基础。没有别的方式。没有一种建立基础的哲学。没有一种建立基础的假说。只有建立基础。你通过遵循道路来学习道路。你通过活动来学习活动。你通过开展内识的进阶来学习内识的进阶。你通过运用智慧来获得智慧。遵循道路，没有更多，也没有更少，这就是为什么道路看起来如此清新简单、诚实和开放。它没有装饰。它没有修饰。</p>
<p>You will be foundation building for a long time. Be content. This is the essential activity. What will be built upon your foundation will be built by you and the Unseen Ones and your Spiritual Family, who have sent you into the world. But you must build the foundation here. Foundation building is absolutely essential, and you will feel essential doing it. And if you have patience and allow the foundation to grow and to build, then your life will become a marvel to you, for you will not be building it alone. You will find that others are there to help you, and their help will be genuine. And you will find that there will be mysterious presences in your life which will help you, and their help will be genuine as well.</p>
<p>你将长期处于建立基础的状态。知足常乐。这是最基本的活动。在你的基础上建立的东西将由你、不可见者和你的精神家庭来建立，是他们把你送到了这个世界。但你必须在这里建立基础。建立基础是绝对必要的，你也会觉得这样做是至关重要的。如果你有耐心，让基础成长和建立，那么你的生命对你来说就会成为一个奇迹，因为你并不是一个人在建设它。你会发现其他人在那里帮助你，他们的帮助是真诚的。你会发现你的生命中会有神秘的存在来帮助你，他们的帮助也是真诚的。</p>
<p>What is genuine in relationship seems so lacking here, and yet as you build your foundation, what is genuine becomes evident—not momentarily, here and there, but increasingly on a daily basis. Foundation building has another great reward. This reward is much greater than you may realize at first. Building a foundation for a greater purpose in life completes the first stage of your life. Whatever has happened to you in the past, whatever disappointments you have had to face, whatever errors you have made, whatever calamities you have either created or endured are simply used now for foundation building. Everything is used for a meaningful purpose and a great endeavor.</p>
<p>关系中的真诚似乎在这里如此缺乏，然而随着你构建你的基础，真诚变得显而易见——不是暂时的、零零星星的，而是日益日常的。基础的构建还有另一个伟大的回报。这个回报比你最初意识到的要伟大得多。为生命中更伟大的目的构建基础完成了你生命的第一阶段。无论你过去发生了什么，无论你不得不面对什么失望，无论你犯了什么错误，无论你制造或忍受了​​什么灾难，现在都只是用来构建基础。一切都被用于一个有意义的目的和一个伟大的事业。</p>
<p>The Way of Knowledge does not ask you to cast away any aspect of yourself or of your life but to bring it into meaningful engagement. In this way, nothing is destroyed and everything is re-employed. Instead of bemoaning your losses or condemning yourself for your errors, you use what you have learned to help others and to gain character, depth and capacity.</p>
<p>内识之路并不要求你抛弃你自己或生命的任何方面，而是要求你将其投入有意义的活动中。这样，一切都不会被破坏，一切都会被重新使用。你不必为你的损失而悲叹，也不必为你自己的过错而自责，而是使用你学到的事情来帮助他人，获得品格、深度和能力。</p>
<p>We can assure you that the great men and women in the world of today and in the past made a great many errors. That is what gave them character and capacity. It is what they did with their errors that made the difference. Their errors were not good for them because they were not divinely intended. Instead, their errors were used for a divine purpose and became useful as a result. In this way, you do not need to justify your experiences but only use them. It is how you use them that will determine whether they will have any value. And if they cannot be used in a useful or positive way, then they will simply remain as a mark against you in your own estimation.</p>
<p>我们可以向你保证，当今和过去的世界伟人都犯过许多错误。正是这些错误赋予了他们品格和能力。正是他们对待错误的方式产生了差异。他们的错误对他们没有好处，因为这些错误并非出于神圣的旨意。相反，他们的错误被用于神圣的目的，并因此变得有用。这样，你就不需要证明你的经历是正当的，而只需使用它们。你如何使用它们将决定它们是否有价值。如果它们不能以有用或积极的方式被使用，那么它们只会成为你自身评价中的一个污点。</p>
<p>Foundation building gives you a new life, but it uses everything that you have built before as material for building this foundation. It makes everything useful and beneficial if it can be brought into meaningful contribution here. This is part of the Plan of the Creator. Nothing is destroyed. Everything is re-employed. Whatever you have made without Knowledge is now brought to serve Knowledge. Whatever you have done to hurt yourself or others is now brought to develop Wisdom, compassion and discernment.</p>
<p>基础的构建赋予你新的生命，但它会使用你之前建设的一切作为建立这个基础的材料。如果能在这里做出有意义的贡献，它会让一切变得有用和有益。这是造物主计划的一部分。没有什么会被摧毁。一切都会被重新使用。无论你在没有内识的情况下做了什么，现在都被用来服务内识。无论你做过什么伤害你自己或他人的事，现在都会被用来发展智慧、同情心和辨别力。</p>
<p>This is what forgiveness means, in reality. Without this, forgiveness is either the decision to be dishonest about your experience, to hide your experience or to try to forget your experience. Real forgiveness is a process of transforming something old into something new, something that was useless into something that is useful, something that is meaningless into something that is meaningful. Here your mistakes, instead of being a source of pain and inner discomfort for you, become a means of reaching other people, for everyone has made mistakes, and many people have made the same ones that you have. This becomes a way to reach people. “I made this mistake. This is what I learned. And this is what I am doing with it now.” What a beautiful teaching this is. How gracious this is and how important it is for the listener and for the communicator as well.</p>
<p>这就是宽恕的真正含义。没有这一点，宽恕要么决定对你的经历不诚实，要么隐藏你的经历，要么试图忘记你的经历。真实的宽恕是一个化旧为新、化无用为有用、化无意义为有意义的过程。在这里，你的错误不再是你痛苦和内心不适的根源，而是成为一种接触他人的方式，因为每个人都犯过错误，许多人都犯过和你一样的错误。这成为一种接触他人的方式。“我犯了这个错误。这就是我学到的。这就是我现在正在做的事情。”这是一个多么美丽的教诲。这对倾听者和沟通者来说是多么亲切，多么重要。</p>
<p>Building this foundation gives you a new way of using your past rather than simply being hounded or hindered by it. It uses your past to serve the present and the future. Without this foundation building, the past simply overshadows the present and makes the future incomprehensible. People who live in the past cannot experience the present and cannot understand the future. And every new experience they have is simply used to fit into the past, to add to their collection of ideas, beliefs and assumptions, and to fortify them as well. Their lives become relics as a result, museum pieces of their own personal history. There is nothing alive, nothing fresh and nothing vital there. Instead, people only amass recollections. Their pain is entrenched, and their decisions have become hard like concrete.</p>
<p>建立这个基础将为你提供一种使用过去的新方法，而不是简单地被过去所困扰或阻碍。它使用你的过去来服务现在和未来。没有这个基础，过去只会遮蔽现在，使未来变得不可理解。生活在过去的人无法体验现在，也无法理解未来。他们所拥有的每一次新体验都只是用来融入过去，增加他们的想法、信念和假设，并强化它们。结果，他们的生命变成了遗迹，成为他们个人历史的博物馆藏品。那里没有任何生机、新鲜和活力。相反，人们只会积累回忆。他们的痛苦根深蒂固，他们的决定也变得像混凝土一样坚硬。</p>
<p>The thinking mind must constantly be stirred by new experience and by adaptation to new experience and new understanding in order to be vital and capable of learning. It is like stirring concrete. If you do not keep stirring it and adding water and new things to it, it hardens. And once it hardens, it can only be broken.</p>
<p>思维的心灵必须不断受到新体验的刺激，并适应新的体验和新的理解，才能保持活力和学习能力。它就像搅拌混凝土。如果你不继续搅拌，不往里面加水和新的材料，它就会变硬。一旦变硬，它就只能被打破。</p>
<p>People who are learning and living The Way of Knowledge are constantly being renewed and refreshed because they are close to life, and they are close to Knowledge. Their thoughts change, grow and evolve. Their ideas change, grow and evolve. Their conclusions change, grow and evolve. They can do this because there is something greater. There is Knowledge, the dynamic force of life within you, within the world and within the Greater Community as well. Knowledge brings you to the edge of life where you have to learn and adapt, communicate and contribute. This keeps you young, alive and close to the heart of life. Your mind, then, becomes constantly relevant to the present and is able to prepare for the future.</p>
<p>学习和生活在内识之路上的人们不断得到更新和振奋，因为他们贴近生命，他们贴近内识。他们的思想在改变、成长和进化。他们的想法在改变、成长和进化。他们的结论在改变、成长和进化。他们能够做到这一点，是因为存在着更伟大的内识。在你的体内，在这个世界上，在这个大社区中，都存在着内识——生命的动力。内识把你带到生命的边缘，在那里你必须学习和适应、交流和贡献。这让你保持年轻、活力并贴近生命的核心。你的心灵因此变得不断与当下相关，并能够为未来进行准备。</p>
<p>To conclude the first stage of your life, you must be engaged in the second and final stage of your life. The first stage of your life is the development of the person. The second stage in life is the development of a greater purpose and the expression of that purpose. To finally make peace with your past, you must be building a new life. To finally be able to understand your past and to use it positively and constructively, you must be building a new foundation. To find freedom from the fears and anxieties that haunt you, you must have a new engagement in life.</p>
<p>要结束生命的第一阶段，你就必须参与生命的第二阶段，也是生命的最后阶段。生命的第一阶段是个人的发展。生命的第二阶段是发展更伟大的目的并表达这个目的。要最终与过去和解，你就必须建立新的生命。为了最终能够理解你的过去，并积极和建设性地使用它，你必须建立一个新的基础。要摆脱困扰你的恐惧和焦虑，你必须重新投入新的生命。</p>
<p>It is to serve this redemption, this freedom and this great opportunity that we now present to you Living The Way of Knowledge. Let us begin now to explore each of the Four Pillars, to see what living and learning The Way of Knowledge is really like in the reality of the world and in the truth of Knowledge.</p>
<p>我们现在向你介绍的生活在内识之路就是为了实现这种救赎、这种自由和这种伟大的机会。现在让我们开始探索四大支柱中的每一个，看看在现实世界和内识的真理中，活在内识之路并学习内识之路究竟是什么样的。</p>
