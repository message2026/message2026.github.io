<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 13, 1994 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1994 年 10 月 13 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will divide our conversation regarding work into three categories. The first is your work in the world. The second is your greater work. And the third is the handling and contribution of money.</p>
<p>我们将关于工作的讨论分为三类。第一类是你在世界上的工作。第二类是你更伟大的工作。第三类是金钱的处理和贡献。</p>
<p>Let us start with your work in the world. To build a foundation for learning and living The Way of Knowledge, it is necessary that you be able to provide for yourself in order to meet your basic needs and expenses and that you deal with these resources—money, time and effort—effectively. If this is neglected, you will be disabled in your attempt to build your foundation and to begin your journey into the next great stage of your life, which is the reclamation of Knowledge and the discovery of a greater purpose.</p>
<p>让我们从你在世界上的工作开始。要为学习和生活在内识之路上奠定基础，你必须能够养活你自己，满足你的基本需求和开支，并有效地处理这些资源——金钱、时间和能量。如果忽视了这一点，你将无法建立你的基础，无法开始你生命下一个伟大阶段的旅程，即重新获得内识和发现更伟大的目的。</p>
<p>There is a great deal of resistance to work and a great deal of resentment and misunderstanding about work. Therefore, let us start from the beginning. It is fundamental for you to understand that you have come to the world to work. This is not the world where you go to have a holiday. This is not the world where you go to take a great vacation or to have an immense amount of rest. You have come from a place of rest, but the world is a place of work and action. And you have come here to work and to take action.</p>
<p>人们对工作有许多抵制，对工作有许多怨恨和错误理解。因此，让我们从头开始。你必须理解，你来到这个世界是为了工作。这不是你去度假的世界。这不是你去度假或休息的世界。你来自一个休息的地方，但这个世界是一个工作和行动的地方。你来到这里是为了工作和采取行动。</p>
<p>Do not confuse the reality of your Ancient Home with the reality of this world. They are different realities, and they call upon different responses within you. You have come here to work. You have work to do. You have to build a foundation for Knowledge. Then upon this foundation a greater work can be given to you. But first the foundation must be built. The bridge between your Ancient Home and this world must be constructed. You have to do your part.</p>
<p>不要混淆你古老家园的现实和这个世界的现实。它们是不同的现实，它们呼唤你内在的不同回应。你来到这里是为了工作。你有工作要做。你必须为内识建立一个基础。然后在这个基础上，一项更伟大的工作才能被赋予你。但首先必须建立这个基础。你的古老家园和这个世界之间的桥梁必须被建立。你必须尽自己的一份力量。</p>
<p>Therefore, your ability to work and your relationship with work are very important. It is necessary that you accept the fact that there will be a great deal of work for you to do. Indeed, when you consider what it will require of you to build and maintain the Four Pillars of life, you might say to yourself, “Oh, my gosh! This is so much work!” Of course it is a lot of work, but it is good work, and it is the work that you came to do. It will make you feel purposeful and useful doing it. Though it is mundane and not glorious or self-glorifying, it will confirm your nature and your greater purpose for being here.</p>
<p>因此，你的工作能力和你与工作的关系非常重要。你有必要接受这个事实：你将有大量工作要做。事实上，当你考虑到建立和维护生命的四大支柱需要你做什么时，你可能会对你自己说：“哦，天哪！这工作量太大了！”当然，这工作量很大，但这是好工作，这是你来这里要做的工作。做这件事会让你感到有目的性和有用性。尽管它很平凡，并不光荣或自我荣耀，但它将确认你的自然和你在这里的更伟大目的。</p>
<p>You have to do the foundation work. Everyone has to do this. No one is simply given a great mission without this foundation. If you think about it, you will realize how important this is, for without the desire and the capacity for Knowledge and for a life of Knowledge, a great mission cannot be carried out. You will not have the ability. You will not have the depth of understanding. You will not have the necessary perspective and approach, and you will certainly not be able to manage the greater powers and the greater skills that will emerge within you and that will be called for in a greater life of Knowledge. You will not be able to preserve your integrity or your ability in a world which seeks to use and to manipulate people who show greater skills and abilities.</p>
<p>你必须做好基础工作。每个人都必须这样做。没有这个基础，没有人会轻易被赋予一个伟大使命。如果你思考一下，你将意识到这有多么重要，因为没有对内识和内识生命的渴望和能力，一个伟大使命就无法实现。你将没有能力。你将没有理解的深度。你将没有必要的视野和方法，你当然会无法管理将出现在你内在的、将在一个更伟大的内识生命中被要求的更伟大的力量和更伟大的技能。你将无法在一个寻求利用和操纵展现出更伟大技能和能力的人的世界上保持你的完整性或你的能力。</p>
<p>Therefore, be content to build your foundation and to give yourself to the great work at hand in doing this. You will find that most of your time will be involved in work, and it will be important work. Perhaps you cannot see where it is taking you. Perhaps you cannot see what will be built upon this foundation, and in most cases you will not see these things until much later. However, Knowledge within you will confirm your activity. Knowledge will be with you in your endeavor, and it will not protest against it unless you are making an error in judgment or in action.</p>
<p>因此，要满足于建立你的基础，并在建立基础的过程中全身心地投入到手头的伟大工作中去。你会发现，你的大部分时间都将用于工作，而这将是重要的工作。也许你看不到它会把你带向何方。也许你看不到在这个基础上将会建立起什么，在大多数情况下，你要到很久以后才能看到这些事情。然而，你内在的内识将确认你的活动。内识将在你的努力中与你同在，除非你在判断或行动上犯了错误，否则它不会提出抗议。</p>
<p>Give yourself to work. Redeem and renew your relationship with work. To build this foundation, you will have to go out and work in the world and perhaps do the kinds of work that seem unrelated to your ideas regarding your greater purpose and nature. Perhaps this work will seem very ordinary and mundane, very repetitive, very unexciting and uninspiring. But it is all right because you are building your foundation. And the foundation is great and important.</p>
<p>把你自己投入到工作中。挽救并更新你与工作的关系。为了建立这个基础，你必须走出去，在这个世界上工作，也许做的是与你的更伟大目的和自然似乎无关的工作。也许这份工作看起来非常普通和平凡，非常重复，非常平淡无奇，毫无新意。但没关系，因为你在建立你的基础。这个基础是伟大而重要的。</p>
<p>The ability to work, the desire to work, the ability to maintain work and to apply yourself in work, while preserving part of your life, attention and energy for greater endeavors and studies, represents a mature and successful approach in building this Pillar of your foundation.</p>
<p>工作的能力、工作的渴望、维持工作的能力以及全身心投入工作的能力，同时保留一部分生命、注意力和能量用于更伟大的事业和学业，代表着建立这个基础支柱的成熟和成功的方法。</p>
<p>Go work in the world. Do not seek a glorious position. Do not ask or demand that the absolute perfect job be given to you because, remember, you are just building the foundation. If you can accept this approach and the humility that it requires, you will be able to advance and create the capacity for experiencing and receiving the greater work, which will come slowly to you, as your foundation becomes strong enough to support it and to sustain it effectively.</p>
<p>到世界上去工作。不要追求光鲜的职位。不要请求或要求给你一份绝对完美的工作，因为，记住，你只是在打基础。如果你能接受这种方法以及它所需要的谦逊，你就能不断进步，创造出体验和接受更伟大工作的能力，随着你的基础变得足够强大，能够支撑它并有效地维持它时，更伟大的工作会慢慢地来到你面前。</p>
<p>When you work, do good work. Give yourself to it. Even if those around you who share your employment do not have this incentive, let your work exercise your abilities, even if these abilities are not valued. If you choose to become a student of Steps to Knowledge, you will be able to apply Steps to Knowledge in all aspects of your life, and you will be encouraged to do so all along the way. Your employment is a perfect environment to teach you discernment, discretion, insight, compassion, ability and restraint. Use this, then, as part of your laboratory for study. Do not demand that your work environment reflect the greater values that you yourself are learning to experience, for in most cases, your work environment will not be able to reflect or demonstrate a greater truth. However, you can demonstrate a greater truth by being there, not by proclaiming yourself or your ideas, but through your own demonstration.</p>
<p>当你工作时，做好工作。全身心投入其中。即使你周围与你共享工作的人没有这种动力，也要让你的工作锻炼你的能力，即使这些能力并不被重视。如果你选择成为内识进阶的学生，你将能够在你生命的各个方面应用内识进阶，你会在整个过程中受到鼓励这样做。你的工作是一个完美的环境，可以教会你辨别力、判断力、洞察力、同情心、能力和克制力。那么，把它作为你学习实验室的一部分吧。不要要求你的工作环境反映你自己正在学习体验的更伟大的价值，因为在大多数情况下，你的工作环境将无法反映或展示更伟大的真理。然而，你可以通过在那里展示更伟大的真理，不是通过宣扬你自己或你的想法，而是通过你自身的示范。</p>
<p>Here the building of your Pillars of Health and Relationship will sustain you, support you and enable you to utilize your work experience beneficially. As you give yourself to your work in the world, remember, it is only a foundation. It is only providing skills and financial sustenance and stability to your life. When you see it as part of the support that you have for building a foundation, your demands of your work situation will not be so great, and you will be in a position to understand its opportunities. Take this approach and practice it.</p>
<p>在这里，健康和关系支柱的建立将支撑你、支持你，并使你能够有益地善用你的工作经验。当你把你自己交给世界上的工作时，请记住，这只是一个基础。它只是为你的生命提供技能、经济支持和稳定。当你把它看作是你建立基础的支持的一部分时，你对工作环境的要求就不会那么高了，你将能够理解它的机会。采取这种方法并加以实践。</p>
<p>If you were not building a greater foundation in life, if you had nothing to work for or towards, then your work situation could become very defining and limiting for you. This would indeed be a serious problem, but you are working towards something greater. You are working to become someone greater. You are working to serve a greater purpose in life, and you are building your foundation for this. Only those who can patiently build the foundation without demanding glory or total satisfaction for themselves will be in a position to receive the grace of Knowledge and its great work and endeavors.</p>
<p>如果你没有在生命中建立一个更伟大的基础，如果你没有为之努力或为之奋斗的事情，那么你的工作状况可能会变得对你非常具有决定性和限制性。这确实是一个严重的问题，但你正在为更伟大的事情而努力。你正在努力成为一个更伟大的人。你正在努力服务于生命中更伟大的目的，你正在为此构建你的基础。只有那些能够耐心地构建基础而不要求他们自己获得荣耀或完全满足的人，才能够接收内识的恩典以及它的伟大工作和事业。</p>
<p>Remember, as you build your foundation, you are also building character and capacity within yourself. You are developing patience and tolerance. You are developing discernment and discretion. You are learning to understand people’s direction and capabilities without maligning or condemning them. You are learning to observe rather than to judge. You are learning to look for opportunities to reach people, rather than demanding that opportunities be ever present. You are learning to utilize the gift of Knowledge in your decision making. And you are learning how to be in the world. All of these represent your preparation and are fundamental to your future success.</p>
<p>记住，当你建立你的基础时，你也在建立你自己的品格和能力。你正在培养耐心和宽容。你正在培养辨别力和谨慎。你正在学习理解人们的方向和能力，而不会诽谤或谴责他们。你正在学习观察而不是评判。你正在学习寻找接触人们的机会，而不是要求机会永远存在。你正在学习在决策中善用内识的礼物。你正在学习如何在世界上生存。所有这些都代表着你的准备，是你未来成功的基础。</p>
<p>Therefore, be content in the realization that you are building for the future. You are building a foundation for Knowledge. The skills that you are developing in your work will have later application there. And the character and capacity you are building will have later application as well. Here you must exercise the great faith that Knowledge is actually taking you somewhere even though you cannot see where that is. You must have great faith that what you are doing today will have value in the future even though you cannot yet fully determine what that will be. You must have great faith that your foundation is real and meaningful and will have a greater service to perform in the world in the future.</p>
<p>因此，要对你正在为未来构建的认识感到满足。你正在为内识建立一个基础。你在工作中培养的技能将在以后在那里得到应用。你正在建立的品格和能力也将在以后得到应用。在这里你必须运用伟大的信仰，相信内识确实在带你去某个地方，即使你看不到那是哪里。你必须坚信你今天所做的事情将在未来具有价值，即使你还不能完全确定那将是什么。你必须坚信你的基础是真实而有意义的，并将在未来为世界发挥更伟大的服务。</p>
<p>Knowledge is silent most of the time. It is watching and waiting. It gives its instruction and direction when necessary and when you are able to receive it. Become patient and observant like Knowledge and you will experience Knowledge’s presence in your life every day.</p>
<p>内识大部分时间都是沉默的。它观察并等待。当需要时，当你能够接受时，它会给出指示和指引。像内识一样变得有耐心和善于观察，你将在日常生活中感受到内识的存在。</p>
<p>Learn to act when action is necessary and learn to communicate with others when they are able to respond, and your behavior will become more like Knowledge. You will then be able to resonate with Knowledge, and Knowledge will be able to resonate within you. Here you bridge the gap between your mind and Knowledge. And here you create a platform in life for Knowledge to express itself through you and with you.</p>
<p>学会在需要行动时行动，学会在他人能够回应时与他们交流，你的行为将变得更像内识。你将能够与内识产生共鸣，内识也将能够在你内在产生共鸣。在这里你架起了你心灵和内识之间的桥梁。在这里你创造了生命中的平台，让内识通过你、与你一起表达它自己。</p>
<p>Accept the reality that you must work. Do not seek to avoid or to escape work, or you will lose your opportunity to develop your skills and your greater abilities. Do not seek the easiest job or the job that requires the least amount of effort, or you will simply be wasting that part of your life where work can be exercised and its benefits can be realized.</p>
<p>接受你必须工作的现实。不要试图逃避工作，否则你将失去发展技能和更伟大能力的机会。不要寻找最轻松的工作或需要最少努力的工作，否则你只是在浪费生命中可以锻炼和实现工作利益的那部分时间。</p>
<p>Seek work that is meaningful, but remember that you are building a foundation. The work you are doing today may not be the work you will be doing in the future. Make sure that your work supplies your basic needs. Otherwise, it will not be fulfilling its function of enabling you and supporting you to build a foundation for Knowledge. Your criteria for work should be very simple and very basic.</p>
<p>寻找有意义的工作，但要记住你正在建立基础。你今天所做的工作可能不是你将来要做的工作。确保你的工作满足你的基本需求。否则，它将无法履行其功能，即让你和支持你为内识建立基础。你的工作标准应该非常简单、非常基础。</p>
<p>Now, let us speak about the greater work. The skills that you have developed in the past and skills that you are developing now have future application. In this, you must place your trust and confidence. The greater work is dependent upon your development and the development of others who are destined to be engaged with you. Your success or failure will determine the outcome, not only for yourself but for them as well. This is a collective effort. It cannot be fulfilled by one person alone.</p>
<p>现在，让我们谈谈更伟大的工作。你过去发展的技能和你现在正在发展的技能都有未来的应用。在这里，你必须寄予信任和信心。更伟大的工作依赖于你的发展以及注定与你合作的其他人的发展。你的成功或失败将决定结果，不仅对你自己，而且对他们也是如此。这是一个集体的努力。它无法由一个人独自完成。</p>
<p>But take heart because every step you take in The Way of Knowledge you strengthen the ability of those key individuals to take that step with you because your minds are already joined. If you fall away or if you give up, they will be inclined to fall away or give up too. This is why at certain times when you seem to lose heart in your greater purpose and you cannot understand why you feel the way you do, perhaps they are losing heart at that moment and you are feeling the effects of their decision and their difficulty.</p>
<p>但请振作起来，因为你在内识之路上迈出的每一步，都增强了那些关键人物与你一起迈出这一步的能力，因为你们的心灵已经结合在一起了。如果你退缩或放弃，他们也会倾向于退缩或放弃。这就是为什么在某些时候，当你似乎对你的更伟大的目的失去信心，你无法理解为什么你会有这样的感觉时，也许他们那一刻也失去了信心，而你正在感受到他们的决定和困难的影响。</p>
<p>As you learn to see that you are part of life rather than separate from life, you will be able to see this dynamic in yourself and in others as well. And you will have a greater appreciation of your responsibilities because it is not only your welfare for which you are responsible but the welfare of your Spiritual Family, and specifically those individuals who have come into the world with you. If they are able to build a foundation for Knowledge and respond to the deeper and greater inclinations within themselves, they will find their way to you and you will find your way to them. Failure is possible here, however. So take this matter seriously. Take your own development seriously. If you do not build an adequate foundation, you will not be able to accept the presence of these individuals in your life or assume the greater duties and the greater work that your relationship with them, once realized, will initiate.</p>
<p>当你学会看到你是生命的一部分而非与生命分离时，你将能够在你自己和他人身上看到这种动力。你将更加欣赏你的责任，因为你不仅要为你的福祉负责，还要为你的精神家庭的福祉负责，特别是那些和你一起来到这个世界的个体。如果他们能够为内识建立一个基础并回应他们内在更深层次、更伟大的倾向，他们就能找到通往你的道路，你也能找到通往他们的道路。然而，失败是可能的。所以认真对待这件事。认真对待你自己的发展。如果你没有建立一个足够的基础，你将无法接受这些个体在你生命中的存在，也无法承担你与他们的关系一旦实现将引发的更伟大的责任和更伟大的工作。</p>
<p>You are here to be a part of the world’s emergence into the Greater Community. You are also here to be a part of the advancement of the human race, which is necessary for your world to emerge successfully into the Greater Community. Your role will not be grandiose. You will not be a saint, a god or a goddess. Your tasks will likely be very mundane. Yet they will serve a greater need, and they will be imbued with a greater purpose and a greater Wisdom. You will realize that if you are here to serve, then you will want to give yourself where your skills, your abilities, your nature and your design can be most effectively employed and applied. This will give you the greatest satisfaction and the greatest confirmation as well.</p>
<p>你来到这里是为了成为世界向大社区迈进的一部分。你来到这里也是为了成为人类进步的一部分，而这对于你们的世界成功向大社区迈进是必要的。你的角色不会宏伟。你不会是一个圣人、一个男神或一个女神。你的任务可能非常平凡。然而它们将服务于一个更伟大的需求，它们将充满着更伟大的目的和更伟大的智慧。你将意识到，如果你来到这里是为了服务，那么你将希望把你自己交给能够最有效地运用和应用你的技能、你的能力、你的自然和你的设计的地方。这将给你最大的满足和最大的确认。</p>
<p>However, if you look at your current state of mind, you will see that it will take awhile to gain the openness and the willingness to have your life be directed. It will require great trust in your Creator and in your Spiritual Family. It will require a great bonding with Knowledge within you. It will require an understanding that anything you try to do alone and without Knowledge will only lead to confusion and failure.</p>
<p>然而，如果你审视你当前的心灵状态，你会看到，你需要一段时间才能获得开放性和意愿，让你的生命得到指引。这需要对你的造物主和你的精神家庭有伟大的信任。这需要与你内在的内识建立伟大的联结。它将需要一种理解，你试图独自、在没有内识的情况下做的任何事情都只会导致困惑和失败。</p>
<p>This great understanding takes time to develop. Simply having a belief in it is not enough. Simply holding great ideas or great ideals does not enable you to actually walk the way and travel the road ahead. That is why your foundation building is so essential, and that is why it must be your focus now. There is greater work ahead for you, but you must prepare, and you must build a foundation—within yourself and within your life in the world.</p>
<p>这种伟大的理解需要时间来发展。仅仅相信它是不够的。仅仅拥有伟大的想法或伟大的理想并不能让你真正走上这条道路，走上前方的道路。这就是为什么你的基础建设如此重要，这就是为什么它现在必须是你的焦点。你面前还有更伟大的工作，但你必须做好准备，你必须建立一个基础——在你自己的内在和你在这个世界上的生命中。</p>
<p>Greater work requires greater resources, greater courage and a greater willingness on the part of its participants. Do not think that you are ready today to do what tomorrow will ask of you. Do not assume that you have learned enough or that you are strong enough or that you have the adequate relationships to carry on a great calling in life. You have a calling in life, and you are responding to it. That is why you are reading this book. And that is why you must focus now on building the foundation and accepting what this requires of you.</p>
<p>更伟大的工作需要参与者拥有更伟大的资源、更伟大的勇气和一种更伟大的意愿。不要认为你今天就准备好去做明天要求你做的事情。不要认为你已经学到了足够多的事情，或者你足够强大，或者你拥有足够的关系来承担生命中的伟大召唤。你有一个生命的召唤，你正在回应它。这就是你阅读这本书的原因。这就是为什么你现在必须专注于建立基础并接受它对你的要求。</p>
<p>To respond to a calling and to actually be able to take on the calling itself are two different things. They represent two different stages in your overall development. You are responding, but that does not mean that you are fully capable. The Creator’s Plan is not only to give you greater work in the world, which was given to you before you even came here. The Plan calls for your preparation and the preparation of those who will be essential in your future endeavors. The preparation takes a lot longer than the greater activity at which it is aimed. Consider examples in the world. How long does it take to prepare a great musician or a great athlete or a great statesman? How long does it take to prepare a person to do something important in the world which entails a great deal of responsibility?</p>
<p>响应召唤和真正能够承担召唤本身是两码事。它们代表着你整体发展的两个不同阶段。你在响应，但这并不意味着你完全有能力。造物主的计划不仅仅是给你在这个世界上更伟大的工作，它在你来到这里之前就已经给了你。该计划要求你做好准备，并准备那些对你未来的事业至关重要的人。准备工作比它所针对的更伟大的活动要花费更长的时间。考虑一下世界上的例子。培养一位伟大的音乐家、伟大的运动员或伟大的政治家需要多长时间？培养一个人在世界上做一些需要承担重大责任的重要事情需要多长时间？</p>
<p>Indeed, a life of Knowledge will require even more than these examples, for it requires not only training your mental and physical abilities, but the expansion of your inner capacity. Here the body must serve the mind, and the mind must serve the Spirit. And it can take a very long time to bring things into the right order. Here you must have a foundation of experience in order to give real substance to your faith and to your determination. Here you must find people who can support you and assist you in this great matter, people who are themselves building a foundation.</p>
<p>事实上，一种内识的生命需要的甚至比这些例子还要多，因为它不仅需要训练你的心理和生理能力，还需要拓展你的内在能力。在这里，身体必须服务于心灵，心灵必须服务于精神。并且可能需要很长时间才能让事情恢复正常秩序。在这里，你必须拥有经验的基础，才能为你的信仰和决心赋予真正的实质。在这里，你必须找到能够在这件大事上支持你、协助你的人，那些他们自己也在建立基础的人。</p>
<p>This seems to take a long time because people are very unwilling to relinquish what they have, even if what they have troubles them or disorients them. The emphasis in the world is on acquisition, and so you want more and more and more. And if you are unhappy with what you have today, well, you want something new and different. You want more. But having more is not the answer. If what you have is not meeting your need, then having more will only compound your confusion and dilemma.</p>
<p>这似乎需要很长时间，因为人们非常不愿意放弃他们所拥有的东西，即使他们所拥有的东西让他们感到困扰或沮丧。这个世界强调的是获取，所以你想要更多。如果你对现在所拥有的一切不满意，那么你就会想要一些新的、与众不同的东西。你想要更多。但拥有更多并不是答案。如果你所拥有的东西不能满足你的需求，那么拥有更多只会加剧你的困惑和困境。</p>
<p>It can take a very long time to come to terms with this within yourself. We wish to shorten this time as much as possible because you are needed in the world. You have come to serve the world at a very great turning point, perhaps the greatest turning point that any race can face. You have come for this. So do not take forever to come to terms with your deeper inclinations. We call for a greater honesty within you, an honesty that responds to Knowledge and is not governed or controlled by your will or your ambitions. Then the time it takes to come to terms with what you really know and what is really genuine in your life can be effectively shortened, which saves you time, energy and a great deal of suffering.</p>
<p>你可能需要很长时间才能从内心接受这一点。我们希望尽可能缩短这段时间，因为这个世界需要你。你是在一个伟大的转折点来为世界服务的，也许是任何种族都可能面临的最伟大的转折点。你为此而来。因此，不要花太长时间去接受你内在更深层次的倾向。我们呼唤你内在拥有一种更伟大的诚实，这种诚实是对内识的回应，而不是被你的意志或野心所支配或控制。这样，接受你真正知道的内识、接受你生命中真正真实的内识所需的时间就能被有效缩短，从而为你节省时间、能量和大量的痛苦。</p>
<p>When you are ready for your real work, it will begin to emerge, and it will emerge in stages. You must be successful in each stage to go on to the next. You cannot leap from where you are into a new life, with a new understanding and a new set of abilities. It has taken you many, many years to get to where you are today. Now you can move faster and more quickly, but it will still take years. But if you are successful and self-determined, and if you are honest with yourself, then you will make great strides. Indeed, you will find that you will be learning as fast as you can. You will be taken to the limit of your ability to learn and to integrate new experiences and new ideas.</p>
<p>当你准备好开始真正的工作时，它就会开始显现，而且会分阶段显现。你必须在每个阶段都取得成功，才能进入下一个阶段。你不可能从现在的位置一跃而上，带着新的理解和新的能力进入新的生命。你花了很多年的时间才达到今天的水平。现在你可以行动得更快、更迅速，但这仍然需要数年时间。但如果你成功、有主见，并且对你自己诚实，那么你就会取得巨大进步。事实上，你会发现你会以最快的速度学习。你的学习能力和整合新经验和新想法的能力将被发挥到极致。</p>
<p>Perhaps you are beginning to feel this now at certain points in your life. Your life is being accelerated, but the real preparation still takes time. You are learning to gain a new position with yourself in the world, and you are learning to find the real order of authority within yourself. You are turning away from the world’s teaching to learn something mysterious and wonderful. This cannot be done in a day, a month or a year. However, your life can and will become accelerated as you approach this wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>也许你现在在生命的某些时刻开始感受到这一点。你的生命正在加速，但真正的准备工作仍需要时间。你正在学习如何在这个世界上获得你自己的新位置，你正在学习如何找到你自己内心真正的权威秩序。你正在远离世界的教导，去学习一些神秘而美妙的事情。这不可能在一天、一个月或一年内完成。然而，当你全心全意地去做这件事时，你的生命可以而且将会变得更快。</p>
<p>Your greater work will involve the expression of Knowledge because Knowledge will be its source and its guide. It will involve relationships where dedication and honesty are a living reality for you and for others who are engaged with you. It will involve an understanding and a sense of determination that is greater than anything that you have experienced thus far. You are preparing for this, within yourself and in your life. Through your work, you are building skills and abilities in dealing with people.</p>
<p>你更伟大的工作将涉及内识的表达，因为内识是工作的源泉和指南。它将涉及到关系，在这种关系中，奉献和诚实对你和与你交往的其他人来说都是活生生的现实。它将涉及一种理解和一种决心，这种理解和决心比你迄今为止所经历的任何事情都要伟大。你正在为此做准备，在你自己的内心和在你的生命中。通过你的工作，你正在建立与人交往的技能和能力。</p>
<p>Your work in the world is not meant to be fully satisfying because it is not yet your greater work. Perhaps it is leading you in that direction. If it were totally fulfilling, you would not advance. You would become satisfied before you had reached your real goal. Your work in the world may be challenging, frustrating, demanding, and on occasion confirming to you. But it is not the real work for which you are preparing. Accept these limitations. In the future, you will realize how important they are in terms of building character and capacity and preventing you from assigning success to your life prematurely.</p>
<p>你在世上的工作并不一定会让你完全满意，因为它还不是你的更伟大的工作。也许它正引导你走向这个方向。如果它完全令人满意，你就不会进步。你会在达到你的真正目标之前就感到满足。你在世上的工作可能具有挑战性、令人沮丧、要求很高，有时也会证实你。但它不是你正在准备的真正工作。接受这些限制。在未来，你会意识到它们在塑造品格和能力以及防止你过早地将成功赋予你的生命方面有多么重要。</p>
<p>Your dissatisfaction with your life is part of what drives you forward, for you must reach the great vantage point where you can see clearly what you must do. And you must find those people who will enable you to reach this vantage point and who will be able to participate with you beyond it. You are being driven by a deeper, inner necessity. Accept this. It is fundamental. It is necessary. It is vital. It will keep you from compromising your life. It will keep you from being deceitful with yourself by claiming that you have reached a satisfactory place, or that you have found your purpose, meaning and direction, when in fact you have not found them yet. It will keep you from giving your life in a relationship prematurely or in dedicating all of your resources and energy to a career or a form of work which does not represent your destiny.</p>
<p>你对生命的不满是推动你前行的一部分，因为你必须达到伟大的观测位置，在那里你能够清晰地看到你必须做什么。你必须找到那些将使你达到这个观测位置并能够与你一起参与超越这个观测位置的人。你被一种更深层次、内在的需求所驱动。接受这一点。它是根本的。它是必要的。它是至关重要的。它将阻止你损害你的生命。它将阻止你欺骗你自己，声称你已经到达一个令人满意的地方，或者你找到了你的目的、意义和方向，而事实上你还没有找到它们。它将阻止你过早地把你的生命交给一段关系，或者把你所有的资源和能量交给一个并不代表你天命的事业或工作形式。</p>
<p>Accept this dissatisfaction. It will drive you onward. It will give you courage. It will give you determination. It will overcome your tendencies and your complacency, and it will offset all of the factors within you and around you in your environment that seek to weaken you and to compromise your approach.</p>
<p>接受这种不满。它将推动你前进。它将给你勇气。它将给你决心。它将克服你的倾向和自满，它将抵消你内在和周围环境中所有试图削弱你、损害你的方法的因素。</p>
<p>You know, it is very interesting that people try to get rid of this discomfort inside themselves. They want to get rid of it. They want to be at peace today. And they think that their inner discomfort is somehow a psychological problem or a problem in their upbringing or a defect in their nature. And so they try to overcome it or eradicate it or cover it over with other things so that they can be happy and fulfilled today.</p>
<p>你知道，人们试图摆脱内心的不适，这很有趣。他们想摆脱它。他们想今天过得和平。他们认为内心的不适在某种程度上是一种心理问题、成长问题或自然缺陷。所以他们试图克服它、根除它或用其他事物掩盖它，这样他们今天就能快乐和满足。</p>
<p>You will not be happy and fulfilled today. You will only be happy if you are advancing and if you can experience this. And you will only be happy if your thinking and your approach are in keeping with Knowledge.</p>
<p>你今天不会感到快乐和满足。只有当你在进步并且能够体验到这一点时，你才会快乐。只有当你的思维和你的方法与内识相一致时，你才会快乐。</p>
<p>Today is meaningful for today, but you are going somewhere. You have a destiny. You have a rendezvous with important people. You have a realization to gain. You have strength to build. You have weaknesses to overcome. This requires work. This requires dedication. This requires that you have a sense of direction, that you go somewhere. You are not simply stopped by the side of the road to take a nap for the rest of your life. You will find many wonderful places to visit along the way, many wonderful people to meet along the way, but you must keep going.</p>
<p>今天对于今天来说意义重大，但你要去某个地方。你有一个天命。你要与重要的人会面。你要有所领悟。你要建立力量。你要克服弱点。这需要努力。这需要奉献。这需要你有方向感，你要去某个地方。你不会只是停在路边小憩一辈子。沿途你会发现许多美妙的地方可以去，许多奇妙的人可以遇见，但你必须继续前行。</p>
<p>If you take the steps to Knowledge, you will reach your true destiny and your true destination. If you stop for any reason, for love or for money, for comfort or for pleasure, then you will not reach your destination, and you will not experience your destiny. And no amount of therapy or consolation will offset the discomfort that you will feel within yourself. For what greater failure could there be than the failure to fulfill what you came to the world to fulfill? Look about in the world and you will see how unhappy people are. Many of them are very unhappy because they have already failed. They have already given away too much of their life, their energy and their resources, and they live with a dissatisfaction that no amount of comfort or pleasure can offset. They are angry. They are frustrated. And their anger gets projected upon situations which have no real relationship to it.</p>
<p>如果你开展内识的进阶，你将抵达你真正的天命和真正的目的地。如果你因为任何原因而停下来，无论是为了爱还是为了金钱，为了舒适还是为了快乐，那么你将无法抵达你的目的地，你将无法体验你的天命。无论多少治疗或安慰都无法抵消你自己内心感受到的不适。因为还有什么比没有实现你来到这个世界上要实现的目的更大的失败呢？环顾这个世界，你会看到人们有多么不快乐。他们中的许多人非常不快乐，因为他们已经失败了。他们已经付出了太多的生命、精力和资源，他们生活在一种不满之中，无论多少舒适或快乐都无法抵消这种不满。他们是愤怒的。他们是沮丧的。他们的愤怒被投射到与之没有实际关系的环境中。</p>
<p>Accept inner dissatisfaction. Accept the drive to move forward. It is not a personal ambition now, though you have experienced personal ambitions before. It is a deeper sense that you have a place to get to and you cannot be late. You have to keep traveling because you have not found it yet. And even if you have found it, and even when you do find it, you will have to move forward with it. Remember, the world is a place to work. It is not a place to sleep. The world is a place to get things done. It is a place of action. The world is a place of doing. Where you have come from, your Ancient Home, is a place of being where there is no need to take action. However, in the world, you have to take action, and you have to be with that action. Here you find your complete experience. Here you must be in action. It doesn’t mean that you are busy every moment of the day, but it means that your day is about solving problems and getting things done. This gives you satisfaction here.</p>
<p>接受内心的不满。接受前进的动力。现在这不是个人野心，尽管你以前有过个人野心。这是一种更深层次的感觉，你有一个地方要去，你不能迟到。你必须继续旅行，因为你还没有找到它。即使你找到了它，即使你真的找到了，你也必须带着它前进。记住，世界是一个工作的地方。它不是一个睡觉的地方。世界是一个完成事情的地方。它是一个行动的地方。世界是一个做事的地方。你的来处，你的古老家园，是一个不需要采取行动的地方。然而，在这个世界里，你必须采取行动，你必须与行动同在。在这里，你会发现你完整的体验。在这里，你必须行动。这并不意味着你每时每刻都很忙，而是意味着你的一天就是解决问题和完成事情。这让你在这里感到满足。</p>
<p>Remember, this is a different reality from your Ancient Home. Do not try to make this like your Ancient Home or you will miss your opportunity here completely. The world is its own reality. Work with it. Work within it. For you have come here to contribute to it. If you do not accept it, if you deny it, how can you contribute to it? If you avoid it or seek escape from it, how can you find its great opportunity, the opportunity to experience and to express Knowledge here?</p>
<p>记住，这是一个不同于你古老家园的现实。不要试图把它当成你的古老家园，否则你将完全错过你在此的机会。世界是它自身的现实。与它共事。在它之内共事。因为你来到这里，就是要为世界做出贡献。如果你不接受世界，如果你否认它，你怎么能为它做出贡献？如果你回避它或寻求逃离它，你怎么能找到它的伟大机会，在这里体验和表达内识的机会？</p>
<p>If you avoid the road ahead and seek comfort or retreat, you will be dissatisfied. Perhaps you argue with me. Perhaps you disagree with these words. But you must face yourself—not your personal mind, but Knowledge. Knowledge will not condemn you, but it will not compromise either. Knowledge will not send you to hell because Knowledge can only prepare you for Heaven. Do not try to make a deal with Knowledge because it will not bargain. It knows its purpose. It knows its destiny. It knows the important junctures along the way which you must reach, and it will take you to them relentlessly. It is complete. It is wholehearted. It is determined. It is pervasive. Unlike your personal mind. It holds all of these qualities because it is the source of these qualities, and you will gain these qualities as you work with Knowledge, as you approach Knowledge, and as you accept its direction. In uniting with Knowledge, you become more like Knowledge. And eventually, you become a demonstration of Knowledge itself.</p>
<p>如果你避开前方的道路，寻求舒适或退缩，你就会感到不满。也许你会和我争论。也许你不同意这些话。但你必须面对你自己——不是你的个人心灵，而是内识。内识不会谴责你，但也不会妥协。内识不会把你送入地狱，因为内识只能让你为天堂做好准备。不要试图与内识做交易，因为它不会讨价还价。内识知道它的目的。内识知道它的天命。内识知道你必须到达的沿途的重要关口，它会坚持不懈地带你到达那里。它是完整的。它是全心全意的。它是坚定的。它是无处不在的。不像你的个人心灵。它拥有所有这些品质，因为它是这些品质的源泉，当你与内识合作，当你接近内识，当你接受它的指引时，你将获得这些品质。在与内识结合时，你会变得更像内识。最终，你就会成为内识本身的展示。</p>
<p>You must keep going. This is work. This is accomplishment. This produces a real satisfaction and sense of value in life, for in the world you will value yourself according to your activity. If your activity is meaningless, you will feel meaningless. If your activity has no purpose or value, you will feel that you have no purpose or value. This is a place of action. Satisfaction is found through action here.</p>
<p>你必须坚持下去。这就是工作。这就是成就。这会产生一种真正的满足感和生命的价值感，因为在这个世界上，你会根据你的活动来评价你自己。如果你的活动毫无意义，你就会感到毫无意义。如果你的活动没有目的或价值，你就会感到自己没有目的或价值。这是一个行动的地方。在这里，通过行动可以找到满足感。</p>
<p>This is different from where you have come from. That is why it has taken you a long time to learn to be here because it is so different from where you have come from. Why does it take human beings so many years to develop when they seem to have so much intelligence and ability? Some animals are up and walking about within a day. It takes people years. Whereas the animals are carrying on normal activities within a short period of time, it takes human beings years. It takes a long time for you to become accustomed to living in a physical reality, in a life of action. You have to learn these things. You have to adapt and learn. And it takes time because in a sense it is unnatural to you. You are a spiritual being and action is foreign to a spiritual being. It must be learned.</p>
<p>这与你来自的地方不同。这就是为什么你花了很长时间才学会适应这里，因为这里与你来自的地方完全不同。人类似乎拥有如此多的智慧和能力，为什么却要花这么多年的时间才能发展？有些动物一天之内就能站起来走动。而人类则需要数年时间。动物在短时间内就能进行正常活动，而人类则需要数年时间。你需要很长时间才能习惯生活在物质现实中，习惯于行动的生命。你必须学习这些事情。你必须适应和学习。这需要时间，因为从某种意义上说，这对你来说是不自然的。你是一个精神存在，而行动对精神存在来说是陌生的。它必须被学习。</p>
<p>However, you have come here for this purpose, and you have come this far. You do not want all that you have experienced and endured to be wasted. It has brought you this far. Therefore, you must keep going and do the work that is necessary to support you so that you can keep going. You have invested yourself tremendously already. You have paid the price of admission into the world. You have paid the price of upbringing in the world. Now you must seek the reward. Now you must seek the result for which you have paid so dearly. Not only have you paid the price of admission, but your Spiritual Family has as well. It is unfortunate at this moment that you cannot realize how much work and effort have been made on your behalf to bring you to this threshold of Knowledge. You cannot see this yet because you are not at the vantage point where this can be seen. You are not far enough up the mountain to see the landscape.</p>
<p>然而，你是为了这个目的而来，你已经走了这么远。你不想让你所经历和忍受的一切白白浪费。它已经把你带到了这么远。因此，你必须继续前进，做必要的工作来支持你，这样你才能继续前进。你已经为你自己付出了极大的投入。你已经付出了进入世界的代价。你已经付出了在世界上成长的代价。现在你必须寻求回报。现在你必须寻求你付出如此高昂代价的结果。不仅你付出了入场费，你的精神家庭也付出了。不幸的是，此刻你无法意识到，为了把你带到内识的这个门槛，他们为你付出了多少工作和努力。你还看不到这一点，因为你还没有站在可以看到这一点的观测位置。你还没有爬得足够高，无法看到整个风景。</p>
<p>Therefore, you are doing this for yourself, for those who sent you and for those who have come into the world with you. You are working for them as well as for yourself. Let this be a source of courage and encouragement for you. Let this add to your determination. Let this prevent you from falling prey to the easy persuasions that take you away, promising rest, comfort, love and pleasure.</p>
<p>因此，你这样做是为了你自己，为了那些派遣你的精神家庭，为了那些和你一起来到这个世界的人。你这样做既是为了你自己，也是为了他们。让这成为你的勇气和鼓励之源。让这增强你的决心。让这阻止你成为那些轻易说服你的人的牺牲品，这些说服会带你离开，承诺休息、舒适、爱和快乐。</p>
<p>As you travel the road of life and the road of Knowledge, you will see many people broken down by the side of the road. You will see many people asleep by the side of the road. You will see many people who have gone off the road in different directions, seeking pleasure or comfort, love or wealth. Keep going. You can’t turn back. You only have two choices: You either keep going or you stop. If you leave the road and wander about in the woods and in the wilderness, you are not going anywhere. You have only stopped. There is a great deal of motion but no movement.</p>
<p>当你走在生命之路和内识之路上时，你会看到许多人在路边倒下。你会看到许多人在路边睡着。你会看到许多人偏离道路走向不同的方向，寻求快乐或舒适、爱情或财富。继续前行。你不能回头。你只有两个选择：要么继续前行，要么停下来。如果你离开道路，在树林和荒野中徘徊，你哪儿也去不了。你只是停下来了。有许多动作，但没有移动。</p>
<p>Your opportunity to learn a Greater Community Way of Knowledge gives you direction and focus, helps you to organize your life and brings you in the direction of your calling. It takes you down the road, even if others cannot go with you, even if others are heading off in different directions, even if others are encouraging you to come with them in their pursuits. Knowledge calls you to come down the road because Knowledge can only go down the road. If you go elsewhere, it will not go with you. And if you go elsewhere, its only message to you is to return.</p>
<p>你学习大社区内识之路的机会为你提供了方向和焦点，帮助你组织你的生命，并带你走向你的召唤。它带你走上这条道路，即使其他人不能和你一起走，即使其他人正朝着不同的方向前进，即使其他人鼓励你和他们一起追寻。内识召唤你走上这条路，因为内识只能走下去。如果你去了别的地方，它就不会和你一起走。如果你去了别的地方，它给你的唯一讯息就是回归。</p>
<p>The possibility for deception in human beings is extremely great. People are very vulnerable to error, and they are very vulnerable to persuasion because they are not yet with Knowledge. Very few people have begun the second great stage of life, and those who have, have found life to be very different from what they thought it was before. They have found a greater strength and a greater ability because they have stayed on the road to Knowledge. They have become consistent and patient, and they see that life is a long process with many stages, and each one must be completed.</p>
<p>人类欺骗的可能性极高。人们非常容易犯错误，他们非常容易被说服，因为他们还没有与内识在一起。只有极少数人开始了生命的第二个伟大阶段，而那些开始的人发现生命与他们之前所想的非常不同。他们发现了一种更伟大的力量和一种更伟大的能力，因为他们一直在通往内识的道路上前行。他们变得始终如一、有耐心，他们看到生命是一个漫长的过程，有许多阶段，每一个阶段都必须完成。</p>
<p>Do your work in the world. Develop as a student of Knowledge. Learn to live The Way of Knowledge by building a foundation for Knowledge. Do not confuse and confound yourself by telling yourself that everything you are doing is appropriate or necessary. You do not know that yet. Do not commit a disservice to yourself by assuming that all of your interests, desires and inclinations are genuine. You do not know this yet. Follow the way that is given and do not change it, for you do not know the way yourself. Perhaps you think that you can create a better journey, but until you take this journey and see where it takes you, you have no basis for making that determination.</p>
<p>在世界上做你的工作。发展为一名内识的学生。通过建立内识的基础，学习生活在内识之路上。不要告诉你自己你所做的一切都是恰当或必要的，这样会让你自己困惑和迷茫。你还不知道这一点。不要自欺欺人地认为你所有的兴趣、渴望和倾向都是真实的。你还不知道这一点。遵循既定的道路，不要改变它，因为你自己也不知道这条道路。或许你认为你可以创造一段更好的旅程，但直到你踏上这段旅程，看到它会带你去哪里，你才有做出这个决定的基础。</p>
<p>Advance with humility. You are given great authority in your life to manage your thinking and your affairs. Such a great responsibility is more than most people can handle at this point. You are given all of the authority that you could possibly need, and perhaps more than you really want. However, there are limits to your authority because you are part of a greater life and a greater purpose. You manage your ship, but you do not know what it is for yet. Every day you keep your ship in order so that it can be ready to sail. You have somewhere to go, but you do not know the way.</p>
<p>谦逊地前进。你被赋予了伟大的权威来管理你的思维和事务。如此伟大的责任超出了大多数人目前所能承担的范围。你被赋予了你可能需要的所有权威，也许比你真正想要的还要多。然而，你的权威是有限的，因为你是更伟大的生命和更伟大目的的一部分。你管理着你的船，但你还不知道它是用来做什么的。每天你都要把船整理好，这样它就可以准备好起航。你有地方要去，但你不知道路在哪里。</p>
<p>Therefore, you follow the steps to Knowledge, for the way is given, and what is needed to be learned is given, and what is unnecessary will in time be recognized and fall away. Your life will become focused and orderly. Your endeavors will be brought into harmony. Then over time your mind will be able to think clearly and gather its resources and its inner strength to focus and to move in one direction. Here you bring everything that is essential within you together into one great pursuit. And you gain a strength and a power that are rarely evident in people.</p>
<p>因此，你遵循内识的进阶，因为道路已经被赋予，需要学习的内识已被赋予，而不必要的事物将随着时间被认知并消失。你的生命将变得专注和有序。你的努力将被带入和谐。然后随着时间的推移，你的心灵将能够清晰地思考，并汇聚它的资源和内在力量来专注并朝着一个方向前进。在这里，你将内心的一切精华汇聚成一个伟大的追求。在这里，你会获得一种力量，一种在人们身上很少显现的力量。</p>
<p>You prepare for your greater work by the work that you are doing today—the work you do as a student, the work you do in your employment, the work you do to support your relationships and to learn from them, the work you do to maintain your health, the work you do in your spiritual development.</p>
<p>你通过今天正在做的工作为你的更伟大工作进行准备——你作为一名学生所做的工作，你在你的工作中所做的工作，你为了支持你的关系并从中学习所做的工作，你为了维护你的健康所做的工作，你在你的精神发展中所做的工作。</p>
<p>The answer to your prayer for purpose, meaning and direction in life is a preparation. What other answer could there be? When you call for help, a ladder is sent down to you. What other help could there be? When you have fallen into a deep pit, will ideas, realizations, or visions help you? What will really help you? What will really help you is that someone sends down a ladder, with steps on it, so that you can climb out. When you are in a deep pit, you cannot see the world; you cannot see your predicament; you cannot see what is beyond your predicament; you cannot see where you need to go. The only reality is you must find a way out.</p>
<p>你为生命目的、意义和方向而祈祷，而得到的答案是一种准备。还能有什么其他答案呢？当你呼救时，会有人把梯子送到你面前。还能有什么其他帮助呢？当你掉进深坑时，想法、领悟或远见会帮助你吗？什么会真正帮助你？真正能帮助你的是有人送下梯子，上面有台阶，这样你就可以爬出来。当你身处深坑时，你看不到世界；你看不到你的困境；你看不到困境之外的事情；你看不到你需要去的地方。唯一的现实是你必须找到一条出路。</p>
<p>Living a life of imagination and having your mind enclosed in its own ideas is like falling into a deep pit, and if you spend enough time in this deep pit, all you see is the deep pit, which is the encumbrance of your own ideas and perspective. When your personal mind is estranged from Knowledge, it substitutes the reality of Knowledge with its own ideas, and it creates a self-enclosed world that is governed by thoughts and impulses, some of which are your own and many of which come from the environment around you. You only see what your thoughts allow you to see, and you only experience what your thoughts allow you to experience, and you can only do what your thoughts allow you to do. You are a prisoner within your own mind, but even your mind is not free because it must serve your body, to which it has given its primary allegiance.</p>
<p>过着一种充满想象力的生命，让你的心灵被它自身的想法所束缚，就像掉进了一个深坑，如果你在这个深坑里呆了足够长的时间，你所看到的就只有这个深坑，这是你自己的想法和观点的累赘。当你的个人心灵疏远内识时，心灵用它自身的想法取代内识的现实，它创造了一个自我封闭的世界，这个世界被思想和冲动所支配，其中一些是你自身的，许多来自你周围的环境。你只能看到你的思想允许你看到的事情，你只能体验你的思想允许你体验的事情，你只能做你的思想允许你做的事情。你是一个你自身心灵的囚徒，但即使是你的心灵也不是自由的，因为它必须服务于你的身体，而它已经对你的身体产生了首要的效忠。</p>
<p>It is like falling into a big hole in the ground, and after awhile all you see is the hole in the ground. You pray for help, you call for help, and you seek to make your life tolerable within the hole in the ground. You ask for peace, you ask for consolation, you ask for opportunity, and you ask for redemption, and what you get is a ladder—a way to climb out. The ladder goes unnoticed and unappreciated because people do not realize that they have fallen into a deep pit. They have become so accustomed to living in such an isolated manner that they do not realize their predicament and what they are missing in life.</p>
<p>它就像掉进地上的一个大洞中，过​​了一会儿，你看到的就只有地上的洞。你祈求帮助，你呼唤帮助，你试图让你的生命在地洞里变得可以忍受。你祈求和平，你祈求安慰，你祈求机会，你祈求救赎，而你得到的只是一架梯子——一种爬出去的方法。梯子之所以不被注意和重视，是因为人们没有意识到他们已经掉进了深坑。他们已经习惯了如此孤立的生活，以至于他们没有意识到他们的困境和他们在生命中所缺失的内识。</p>
<p>The answer to your prayers is a preparation, a way out, a ladder with steps. Your Spiritual Family must get you out of the hole of your own thinking. They must open the doors to your mind and open the windows so you can see out and so the communication can come in. They must bring you out of the prison of your own thoughts and conditioning and back into life as it is. Then the mind reorients itself and becomes reassociated with life. It then re-establishes a genuine hierarchy in its relationship with the Spirit and with the body.</p>
<p>对你祈祷的回答是一种准备，一种出路，一架有台阶的梯子。你的精神家庭必须把你从你自身的思维的深渊中解救出来。他们必须打开你心灵的大门，打开窗户，这样你才能看到外面，才能沟通进来。他们必须把你从你自身的思想和条件的牢笼中解救出来，回到现实生命中。然后，心灵会重新调整它自己，重新与生命联系起来。然后，它在与精神和身体的关系中重新建立了一个真正的等级制度。</p>
<p>This requires work. You must take the steps to Knowledge. You must work in the world to support yourself while you are taking the steps to Knowledge. It seems simple because it is simple, but what is simple is often avoided because it is difficult, because it is challenging. There is no compromising here. There is no making deals with the truth. There is no saying, “Well, I’ll do a little of this and a little of that.” The simple answer is the direct answer. You have to get up and start going down the road of life again. You can’t lie around by the side of the road thinking about it or trying to think of some way where you can hold onto that which is pleasurable and still have a sense of purpose, meaning and direction. No, you have to get up, start moving and get going. You have to climb out of that hole that you have spent many, many years digging for yourself.</p>
<p>这需要工作。你必须开展内识的进阶。你必须在开展内识进阶的同时，在世界上工作以养活你自己。这看起来很简单，因为它很简单，但是简单的事情常常被回避，因为它很困难，因为它很有挑战性。这里没有妥协。没有与真理做交易。这里不能说：“好吧，我做一点这个，做一点那个。”简单的答案是直接的答案。你必须站起来，重新开始走上生命的道路。你不能躺在路边思考它，或者试图想出某种方式，让你能够抓住那些令人愉快的事情，同时仍然有目的感、意义感和方向感。不，你必须站起来，开始行动，开始前进。你必须爬出你花了很多年为你自己挖的洞穴。</p>
<p>You can be visited by angels. You can hear an inner voice. You can have wonderful experiences. But until you get up and start moving, until you climb up that ladder and get out of the hole, nothing has really changed.</p>
<p>天使可以来拜访你。你可以听到一种内心的声音。你可以拥有美妙的经历。但是，直到你站起来开始行动，直到你爬上梯子走出困境，一切都没有实际改变。</p>
<p>The Way of Knowledge moves you to a different position within yourself, to a different position of authority within yourself. It moves you into a different position in life where you can understand and appreciate life and become actively engaged in it.</p>
<p>内识之路将你带入你自己内心的一个不同位置，带入你自己内心的一个不同权威位置。它将你带入生命中的一个不同位置，在那里你可以理解和欣赏生命，并积极地参与其中。</p>
<p>Estrangement from life produces all neurosis. The inability to act produces all frustration. The inability to know produces all deception. Perhaps this seems confusing and incomprehensible, yet in your heart you know that it is true because this is what the heart calls for—being a vehicle for Knowledge. Your mind and your body will in time become vehicles for Knowledge as well, as they become unified with one another. The only way to unify the Spirit, the body and the mind is to bring them into their true relationship. Then you can function harmoniously at all three levels. Here Knowledge can be expressed at all three levels and accomplishment can be made at all three levels.</p>
<p>与生命的疏离会导致一切神经衰弱。无力行动会导致所有的挫折感。无知会导致一切欺骗。也许这看起来令人困惑和难以理解，但你内心知道这是真实的，因为这就是内心的呼唤——成为内识的载体。随着你的心灵和你的身体彼此统一，它们也将及时成为内识的载体。统一精神、身体和心灵的唯一方法是让它们进入真正的关系。然后你就可以在三个层面和谐地运作。在这里，内识可以在三个层面上表达，并且可以在所有三个层面上取得成就。</p>
<p>The Spirit knows. The mind thinks. And the body acts. When they are brought together, greatness begins to be revealed in the world. Your Ancient Home begins to be experienced here. A life has come alive. A mind becomes illuminated. A body is able to express and to communicate a greater and more pervasive reality. This is what you are working towards and for, and this is why your work in the world today is important.</p>
<p>精神知道。心灵思考。身体行动。当它们结合在一起时，伟大开始在世界上显现。你的古老家园开始在这里被体验。生命开始活跃起来。心灵变得光明。身体能够表达和传达一个更伟大、更普遍的现实。这就是你工作的方向和目的，这也是为什么你在当今世界上的工作很重要。</p>
<p>Let us speak now about money. The necessary teaching about money is very simple, but that also means that it is very demanding. The teaching is not here to compromise or to make deals between what you may want and what you may know. They are indeed different. You must choose one or the other. You cannot have them both. In the future, when you want what you know, you will feel a great harmony within yourself. However, until this happens, you have to make fundamental decisions and you have to face the consequences. It is only through making these decisions that you are able to get up and move, for walking the way of life and The Way of Knowledge involves a series of important decisions and activities.</p>
<p>现在让我们来谈谈金钱。关于金钱的必要教导非常简单，但这也意味着它非常苛刻。这里的教导不是在你可能想要的和你可能知道的之间妥协或做交易。它们确实是不同的。你必须选择其中一个。你不能同时拥有它们。在未来，当你想要你所知道的东西时，你会感觉到内心的极大和谐。然而，在这种情况发生之前，你必须做出根本性的决定，你必须面对后果。只有通过做出这些决定，你才能站起来并前进，因为走上生命之路和内识之路涉及一系列重要的决定和活动。</p>
<p>How do you handle money? Let us give you some ideas. Money is a resource. What does it serve and support? If it serves and supports building a foundation for learning and living The Way of Knowledge, it becomes useful and meaningful, for like everything in the physical universe, everything is valued according to what it serves and what it does. If money serves a useless purpose, it is useless. If it serves a useful purpose, it is useful. If you serve a useless purpose, you will feel useless. If you serve a useful purpose, you will feel useful. In the world, you are what you do. In the world, money is what it does. Its value is only derived from the purpose that it serves.</p>
<p>你如何处理金钱？让我们给你一些想法。金钱是一种资源。它服务和支持什么？如果它服务和支持建立学习和生活在内识之路的基础，它就会变得有用和有意义，因为就像物质宇宙中的一切一样，一切的价值都取决于它所服务的内容和它所做的事情。如果金钱服务于无用的目的，它就是无用的。如果它服务于有用的目的，它就是有用的。如果你服务于无用的目的，你就会感到你是无用的。如果你服务于有用的目的，你就会感到你是有用的。在这个世界上，你就是你所做的。在这个世界上，金钱就是它所做的。它的价值仅仅源于它所服务的目的。</p>
<p>Live simply. Only own that which you need and perhaps a few little things for your personal enjoyment. Fundamentally, own only what you truly need and there will be no confusion, and you will not have to work too hard for money. Give money to support those things that inspire you. They require support, and you need to support them to experience your relationship with them.</p>
<p>简单生活。只拥有你需要的东西，也许还有几件小东西供你个人享受。从根本上讲，只拥有你真正需要的东西，就不会有困惑，你也不必为钱而努力工作。用钱来支持那些能激励你的事情。他们需要支持，你需要支持他们，才能体验到你与他们的关系。</p>
<p>If you have a lot of money, become a benefactor. Give money to worthy people and worthy endeavors. The only value for having wealth is to be able to give it away. After all, how much do you really need in the world? If your future greater work requires that you have access to money, it is only as a resource so that you can give it away and do meaningful things with it. If your greater work in the future does not require that you have much money, then you do not need it, do you? Having less than you need is a problem, but having more than you need is a problem as well. If you have less than you need, you must find ways to earn it, but you do not need a great deal. Therefore, having less than you need is not nearly as great a problem as having more than you need.</p>
<p>如果你有很多钱，就做一个慈善家。把钱给值得的人和值得的事业。拥有财富的唯一价值就是能够把它赠予他人。毕竟，你在这个世界上真正需要多少钱？如果你未来的更伟大工作需要你获得金钱，那么它只是一种资源，这样你就可以把它赠予他人，并用它做一些有意义的事情。如果你未来的更伟大工作不需要你有很多钱，那么你就不需要它了，对吗？拥有比你所需要的更少的东西是一个问题，但拥有比你所需要的更多的东西也是一个问题。如果你拥有的比你所需要的更少，你必须想办法去赚取它，但你不需要很多钱。因此，拥有比你所需要的更少的东西远不如拥有比你所需要的更多的东西那么严重。</p>
<p>Remember, money is here to serve. You do not want to serve it. Money is a resource to be employed. It is here to serve. You do not want to become its servant. What does money serve for you? How do you use money? Do you preserve money and save it for future use? Do you live according to what you need or are you dominated by what you want? Perhaps you are working too hard in your work in the world because you are requiring more money than you really need. Perhaps you have to work harder in the world because you need more than you have. You must find what is correct for you. However, to be able to find what is correct, you must know what is correct, and you must have the necessary criteria.</p>
<p>记住，金钱是用来服务的。你不想为它服务。金钱是一种资源，用来服务。你不想成为它的仆人。金钱为你服务什么？你如何使用金钱？你是否保留金钱并存起来以备将来使用？你是按照你所需要的生活，还是被你想要的东西所支配？也许你在世上工作太辛苦了，因为你需要的钱比你真正需要的多。也许你必须在世上更加努力地工作，因为你需要的比你拥有的多。你必须找到适合你的事情。然而，要想找到正确的事情，你必须知道什么是正确的，你必须有必要的标准。</p>
<p>Here you must look again to Knowledge, to what is essential within you. You must look to what you know to do today. Our words are to encourage Knowledge within you, not to replace Knowledge within you. Therefore, we call upon Knowledge within you, and we call upon you to come to Knowledge and to ask very fundamental questions: What do I really need to own? How much do I really need to earn? How much money do I need to have available to give away? How much money should I save for the future? Knowledge knows. Can you ask these questions and be ready to take action?</p>
<p>在这里，你必须再次看向内识，看向你内在最本质的内识。你必须看向你知道今天该做什么。我们的话语是为了鼓励你内在的内识，而非取代你内在的内识。因此，我们呼唤你内在的内识，我们呼唤你走向内识并问出非常基本的问题：我真正需要拥有什么？我真正需要赚多少钱？我需要有多少钱可以奉献？我应该为未来存多少钱？内识知道。你能问这些问题并准备好采取行动吗？</p>
<p>Knowledge will not speak to you if you are not ready to take action. You will just hear what you want to hear, and nothing important will have happened. But if you are ready to take action, if you are sincere, if you are capable, if you are open to this, Knowledge will speak to you—in a word, in a feeling, in a message from another person, in an insight, in a thought, in a dream, in a vision. In whatever avenue Knowledge can reach you at this point in your life, it will reach you. Ask the question and wait for the answer. And as you wait, see if you are really willing to know and to act.</p>
<p>如果你不准备采取行动，内识就不会对你说话。你只会听到你想听到的，不会发生任何重要的事情。但如果你准备好采取行动，如果你真诚，如果你有能力，如果你对此持开放态度，内识就会对你说话——通过一句话、一种感觉、来自他人的一条讯息、一种洞察力、一种思想、一个梦、一个愿景。无论内识在你生命的这个时刻以何种方式接触到你，它都会接触到你。提出问题并等待答案。在等待的过程中，看看你是否真的愿意知道并采取行动。</p>
<p>If you come to Knowledge asking questions, but you really do not want to know the answer, or you want to make a deal between what you know and what you want, then you are not being sincere. Ask an honest question and you will get an honest answer. Ask a dishonest question and you will get the answer that you want.</p>
<p>如果你来向内识提问，但你真的不想知道答案，或者你想在你知道的和你想要的之间做交易，那么你就不是诚实的。问一个诚实的问题，你会得到一个诚实的答案。问一个不诚实的问题，你会得到你想要的答案。</p>
<p>Money is a resource. It is like the other objects in your life—your food, your clothing, your possessions, the house you live in, any other tools or resources you may have. Its value is determined by the purpose it serves. How much you need is determined by the requirements of your life.</p>
<p>金钱是一种资源。它就像你生命中的其他物品一样——你的食物、衣服、财产、你住的房子、你可能拥有的任何其他工具或资源。它的价值取决于它的用途。你需要多少取决于你的生命需求。</p>
<p>If you are poor and have insufficient resources financially, then you must find a way to earn more, and you must make yourself available for other people to contribute to you. You do this so that in the future you can contribute to others. Remember, there is no spiritual welfare in reality, and welfare is not a state you want to be in. If you have a great deal of money, it is only to be given for real purposes and to help those who do not have enough. If you wish for money to serve you and to be the servant it is meant to be, you must have this approach.</p>
<p>如果你很穷，没有足够的经济来源，那么你必须想办法赚更多的钱，你必须让你自己可以为他人做贡献。你这样做是为了将来能为他人做贡献。记住，现实中没有精神福利，福利也不是你想要的状态。如果你有很多钱，那也只是为了实际的目的，为了帮助那些没有足够钱的人。如果你希望金钱为你服务，成为它本该成为的仆人，你就必须采取这种方法。</p>
<p>Money is a resource for getting things done. That is its only value. And if what it accomplishes is real and meaningful, and if it is well placed and given to the right people who are capable of using it effectively and responsibly, then it has served a good purpose, and you will feel good about it and about yourself. If at this moment you do not feel good about money, if you have conflicts regarding it, then ask yourself the fundamental questions that we have mentioned thus far.</p>
<p>金钱是完成事情的资源。这是它唯一的价值。如果它所完成的事情是真实的、有意义的，如果它被妥善安排并给予了能够有效、负责任地使用它的正确的人，那么它就达到了一个很好的目的，你就会对它和你自己感觉良好。如果此时此刻你对金钱感觉不好，如果你在金钱问题上有冲突，那么请扪心自问我们迄今为止提到的基本问题。</p>
<p>You have a relationship with money. You have a relationship with everything. What kind of relationship is it? What does it serve? What can you accomplish together? These are important questions for you now. Your answer is a ladder. Climb it. It is a gift from the Creator. Follow its steps. What you are being offered is a way out and a way up, not merely a consolation or a comfort. You ask for too little. You seek too little. Ask for more, for more is given.</p>
<p>你与金钱有关系。你与一切都有关系。这是一种什么样的关系？它的作用是什么？你们能共同完成什么？这些都是你现在面临的重要问题。你的答案就是一架梯子。爬上去吧。它是造物主的礼物。跟随它的阶梯。给你提供的是一条出路和上升之路，而不仅仅是一种安慰或慰藉。你要求的太少。你寻求的太少。要求更多，因为给予的更多。</p>
