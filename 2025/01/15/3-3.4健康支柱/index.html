<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 12, 1994 in Boulder, Colorado<br>1994 年 10 月 12 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a great deal of conversation in the world about how to regain, enhance and maintain health. But let us look at a more fundamental question before we deal with these questions. That question is, What is health? What constitutes genuine health within a person? Is health merely the absence of illness or symptoms of illness? Is health merely the absence of disability or physical limitations? Or, taken from a different approach, is health the ability to do athletic events or to meet some basic criteria of physical ability?</p>
<p>世界上有许多关于如何恢复、增强和保持健康的讨论。但在回答这些问题之前，让我们先看看一个更基本的问题。这个问题是，什么是健康？什么构成了一个人真正的健康？健康仅仅是没有疾病或疾病症状吗？健康仅仅是没有残疾或身​​体限制吗？或者，从另一个角度来看，健康是否就是能够参加体育比赛或达到某些基本的体能标准？</p>
<p>Within the context of building a foundation for learning and living The Way of Knowledge, let us say fundamentally that health is vitality. It is the vitality born of living a genuine life—a life that is full of meaning and purpose, a life that has direction and a life that is meaningfully engaged with others and with the world. This produces a vitality, a will to live and a desire to contribute—a certain zest for life, you might say.</p>
<p>在为学习和践行内识之路奠定基础的背景下，我们可以从根本上说，健康就是活力。它是活出真实生命而产生的活力——一种充满意义和目的的生命，一种有方向的生命，一种与他人和世界进行有意义交往的生命。这就产生了一种活力、一种生活的意愿和一种作出贡献的欲望——可以说是一种对生命的热情。</p>
<p>It is remarkable that this vitality is lacking in so many people who meet other criteria for health, even in people who meet a very high level of fitness and in people who have never experienced serious illness. And it is equally remarkable that vitality can be found in certain individuals who have physical handicaps or who have had a history of physical illness.</p>
<p>令人惊讶的是，许多符合其他健康标准的人都缺乏这种活力，甚至那些身体素质很高的人和从未患过严重疾病的人也是如此。同样令人惊讶的是，某些身体有缺陷或有身体疾病史的人却充满活力。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must look at the very center of things. What is health and what produces health? From this, you can understand what threatens health and gain a much clearer idea of how your health can be maintained.</p>
<p>因此，你必须看清事物的核心。什么是健康？什么产生健康？由此，你就能理解什么在威胁健康，并更清楚地知道如何保持健康。</p>
<p>Health is vitality. Vitality is a will to live and to contribute. It contains an excitement about life. It contains a sense of purpose in life. And it communicates its natural affinity with life to everyone around you. This vitality can be in a body that is strong or in a body that is weak, though if your body functions properly, you will have a greater opportunity to experience this vitality. Even those with serious physical limitations or even handicaps can experience this fundamental essence of health.</p>
<p>健康就是活力。活力是一种生存和贡献的意志。它包含着对生命的兴奋。它包含着对生命的目的感。它向你周围的每个人传达着它与生命的自然亲和力。这种活力可以存在于强健的身体中，也可以存在于虚弱的身体中，但如果你的身体功能正常，你将有更大的机会体验到这种活力。即使是那些身体有严重缺陷甚至残疾的人也可以体验到健康的这种基本本质。</p>
<p>The next question that arises at the outset is, How much health is necessary? In the world you will find a great diversity of opinion, a whole range of responses. Someone will say, “Well, health is simply not being sick!” Others will say, “Oh, no, health is being much more active, much more vibrant, much more able.”</p>
<p>第一个问题是，健康需要到什么程度？世界上有各种各样的观点，各种各样的反应。有人会说：“嗯，健康就是不生病！”其他人会说：“哦，不，健康是更加活跃、更加有活力、更加有能力。”</p>
<p>There is a great preoccupation with health, even amongst healthy people, because the expectations are very high. People hope for or expect a physical life without aches and pains and problems. There are even points of view that state that if the body is injured or sick, something must be wrong with the person fundamentally, as if everyone must experience perfect health at all times, and if they do not experience this, something is inherently wrong in their thinking. While it is true that negative imagination and inappropriate engagements with others will rob you of your vitality, which lowers and lessens your possibility for health, it should not be assumed that sickness and injury represent a deficiency in nature. Illness and injury are part of the risk of living in the physical world. They can happen to anyone.</p>
<p>即使是健康的人，也非常关注健康，因为他们的期望很高。人们希望或期待身体上没有疼痛和问题。甚至有观点认为，如果身体受伤或生病，这个人从根本上肯定出了问题，就好像每个人都必须一直保持完美的健康，如果他们没有这种感觉，那么他们的思维方式就一定有问题。虽然消极的想象和与他人不适当的交往确实会夺走你的活力，从而降低和减少你健康的可能性，但不应认为疾病和伤害代表了自然的缺陷。疾病和伤害是生活在物质世界中的风险的一部分。它们可以发生在任何人身上。</p>
<p>This statement will arouse some disagreement because people are very idealistic about health. They suppose that if a person’s life is in order and is being lived meaningfully, there will be no sickness or injury. This is a hopeful expectation, yet it is not based on truth. Even the wisest of the Wise have a risk of injury. Even the wisest of the Wise grow sick and old. And yet, the possibility for sickness and injury can be greatly reduced, and here you can take some very meaningful steps to assure your physical well-being. However, in order to begin, you must have an idea for yourself of how much health is necessary. Let us address this question now, for it is fundamental.</p>
<p>这种说法会引起一些争议，因为人们对健康非常理想化。他们认为，如果一个人的生命井然有序，过得有意义，就不会生病或受伤。这是一个充满希望的期望，但它不是基于真理。即使是最聪明的人也会有受伤的风险。即使是最聪明的人也会生病和衰老。然而，生病和受伤的可能性可以大大降低，在这里你可以采取一些非常有意义的步骤来确保你的身体健康。然而，为了开始，你必须知道你自己健康需要多少。现在让我们来解决这个问题，因为它是根本问题。</p>
<p>Said in the simplest terms, your body is healthy if it can serve you in being fully engaged in your purpose in life. Now, this statement requires some qualifiers because, you see, you do not yet know what your purpose is in life. But if you have sufficient physical health to be able to build a foundation for Knowledge and to embark on the second great stage of life, then you will have sufficient health.</p>
<p>用最简单的话来说，如果你的身体能够帮助你全身心地投入到你的生命目的中，那么它就是健康的。现在，这句话需要一些限定词，因为你知道，你还不知道你的生命目的是什么。但如果你的身体足够健康，能够为内识奠定基础，并踏上生命的第二个伟大阶段，那么你就有足够的健康。</p>
<p>Here health is not associated with beauty or athletic prowess or any other magnificent ideal. It is sufficient health. Your body is able to serve. This is health. If your body is not able to serve, then in essence you must give up your greater pursuits in life and give your body your primary attention. It is as if the body were a vehicle, like an automobile. If the automobile’s purpose were to get you from one point to another, then it has served its purpose. But if mechanically it cannot do this, then it must go into the shop for repairs.</p>
<p>在这里，健康与美貌、运动能力或其他任何宏伟理想无关。健康就是足够的健康。你的身体能够服务。这就是健康。如果你的身体不能服务，那么从本质上讲，你必须放弃生命中更伟大的追求，把主要注意力放在你的身体上。身体就像是一辆车，就像一辆汽车。如果汽车的目的是把你从一个地方带到另一个地方，那么它就完成了它的任务。但如果它在机械上不能做到这一点，那么它就必须去修理厂修理。</p>
<p>If your physical body is able to carry you through life, then you have sufficient health. We must clarify this at the outset because when we talk about building the Pillar of Health, you must have some very realistic expectations. If you set expectations beyond what is necessary and essential, then you will become obsessed in this one area to the expense of your involvement in other Pillars. As we have said, all of the Four Pillars must be maintained together. Now, it is true that you will need to give more attention to one Pillar for certain periods of time than to another, but they must all be maintained. It is quite evident that people become obsessive about their physical health. Sometimes they have a legitimate cause for this because their body is simply unable to function. But here we must come back to our fundamental definition: The body’s purpose is to serve as a vehicle to enable you to carry out a greater purpose in life.</p>
<p>如果你的身体能够支撑你度过一生，那么你就有足够的健康。我们必须从一开始就澄清这一点，因为当我们谈论建立健康支柱时，你必须有一些非常现实的期望。如果你设定的期望超出了必要和必要的范围，那么你就会沉迷于这一领域，而牺牲了你对其他支柱的参与。正如我们所说，所有四大支柱都必须一起维护。现在，确实你需要在某些时期比另一个支柱更多地关注一个支柱，但它们都必须得到维护。很明显，人们对他们的身体健康过于痴迷。有时他们这样做有正当的理由，因为他们的身体根本无法正常运作。但在这里我们必须回到我们的基本定义：身体的目的是作为一种载体，使你能够实现生命中更伟大的目的。</p>
<p>You will find that many people who are obsessive about their health have sufficient health to carry out their purpose, but they are neglecting their purpose because they have a greater expectation of their health. We must distinguish here between what is desired and what is needed—a very important distinction that has to be applied to every aspect of life. If your body, like the automobile, can take you from one place to another, it is serving its purpose. It does not have to be perfect. And if you try to make it perfect, well, you will give it more attention than it really deserves, and you will do so at the expense of maintaining the other essential aspects of your life.</p>
<p>你会发现，许多对健康极为痴迷的人，他们的健康足以实现他们的目的，但他们却因为对健康的期望过高而忽视了他们的目的。我们必须在此区分什么是渴望的，什么是需要的——这是一个非常重要的区别，必须应用到生命的方方面面。如果你的身体就像汽车一样，能把你从一个地方带到另一个地方，那么它就发挥了它的作用。它不必完美无缺。如果你试图让它变得完美，那么，你就会给它比它真正应得的更多的关注，而你这样做的代价是牺牲了维持你生命中其他基本方面的利益。</p>
<p>Remember, there are Four Pillars of life, and they all must be maintained. They all must become strong and functional. Here you must have realistic expectations. If you set your sights beyond this, you are drawing yourself away from your other endeavors to dedicate yourself to one area alone. Therefore, when we speak of health, we speak of a level of health that is sufficient and that is necessary. This may be in contrast to what is expected or what is desired.</p>
<p>记住，生命有四大支柱，它们都必须得到维护。它们都必须变得强大和功能齐全。在这里，你必须有现实的期望。如果你把目光放得更远，你就会把你自己从其他努力中抽离出来，只专注于一个领域。因此，当我们谈论健康时，我们谈论的是足够和必要的健康水平。这可能与预期或期望形成对比。</p>
<p>So you have to ask yourself, What is essential health for me? Before you ask this question, consider how much time and energy is spent on your health or on things that you believe are related to your health, such as beauty and grooming and dressing yourself and personal enhancement and so forth. We have said that even the invalid can be radiant with Knowledge. This is vitality.</p>
<p>所以你必须问你自己，什么才是我最需要的健康？在问这个问题之前，先想想你花了多少时间和精力在健康上，或者在你认为与健康有关的事情上，比如美容、打扮、穿衣打扮、个人提升等等。我们说过，即使是病人也能散发出内识的光芒。这就是活力。</p>
<p>Therefore, what is the correct expectation? What is right for you? We can only give you guidelines and warnings and point you in the right direction. If you are to develop the Four Pillars of your life as a foundation for learning and living The Way of Knowledge and for becoming a person of Knowledge, then you will find that you cannot afford to be over invested in any one area. You must seek a balance, which is something that very few people do in this world.</p>
<p>因此，什么是正确的期望？什么对你来说是正确的？我们只能给你指导和警告，并为你指明正确的方向。如果你要发展你生命的四大支柱，作为学习和生活在内识之路上以及成为一个内识之人的基础，那么你会发现你无法承受在任何一个领域过度投入。你必须寻求一种平衡，这是这个世界上很少有人能做到的事情。</p>
<p>The body must be capable of doing what is required of it. What will be required of it will depend upon your purpose as it becomes revealed to you and as you are prepared to experience it and to carry it out. Some may need more from their bodies than others, but we assure you that most of the people in the world today who have sufficient food, shelter and stability in their lives, are capable of becoming men and women of Knowledge based on their current level of health.</p>
<p>身体必须能够做它需要做的事情。它需要做什么将取决于你的目的，因为它会向你揭示，你也准备好去体验它并实现它。有些人可能比其他人需要从身体中获得更多，但我们向你保证，当今世界上大多数拥有充足食物、住所和稳定生活的人，都能够根据他们目前的健康水平成为内识的男女。</p>
<p>Again, we make a distinction between what is adequate and essential and what may be desired or expected. Being able to run over mountains or perform great athletic feats is fine for athletes, but it is not necessary to develop and to maintain an adequate level of health. Indeed, to do these kinds of activities will require an investment that may disable you from building a foundation for Knowledge.</p>
<p>再次，我们区分了什么是充分和必要的，什么是可以渴望或期望的。能够跑过高山或做出伟大的运动壮举对运动员来说很好，但这对于发展和保持足够的健康水平来说并不是必要的。事实上，做这些活动需要投资，这可能会阻碍你为内识打下基础。</p>
<p>There is often not enough given to the body, but in many cases there is too much given in the name of health. People are obsessed with health and healing and feeling good and looking good, but at what expense? Some people will say, “Well, I would love to develop in The Way of Knowledge and learn to live The Way of Knowledge, but I have to take care of my health problem!” And of course, their health problems continue on and on and on. Their problem is not health. Their problem is their priorities. Unless you have a life-threatening illness, you can develop in The Way of Knowledge. Even if you are bound to a wheelchair or are physically disabled in some other way, you can build a foundation for Knowledge.</p>
<p>给予身体的往往不够，但在许多情况下，为了健康的名义给予了太多。人们痴迷于健康和治愈，感觉良好，外表好看，但代价是什么呢？有些人会说：“好吧，我很想在内识之路上发展，学会生活在内识之路上，但我必须照顾好我的健康问题！”当然，他们的健康问题会一直持续下去。他们的问题不是健康。他们的问题是他们的优先事项。除非你患有危及生命的疾病，否则你可以在内识之路上发展。即使你被束缚在轮椅上或身体有其他残疾，你也可以为内识奠定基础。</p>
<p>Here you must assess what adequate health is. You gauge your expectations and your standards according to what is needed. This practical approach to health is so essential. It brings things into a proper perspective and gives you a much more accurate understanding about what must be done to maintain your physical health. Without this fundamental principle and perspective, based on what is actually needed in your life, you will fall prey either to neglect or to obsession, and this will disable you from living a balanced and purposeful life.</p>
<p>在这里你必须评估什么是足够的健康。你根据所需来衡量你的期望和标准。这种对健康的实用方法非常重要。它能让你以正确的视角看待事物，让你更准确地了解必须做些什么才能保持身体健康。如果没有这个基于你生命中实际需要的基本原则和视角，你要么会成为忽视的牺牲品，要么会成为痴迷的牺牲品，这将使你无法过上一种平衡而有目的的生命。</p>
<p>The body is a mechanism. It is not magical. Do not confuse it with the mind or with the Spirit. People attempt to make them all the same because they want to feel that they are unified and that life is unified. But life functions at different levels. It functions at the level of the physical environment, the mental environment and the spiritual environment. Your primary concern in living in the world and in learning to live The Way of Knowledge is to develop adequate skills in the physical and mental environments. You develop skill in the physical environment so that you can live a balanced life. And yet, because of the world’s emergence into the Greater Community, you must also learn skill in the mental environment, adequate skill, in order to be able to function and to carry out that which you know you must do. You do not need skill in the spiritual environment because Knowledge is in you and because you are connected to your Spiritual Family and to the Unseen Ones, who oversee your development.</p>
<p>身体是一种机制。它不是魔法。不要将它与心灵或精神相混淆。人们试图让它们都一样，因为他们想要感觉到它们是统一的，生命是统一的。但生命在不同的层面上运作。它在物理环境、心理环境和精神环境的层面上运作。你在世界上生活以及学习按照内识之路生活时，你的主要关注点是在物理环境和心理环境中发展足够的技能。你在物理环境中发展技能，这样你就能过上平衡的生命。然而，由于世界正在进入大社区，你也必须学习心理环境中的技能，足够的技能，以便能够运作并完成你知道你必须做的事情。你不需要精神环境中的技能，因为内识在你内在，因为你与你的精神家庭和不可见者相连，他们监督着你的发展。</p>
<p>There is no guarantee in life that you will have perfect health. Even if your thinking is perfect and your behavior is immaculate, though your risk may be much reduced for accident, illness or injury, you still have this risk because that is part of being in the world. People often want to eliminate the idea of risk. They do not like the idea that they have to live with risk, and so they believe, “There is really no injury or accident in the world. There is no sickness. It is all the result of human dysfunction, and if human dysfunction could be eliminated, well, there would be no accidents, injuries or illnesses.” Again, look at the world around you. Look at the plants and the animals. They all take a risk in living here. There is no guarantee that everything will go perfectly for them, that they will all live a long span of years. To be in life, you must be in life as it is not as you want it to be. To experience life, you must experience life as it is and not as you want it to be.</p>
<p>在生命中，没有人能保证你拥有完美的健康。即使你的思维完美，行为无瑕，尽管你遭遇意外、疾病或受伤的风险可能会大大降低，但你仍然有这种风险，因为这是身处这个世界的一部分。人们常常想消除风险的想法。他们不喜欢必须与风险共存的想法，所以他们相信，“世界上真的没有伤害或意外。没有疾病。这都是人类功能障碍的结果，如果人类功能障碍能够消除，那么就不会有意外、伤害或疾病。”再看看你周围的世界。看看植物和动物。它们在这里生活都冒着风险。没有人能保证它们一切都会完美无缺，没有人能保证它们都能长命百岁。要融入生命，你就必须融入生命本来的样子，而不是你想要的生命。要体验生命，你就必须体验生命本来的样子，而不是你想要的生命。</p>
<p>There are risks in being in the world. That is part of being here. Accept this. This requires courage not avoidance. If you are going to embrace life, you have to embrace it. You cannot simply take the parts that you like and disdainfully reject the rest. You may have an idea of a perfect life or a set of ideals that illustrate a perfect life, but we are bringing you to something greater—a real life, a genuine life, a life that is fully in harmony with Knowledge within you and Knowledge in the universe. This is the Divine.</p>
<p>身处世界是有风险的。这是身处此地的一部分。接受这一点。这需要勇气而非逃避。如果你要拥抱生命，你就必须拥抱它。你不能简单地选择你喜欢的部分而轻蔑地拒绝其余部分。你或许对完美的生命有一个想法或一套描绘完美生命的理想，但我们正在带你走向一种更伟大的生命——一种真实的生命，一种真诚的生命，一种与你内在内识和宇宙内识完全和谐的生命。这就是神圣。</p>
<p>Again, our approach seems simple in contrast to other approaches because it is without deception. It does not take anything away from what is needed, and it does not add anything on. How much health is needed? You finally must answer this question for yourself, but consider the criteria. Ask yourself, “How much health do I need to carry out the process of building a foundation for learning and living The Way of Knowledge? Can my body, like a vehicle, get me across town? Can it take me where I need to go? Can it communicate to people?” You will find in most cases, with few exceptions, that the answer is yes.</p>
<p>同样，与其他方法相比，我们的方法似乎很简单，因为它没有欺骗。它不会从需要的东西中拿走任何东西，也不会增加任何东西。需要多少健康？这个问题最终必须由你自己来回答，但请考虑一下标准。问问你自己，“我需要多少健康才能完成为学习和生活在内识之路奠定基础的过程？我的身体能像一辆车一样带我穿过城镇吗？它能带我去我需要去的地方吗？它能与人沟通吗？”你会发现在大多数情况下，除了少数例外，答案是肯定的。</p>
<p>Here the body can be treated lovingly and appropriately. Yet if you try to make the body conform to your ideals of health or to your picture of perfect health, you will demand so much from it that you will harm it. You will expect it to be a perfect instrument. You will expect infallibility from it. You will demand that it perform according to a set of ideals that is not in keeping with the nature of physical reality or the nature of your physical vehicle.</p>
<p>在这里，身体可以得到关爱和适当的对待。然而，如果你试图让身体符合你对健康的理想或你对完美健康的想象，那么你对它的要求就会太多，以至于会伤害它。你会期望它成为一个完美的工具。你会期望它绝对正确。你会要求它按照一套不符合物理现实或你的物理载体性质的理想行事。</p>
<p>Come back to this fundamental question. What is necessary for my body to get the work done that I have come to do? This is a question you must ask yourself on an ongoing basis. Once is not enough because your answer will change, particularly as you advance as a student and practitioner of The Way of Knowledge. Perhaps you are displeased with the shape of your body or with aspects of its appearance, as many people are. But does this really make a difference in terms of your body’s ability to serve a greater purpose? And how much are you willing to invest in these superficial enhancements? How much are you willing to give of your primary energy, time and resources to try to overcome minor objections to your body’s appearance and functioning?</p>
<p>回到这个基本问题。我的身体需要什么才能完成我来这里要做的工作？这是一个你必须不断问你自己的问题。一次是不够的，因为你的答案会改变，特别是当你作为内识之路的学生和实践者进步时。也许你和许多人一样，对你的身体形状或外表的某些方面不满意。但这真的能改变你的身体服务于更伟大目的的能力吗？你愿意在这些表面的增强上投入多少？你愿意付出多少主要能量、时间和资源来试图克服对你身体外观和功能的微小反对意见？</p>
<p>Again, we bring you back to the practical approach, to the approach that works, which is based on what you can do in life. For as we have said, meaningful relationships with other people are based on what you can do in life together. What you do together in life develops your bond, your trust and the capabilities and dimensions of your relationship.</p>
<p>再次，我们带你回到实用的方法，回到行之有效的方法，它基于你在生命中可以做什么。正如我们所说，与他人建立有意义的关系是基于你们在生命中能一起做什么。你们在生命中一起做的事情会发展你们的纽带、你们的信任以及你们关系的能力和维度。</p>
<p>The same holds true of your relationship with your body. It is what you can do together that will develop your relationship here as well. Expect too much and you will be disappointed. Find the real basis of your relationship. This is found by discerning over time what you must do. Then the body is employed because it is fundamentally an instrument of communication. The purpose of the body is not to be beautiful. It is to be an instrument of communication, to be a vehicle and to participate in a physical world in a physical reality. Like an automobile, if it can get you where you need to go, it has done its job. And yet, look at the way people treat their automobiles and how much time and energy goes into them! Do people consider the automobile as a vehicle to go from one place to another? Oh, no. The vehicle becomes a canvas for their self-expression. It becomes something that represents some idea that they have about themselves or some image that they want to project, and so a great amount of time and energy, money and resources are put into something that is basically a vehicle of transportation. There is an interesting analogy between this and your relationship with your body.</p>
<p>你与身体的关系也是如此。你们可以一起做的事情也会发展你们的关系。期望过高，你就会失望。找到你们关系的真正基础。这是通过随着时间的推移辨别你必须做什么而找到的。然后身体被使用，因为它从根本上是一种沟通工具。身体的目的不是美丽。它是沟通的工具，是一种载体，参与物质现实中的物理世界。就像汽车一样，如果它能把你送到你需要去的地方，它就完成了它的任务。然而，看看人们对待汽车的方式，看看人们在汽车上投入了多少时间和精力！人们把汽车看作是从一个地方到另一个地方的交通工具吗？哦，不。汽车成为他们自我表达的画布。它成为代表他们对他们自己的想法或他们想要投射的形象的东西，因此大量的时间和精力、金钱和资源被投入到基本上是交通工具的东西上。这和你与身体的关系有一个有趣的类比。</p>
<p>Should you find your real contribution in life, you will be remembered for your contribution, and your life will be appreciated for your contribution. When you leave this world, if your contribution has been made sufficiently, you will remember this life based on your contribution. Nothing else will matter. Just your contribution and the relationships that it stimulated and developed. That is all that you can take with you from this world. Therefore, that is primarily what you need to be concerned with while you are here in the world.</p>
<p>如果你在生命中找到了真正的贡献，人们将因你的贡献而铭记你，你的生命也将因你的贡献而感激你。当你离开这个世界时，如果你的贡献足够多，你将基于你的贡献铭记这一生。其他一切都不重要。只有你的贡献以及它所激发和发展的关系。这是你能从这个世界带走的一切。因此，这是你在这个世界上时主要需要关注的事情。</p>
<p>What we are offering you here is freedom—the freedom to live a real and balanced life. You need sufficient health. You need the essential relationships. You need what is adequate and necessary. Chasing after perfect health is like chasing after the perfect person. It can consume a lifetime, and if it does, it will be a lifetime that is wasted. For you will return to your Ancient Home with your gifts ungiven, and you will wonder what happened to you down there that you could not realize what you were to do, and you will say, “I don’t know what happened. I forgot, I guess. I must go back. I want to go back. This time I will remember. I know I can remember.” And you can say this because it is so clear when you are Home! There you are! It is all so evident! There is nothing to cloud your vision. You are out of the water now, and you can see the situation clearly.</p>
<p>我们在这里为你提供的是自由——过上一种真实而平衡的生命自由。你需要足够的健康。你需要必要的关系。你需要足够和必要的东西。追求完美的健康就像追求完美的人一样。它会消耗你的一生，如果真是这样，那将是浪费的一生。因为你将带着未得到的礼物回到你的古老家园，你会想知道在那里发生了什么，以至于你无法意识到你该做什么，你会说，“我不知道发生了什么。我忘了，我想。我必须回去。我想回去。这次我会记得。我知道我能记得。”你可以这么说，因为当你回到家时，一切都是如此清晰！你就在那里！一切都是如此明显！没有什么能遮蔽你的视线。你现在已经脱离困境，你可以清楚地看到情况。</p>
<p>Look at your body and say, “You need to serve the purpose that has brought me into the world. I will take care of you for this, and I will appreciate you for this. And I will preserve your abilities for this. And when we are done, I shall thank you and bless you and leave you.” This is honoring the body and recognizing its true function in your life. Here you do not make the mistake of thinking that the body is the same as your mind or Spirit. You recognize its mechanism, you accept its requirements and its maintenance, you appreciate its service and you ask no more of it.</p>
<p>看着你的身体，说：“你需要服务于把我带到这个世界上的目的。我会照顾你，我会感激你。我会保留你的能力。当我们结束时，我会感谢你，祝福你，然后离开你。”这是对身体的尊重，承认它在你的生命中的真正运作。在这里，你不会犯这样的错误：认为身体和你的心灵或精神是一样的。你承认它的机制，你接受它的要求和维护，你感激它的服务，你不再要求它了。</p>
<p>Now, let us consider the question of mental health, the health of the mind. Here we will present some very fundamental ideas that may be hard to understand at first, for they must be deeply considered, like much of what we are presenting here. Let us begin with some useful definitions and then we shall expand upon them together. The mind, like the body, is in service to the Spirit. That is its fundamental role. However, to establish this role, and to come to realize the mind’s great value, you must reverse the order of authority.</p>
<p>现在，让我们来考虑一下心理健康、心灵健康的问题。在这里，我们将提出一些非常基本的想法，这些想法一开始可能很难理解，因为它们必须经过深思熟虑，就像我们在这里提出的许多内容一样。让我们从一些有用的定义开始，然后我们将一起扩展它们。心灵和身体一样，服务于精神。这是它的基本角色。然而，要确立这个角色，并认识到心灵的巨大价值，你必须颠倒权威的顺序。</p>
<p>Before you begin the reclamation of Knowledge, the mind is seen as serving the body and the Spirit is seen as serving the mind, so the whole order of service is reversed and the body is the main thing—the pleasure of the body, the health of the body, the appearance of the body, the comforts of the body. The mind must struggle slavishly to provide all of these things endlessly. And because the body is an imperfect instrument and susceptible to pain, to injury and to illness, the mind cannot seem to do enough for it. It is like the driver who spends all of his or her time taking care of the car! It is upside down. It is reversed from how it needs to be. The car is supposed to serve the driver, not the other way around.</p>
<p>在你开始重新获得内识之前，人们认为心灵服务于身体，而精神服务于心灵，因此整个服务顺序被颠倒过来，身体成为主要事物——身体的愉悦、身体的健康、身体的外观、身体的舒适。心灵必须无休止地努力提供所有这些东西。而且由于身体是一个不完美的工具，容易受到疼痛、伤害和疾病的影响，心灵似乎无法为它做足够的事情。它就像司机把所有的时间都花在照顾汽车上！这是颠倒过来的。这与它应该的状态是相反的。汽车应该为司机服务，而不是相反。</p>
<p>In the case of your life, the driver is the Spirit. The control panel is the mind. And the physical vehicle is the body. The mind here serves as an intermediary between physical life and spiritual reality, and the mind lives in its own environment, called the mental environment, the environment in which the mind affects other minds. It is the environment of thought. It is a distinct environment from the physical reality though they are interrelated and affect one another.</p>
<p>就你的生命而言，驾驶员是精神。控制面板是心灵。而物质的载体是身体。心灵在这里充当着物质生命和精神现实之间的中介，心灵生活在它自身的环境中，被称为心理环境，在这个环境中，心灵影响着其他心灵。它是思想的环境。它是一个与物质现实截然不同的环境，尽管它们相互关联并相互影响。</p>
<p>Therefore, let us begin with an important definition: A mind in service to Knowledge is a mind that is expressing itself. A mind that is in service to itself is a mind that is in disarray, confused and lacks this fundamental health and fundamental relationship. When you are out of relationship with Knowledge, your mind must serve something because it was made to serve, so it will serve its ideas, it will defend its ideas, and it will protect its ideas. It will even destroy itself to do this because the mind is a vehicle. It is not the source of creativity. A mind without Knowledge is slavish and redundant. It is defensive and suspicious. It is fundamentally afraid because it is alone and lacks a real foundation for living in the world. You have experienced this fear. You have experienced this anxiety. You have experienced this vulnerability and this defensiveness. The mind needs to serve something greater to find its rightful place in life and to fully utilize its great resources.</p>
<p>因此，让我们从一个重要的定义开始：一个服务于内识的心灵是一个表达它自己的心灵。一个服务于它自己的心灵是一个混乱、困惑并且缺乏这种根本健康和根本关系的心灵。当你与内识失去关系时，你的心灵必须服务于某种事物，因为它生来就是为了服务，所以它将服务于它的想法，它将捍卫它的想法，它将保护它的想法。它甚至会为了做到这一点而毁灭它自己，因为心灵是一个载体。它不是创造力的来源。一个没有内识的心灵是奴性的和多余的。它是防御性的和多疑的。它从根本上是恐惧的，因为它是孤独的，缺乏生活在这个世界上的真正基础。你经历过这种恐惧。你经历过这种焦虑。你经历过这种脆弱性和这种防御性。心灵需要服务于一种更伟大的内识，才能在生命中找到它应有的位置，并充分善于它的伟大资源。</p>
<p>The mind will struggle along the way because it does not want to give up the authority that it has claimed for itself. It is like the servant who has attempted to take over the kingdom in the absence of the king. It needs to relinquish its control because it cannot own it. This is not its dominion.</p>
<p>心灵会一路挣扎，因为心灵不想放弃它为它自己宣称的权威。它就像在国王不在时试图接管王国的仆人。它需要放弃控制权，因为它无法拥有它。这不是它的领地。</p>
<p>The mind must serve. The body must serve. So you go from the hierarchy that says, “The mind serves the body. And the Spirit serves the mind,” to the reality of life everywhere, which illustrates that the body serves the mind and the mind serves the Spirit.</p>
<p>心灵必须服务。身体也必须服务。因此，你从“心灵服务于身体，精神服务于心灵”的等级制度出发，到处都是生命的现实，这说明身体服务于心灵，心灵服务于精神。</p>
<p>You see in the world about you all of the terrible manifestations of mental illness. It is pervasive. It is manifest everywhere around you. You can see its effects even in your own life. People suffer because they lack meaning. People are lost because they do not belong to anything. People are expected to become heroes and heroines, self-sufficient and self-determining, and yet that is not the way of life. People are ambivalent because they are afraid of pain, and they do not know where pain comes from.</p>
<p>你在周围的世界中看到了各种可怕的心理疾病表现。它无处不在。它体现在你周围的每一个地方。你甚至在你自身的生命中也能看到它的影响。人们受苦是因为他们缺乏意义。人们迷失是因为他们没有归属感。人们被期望成为英雄和女英雄，自给自足和自决，但这并不是生命的方式。人们感到矛盾，因为他们害怕痛苦，他们不知道痛苦从何而来。</p>
<p>The mind cannot rule because it is a servant. It makes a very poor ruler. It cannot establish reality. It cannot create a stable and meaningful foundation for living in the world. It cannot establish your true identity. It cannot provide a basis for meaningful and lasting relationships. It cannot create a greater and more fulfilling purpose in life.</p>
<p>心灵无法统治，因为它是一个仆人。它是一个非常糟糕的统治者。它无法确立现实。它无法为生活在世界上创造一个稳定而有意义的基础。它无法确立你的真实身份。它无法为有意义和持久的关系提供一个基础。它无法创造一个更伟大、更充实的生命宗旨。</p>
<p>To expect the mind to do these things is to tax it mercilessly and to lead it to failure and disappointment again and again. It is cruel to treat the mind like this, just as it is cruel to treat the body as an instrument to offset the mind’s insecurity. There is no kindness in expecting the mind to be the primary authority in your life.</p>
<p>期望心灵做这些事情就是在无情地折磨它，并一次又一次地导致它失败和失望。这样对待心灵是残忍的，就像把身体当作抵消心灵不安全感的工具一样残忍。期望心灵成为你生命中的主要权威，这并不是仁慈。</p>
<p>Your personal mind, the mind that you have developed in order to negotiate the world and to survive here, is a wonderful instrument. It is a beautiful mechanism. It is not eternal, however. It can live for short periods of time beyond the body, but it too must fade away. Only what is essential within remains.</p>
<p>你的个人心灵，即你为了适应这个世界和在这里生存而发展出来的心灵，是一个奇妙的工具。它是一个美丽的机制。然而，它不是永恒的。它可以在身体之外存活很短的时间，但它也必须消亡。只有内在本质的内识才会留存。</p>
<p>Discovering what is essential within you while you are in the world is the greatest discovery, the most important endeavor, the greatest activity, because only Knowledge carries the purpose that you have brought with you from your Ancient Home. Only Knowledge knows whom you really need to meet in this world and what you need to do. Only Knowledge understands your mental and your physical natures and their appropriate designs.</p>
<p>当你身处世界时，发现你内在最本质的内识是最伟大的发现、最重要的事业、最伟大的活动，因为只有内识承载着你从古老家园带来的目的。只有内识知道你在这个世界上真正需要遇见谁、你需要做什么。只有内识理解你的心理和你生理的自然以及它们适当的设计。</p>
<p>In the absence of Knowledge, people create great and grandiose ideas, tremendous philosophies and cosmologies, enormous ideas, and great mental complexities. But the real question is whether you are with life or not, whether you are in relationship with the real nature of the world and its direction and development and with your real nature and its expression in life. This is the real question. It is not how great your ideas are or how encompassing your philosophy about life is.</p>
<p>在缺乏内识的情况下，人们创造了伟大而宏大的想法、惊人的哲学和宇宙观、庞大的想法和巨大的心理复杂性。但真正的问题是，你是否与生命同在，你是否与世界的真实自然及其方向和发展以及你的真实自然及其在生命中的表达建立关系。这是真正的问题。问题不在于你的想法有多伟大，也不在于你的生命哲学有多包罗万象。</p>
<p>Seeing and thinking in a larger way can only be the result of living a greater life, a life of Knowledge. Your thoughts will broaden and expand because your experience will broaden and expand. Your thoughts will be inclusive because you will experience inclusiveness in your life. And your thinking will be balanced because your life will be balanced.</p>
<p>以更广阔的视角去看待和思考只能是过着一种更伟大生命，一种内识生命的结果。你的思想将拓宽和扩展，因为你的经历将拓宽和扩展。你的思想将具有包容性，因为你将在生命中体验包容性。你的思维将保持平衡，因为你的生命将保持平衡。</p>
<p>Between the life of the mind and the life of the heart there is a great gulf, a huge chasm, with no apparent bottom. The distance between the two seems insurmountable. Yet there is a way to bridge it. You must build the bridge, however, which is the foundation. The bridge has Four Pillars, and once the bridge has been built sufficiently, things can travel over that bridge. A life with this foundation is like a bridge between the world and your Ancient Home. Over this bridge ideas, strength, insight, and recognition can come into your life to be given to others because you will have built the bridge that makes the transmission of greater Knowledge and Wisdom possible.</p>
<p>内心的生命与心灵的生命之间存在着巨大的鸿沟，一条深不见底的鸿沟。两者之间的距离似乎无法逾越。然而，有一种方法可以弥合它。然而，你必须建造桥梁，也就是基础。这座桥有四根支柱，一旦桥建好了，生命就可以通过这座桥。有了这个基础的生命就像是世界和你的古老家园之间的桥梁。通过这座桥，想法、力量、洞察力和认知可以进入你的生命，并传递给他人，因为你已经搭建了这座桥，使更伟大的内识和智慧的传播成为可能。</p>
<p>Your mind is part of the bridge and your body is part of the bridge. You must have sufficient health physically and mentally to build this bridge. Like your body, your mind does not need to be perfect—without flaw, without error, without pain, and without discomfort. It just needs to be able to function adequately and to relinquish the reins of life to a Greater Power, which it is in fact designed to serve.</p>
<p>你的心灵是桥梁的一部分，你的身体也是桥梁的一部分。你必须拥有足够的身心健康才能建造这座桥梁。就像你的身体一样，你的心灵不需要完美无缺——没有瑕疵、没有错误、没有痛苦、没有不适。它只需要能够充分运作，并将生命的缰绳交给一个更伟大的力量，事实上，它被设计来服务于这个更伟大的力量。</p>
<p>This relinquishment does not happen all at once. It happens incrementally, and the opportunity for it to happen occurs every time that you have to make a serious decision. Here you can ask yourself, “What do I think and what do I want?” and then ask yourself, “Is there something I really know about this?”</p>
<p>这种放弃不会一下子发生。它会逐渐发生，每次你必须做出一个严肃的决定时，它都有机会发生。这时你可以问你自己：“我在想什么？我想要什么？”然后问你自己：“我真的知道这件事吗？”</p>
<p>It is a curious thing that when you discover through experience that what you know is different from what you want, which is often a very confusing and frustrating recognition, only then will you realize that Knowledge is real and not a figment of your imagination and is not simply emanating from your wishful thinking. When what you know and what you want are different, this proves the reality of Knowledge to you. Then you will see that Knowledge is not simply a figment of your own will or insecurity and that Knowledge has a reality and an intelligence all its own, a reality and an intelligence that cannot be swayed by your impulses, your fears, your desires or anything in the world.</p>
<p>奇怪的是，当你通过经验发现你所知道的和你想要的不一样时，这种认识往往令人困惑和沮丧，只有那时你才会意识到内识是真实的，而不是你想象的产物，也不仅仅是你一厢情愿的想法。当你所知道的和你想要的不一样时，这就向你证明了内识的现实性。然后你就会看到内识不仅仅是你自己的意志或不安全感的产物，内识有它自己的一种现实和一种智能，它不会被你的冲动、你的恐惧、你的欲望或世界上的任何事情所左右。</p>
<p>Knowledge is the only part of you that is beyond temptation and beyond manipulation and control. It is the foundation of your life, and as you will see in the future, it is the most important endowment that you have. In the preparation in Steps to Knowledge, your mind is oriented towards Knowledge, to think more in line with Knowledge. This is done so that your mind can become a bridge for Knowledge and a vehicle for Knowledge. The mind is not repudiated. The mind is not disdained. The mind is not denied. The mind is not destroyed. It is re-employed. It is brought back into harmony with its true relationship with Knowledge, its true relationship with Spirit.</p>
<p>内识是你唯一不受诱惑、不受操纵和控制的部分。它是你生命的基础，正如你将来会看到的，它是你拥有的最重要的天赋。在内识进阶的准备中，你的心灵面向内识，以更符合内识的方式思考。这样做是为了让你的心灵能够成为内识的桥梁和内识的载体。心灵不会被否定。心灵不会被鄙视。心灵不会被拒绝。心灵不会被摧毁。它只会被重新雇用。它被带回到与内识的真正关系、与精神的真正关系的和谐中。</p>
<p>As this is accomplished over time, you will experience real harmony in your life. You will look at the body compassionately and realize its value, and you will look at your mind compassionately and realize its value. The mind and the body are both instruments of communication and vehicles of existence in the physical world. They both need to function, not perfectly but adequately.</p>
<p>随着时间的流逝，你会在生命中感受到真正的和谐。你会同情地看待身体并意识到它的价值，你也会同情地看待你的心灵并意识到它的价值。心灵和身体都是物质世界中沟通的工具和存在的载体。它们都需要发挥作用，不是完美无缺，而是充分发挥。</p>
<p>However, because most people are not aware that Knowledge is a reality beyond their mind, the mind then becomes greatly amplified. People become very involved in it. In fact, just like people can become obsessed with their bodies, they can also become obsessed with their minds—with their feelings, with their thoughts, with their emotional states, with their memories, with their future ideas, with their theories, with their philosophies, with their fears, with their terrors, and so forth. And oh, the mind looks so big and so dominant! And oh, it is so confusing with so many levels! And it seems unfathomable. It is layers and layers and layers of thinking. The mind seems to overwhelm existence, and you feel enslaved to its will and to its impulses.</p>
<p>然而，由于大多数人没有察觉到内识是一种超越他们心灵的现实，因此心灵就会被极大地放大。人们变得非常沉迷于它。事实上，就像人们会沉迷于他们的身体一样，他们也会沉迷于他们的心灵——沉迷于他们的感觉、他们的思想、他们的情绪状态、他们的记忆、他们对未来的想法、他们的理论、他们的哲学、他们的恐惧、他们的恐怖等等。哦，心灵看起来是如此庞大、如此占据主导地位！哦，它是如此令人困惑，有如此多的层面！它似乎深不可测。它是层层叠叠的思维。心灵似乎压倒了存在，你感觉到你被它的意志和冲动所奴役。</p>
<p>Where can freedom be found? Freedom is found in bringing the mind in service to Knowledge. Freedom is found in reversing the order of authority. If you are a slave to your mind, then the order of authority is reversed from what it should be. If the mind cannot be employed, it will run wild. If the mind cannot be directed, it shoots around in all directions. If the mind cannot have authority within you, it will become a slave to other minds in the mental environment.</p>
<p>自由在哪里？自由存在于让心灵服务于内识之中。自由存在于颠倒权威的秩序之中。如果你是心灵的奴隶，那么权威秩序就会与它应有的秩序相反。如果心灵无法被雇用，它就会失控。如果心灵无法被引导，它就会四处乱窜。如果心灵无法在你内在拥有权威，它就会成为心理环境中其他心灵的奴隶。</p>
<p>The real authority of the mind is Knowledge. Because the Creator’s Plan is perfect, the Plan calls for the establishment of true authority within yourself. Here you are not asked to give your life to the Divine, at least not to the Divine that is far, far away from you. It is not the purpose of the Creator to be your case manager, to come in and to direct all of your activities. Do not think that the Creator of the universe is going to become preoccupied with your daily ups and downs, with all of your feelings, thoughts, fears and concerns, and all of the little decisions which preoccupy you.</p>
<p>心灵的真正权威是内识。因为造物主的计划是完美的，所以计划要求在你自己内心建立真正的权威。在这里，你不会被要求将你的生命献给神圣，至少不会献给离你很远很远的神圣。造物主的目的不是成为你的案例经理，来指导你的所有活动。不要认为宇宙的造物主会专注于你每天的起起落落，专注于你所有的感受、想法、恐惧和担忧，以及所有让你心烦意乱的小决定。</p>
<p>No, the Creator has given you Knowledge for this. It is within you. Bring yourself to Knowledge and you bring yourself to the Creator. For God can only be known. Knowledge can only be known. And life can only be known. Thinking, philosophizing, speculating, analyzing, evaluating, criticizing do not bring you back into relationship without Knowledge.</p>
<p>不，造物主已经为此赋予了你内识。它就在你的内心。把你自己带向内识，你就会将你自己带向造物主。因为上帝只能被知道。内识只能被知道。生命也只能被知道。没有内识，思考、哲学思考、推测、分析、评价、批评都无法让你重新回到关系中。</p>
<p>In Steps to Knowledge your mind is oriented towards thinking productively and creatively. It is given direction. It is given purpose. It is given meaning. Then it becomes able to serve rather than to destroy. It is able to become a vehicle to extend your life into the world rather than an obstruction. However, for the mind to be able to come into proximity to Knowledge and to regain its natural relationship to Knowledge, it must undergo the preparation in The Way of Knowledge.</p>
<p>在内识进阶中，你的心灵被导向富有成效和创造性的思维。它被赋予方向。它被赋予目的。它被赋予意义。然后它就能够服务而不是破坏。它能够成为一种将你的生命延伸到这个世界的工具，而不是一种障碍。然而，为了让心灵能够接近内识并重新获得它与内识的自然关系，它必须接受内识之路上的准备。</p>
<p>There are no magic tricks here. There are no secret formulas. You do not take some strange-looking pill and wake up the next day in a state of Knowledge. You must build the bridge. You must construct the foundation. That is your work. The Creator will do the work once the foundation is established, and the Creator, through the Unseen Ones, will enable you and support you in building the bridge and the foundation. But you must show up for the job. You must apply your mind and your body to the job. You must become prepared to do the job. And you must do the work.</p>
<p>这里没有魔术。没有秘密配方。你不会吃下一些奇怪的药丸，第二天醒来后就会处于内识状态。你必须建造桥梁。你必须打好地基。这是你的工作。一旦基础建立起来，造物主就会开始工作，而造物主会通过不可见者，帮助你建造桥梁和地基。但你必须出现在工作岗位上。你必须将你的心灵和身体投入到工作中。你必须做好准备去做这项工作。你必须做这项工作。</p>
<p>At this point, let us present an important idea: Many people approach spirituality and religion primarily because they want reassurance, shelter and comfort. They want a place to come in from the storm of life. They want to find reprieve. They want to experience acceptance and forgiveness. All these things are available, but more is presented to you and much more is asked of you.</p>
<p>在这一点上，让我们提出一个重要的想法：许多人接触精神性和宗教主要是因为他们想要保证、庇护和安慰。他们想要一个可以躲避生命风暴的地方。他们想要得到喘息。他们想要体验接纳和宽恕。所有这些都是可以获得的，但更多的事情会呈现在你面前，对你的要求也会更多。</p>
<p>People often think of God as a giant welfare system—spiritual welfare! You just sign up and then you collect your checks, and you receive your dispensations, and you are given your gifts and your miracles. You just have to believe in the system. Then God will come and serve you and do all these little things for you, as if God had nothing better to do in the universe than to cater to your wishes! Only a pathetic God would be so involved!</p>
<p>人们常常认为上帝是一个巨大的福利体系——精神福利！你只要报名，然后领取支票，接受豁免，就能得到礼物和奇迹。你只需要相信这个体系。然后上帝就会来为你服务，为你做所有这些小事，好像上帝在宇宙中除了满足你的愿望之外没有更好的事情可做！只有可悲的上帝才会如此投入！</p>
<p>This is not spiritual welfare. We are not offering you welfare. We are offering you work. We are giving you a job. We are giving you a context and a foundation, a purpose, a meaning and a direction so that you may regain your natural abilities, bring them into harmony and alignment with each other, and build a real foundation for Knowledge. Do not think, “Well, what is God going to do for me?” God has already given you Knowledge. If you could understand and see how great an endowment this is, you would know that you had been given what you need to find your way in this world and to find your community in this world.</p>
<p>这不是精神福利。我们不是在给你提供福利。我们是在给你提供工作。我们是在给你一份工作。我们是在给你一个背景和一个基础、一个目的、一个意义和一个方向，这样你就能重新获得你的自然能力，让它们彼此和谐一致，并为内识构建一个真正的基础。不要想：“好吧，上帝会为我做什么？”上帝已经赋予了你内识。如果你能理解并看到这是一份多么伟大的馈赠，你就会知道，你已经得到了你所需要的东西，来找到你在这个世界上的道路，找到你在这个世界上的社区。</p>
<p>However, as long as the order of authority is reversed, as long as the mind serves the body and the Spirit seems to serve the mind, there will be physical and mental disability. Your physical problems will be greatly amplified, and your mental problems will be greatly amplified, and you will tend to become obsessed with your little problems and with the little problems of life.</p>
<p>然而，只要权威的顺序被颠倒过来，只要心灵服务于身体，而精神似乎服务于心灵，就会出现生理和心理上的残疾。你生理上的问题会大大放大，你心理上的问题也会大大放大，你会倾向于沉迷于你的小问题和生命中的小问题。</p>
<p>Little problems are escaped and resolved when the greater problems of life are addressed. Little problems are forgiven and accepted when your energy is dedicated to the greater problems in life. The greater problem in life is finding the way to Knowledge in order to realize why you are here and to engage yourself fully in the reclamation and the expression of Knowledge. Knowledge is regained by dedicating yourself to those individuals who represent your true allies in The Way of Knowledge. It is given through dedication and devotion. It is not based on personal reward or on gaining more welfare from God or from the world. It is dedicated to finding the essential contribution that has brought you into the world and with it the memory of those who have sent you and who abide with you even now.</p>
<p>当生命中更大的问题得到解决时，小问题就会得到逃避和解决。当你把精力奉献给生命中更大的问题时，小问题就会得到原谅和接受。生命中更大的问题是找到通向内识的道路，以便认识到你为何在此，并充分投入到内识的恢复和表达中。内识是通过把你自己奉献给那些在内识之路上代表你真正盟友的个体而重新获得的。它是通过专注和奉献而被赋予。它不是基于个人回报，也不是从上帝或从世界获得更多福利。它致力于寻找把你带到这个世界的根本贡献，以及那些派遣你、甚至现在仍然和你同在的不可见者的记忆。</p>
<p>Health is vitality, but vitality is the product of living a real life. It is the product of facing the risks and opportunities of life. It is the product of real relationship and real dedication that can be shared between people. It is the result of experiencing the true hierarchy of authority in your life and holding in reverence and respect the different aspects of your nature and the different levels of existence. Then you go to the doctor simply to keep your body running so that it can continue to support your purpose. And you make adjustments in your thinking and in your behavior as they become necessary. You are able to do this because you are serving a greater purpose. And your spiritual life and reality can then find expression in your thinking and in your actions in the world. This is health. This is the demonstration of well-being. This is the demonstration of a greater truth and a greater reality that is a potential in all people.</p>
<p>健康就是活力，但是活力是过着一种真实生命的产物。它是面对生命的风险和机遇的产物。它是人们之间能够共享的真正关系和真正奉献的产物。它是体验你生命中真正的权威等级制度并敬畏和尊重你自然的不同面向和不同存在层面的结果。然后你去看医生只是为了让你的身体保持运转，这样它就能继续支持你的目的。你在必要时调整你的思维和行为。你能够这样做，因为你在服务于一个更伟大目的。你的精神生命和现实随后能够在你的思维和你在世界上的行动中找到表达。这就是健康。这是幸福的体现。这是所有人身上都潜藏的一个更伟大真理和一个更伟大现实的体现。</p>
<p>This is what The Way of Knowledge is for—to enable you to fulfill your mission here and to find those who share your mission with you. It is to find freedom and escape from all the myriad disabling activities that cripple humanity and that render it helpless in the face of its own needs and in the face of the Greater Community, which is overshadowing the world at this time.</p>
<p>这就是内识之路的目的——让你能够实现你在此的使命，并找到那些与你共享使命的人。它是为了找到自由，摆脱所有无数使人类陷入困境的破坏性活动，这些活动使人类在面对它自身的需求和面对此刻笼罩着世界的大社区时的无能为力。</p>
<p>Greater truth is needed in your life, for your well-being and for the well-being of the world, for you have not come here for yourself alone. You have come here for the world. That is how great you are in truth. That is how great your purpose is, and that is how great your reward will be as you reclaim the essential aspect of your life.</p>
<p>你的生命需要更伟大的真理，为了你的福祉，为了世界的福祉，因为你来到这里不仅仅是为了你自己。你是为世界而来。这就是你的伟大之处。这就是你目的的伟大，当你重新找回生命的本质时，你的回报将有多么伟大。</p>
<p>Then, if there is illness, accident or injury, you will simply find what is needed to make the adjustments or the repairs that are necessary so that you can keep going because you have somewhere to go and you have something to do. Then these things will not be exaggerated, these things will not be overemphasized, and these things will not dominate your life and attention. And though you may have aches and pains as you proceed, you will continue, and you will fulfill your destiny here.</p>
<p>这样，如果有疾病、事故或伤害，你将简单地找到需要的东西，做出必要的调整或修复，这样你就能继续前行，因为你有地方可去，有事可做。这样，这些事情就不会被夸大，这些事情就不会被过分强调，这些事情就不会主宰你的生命和注意力。尽管你在前行过程中可能会有疼痛，但你将继续前行，你将实现你在此的天命。</p>
<p>Now, let us speak a little bit about good living. Eat well. Get enough sleep. Have daily exercise. Engage with the right people. Follow what you know. And keep asking for Knowledge. If you engage with the wrong people, it will undermine your health and well-being and will bring you back into confusion and disorientation. Follow what is simple and understood. Perhaps you have said to yourself, “I know I shouldn’t do this,” or “I know I should do that.” Go do it. Do what you know. Why hesitate? What are you waiting for? Do not wait until a crisis occurs. Do not wait until a little problem has become a big problem. There is much you know already that you need to do to maintain your body and to have greater health mentally. Do those things. Do not ask for more. For you cannot use more until you use what you have today.</p>
<p>现在，让我们谈谈美好的生活。吃好。睡好。每天锻炼。与正确的人交往。遵循你所知道的。并不断寻求内识。如果你与错误的人交往，它就会损害你的健康和福祉，并会让你再次陷入困惑和迷失方向。遵循简单易懂的内识。也许你对你自己说过，“我知道我不应该这样做”，或者“我知道我应该那样做”。去做吧。做你知道的事。为什么要犹豫？你在等什么？不要等到危机发生。不要等到小问题变成大问题。你已经知道你需要做很多事情来保持你的身体和拥有更健康的心理。去做那些事情。不要要求更多。因为除非你用完你今天所拥有的，否则你无法使用更多。</p>
<p>People want to unite with the Divine, but they cannot even be with one other person. People want to have radiant health or peace of mind, but how can they if they cannot even do the simple tasks that they know they need to do today? Start where you are. Start with what you know. Enlist others to help you do what you know and do not turn back. This is building the foundation. This is building the bridge from the world to your Ancient Home. This is utilizing every aspect of your life and making every part of your life vital.</p>
<p>人们想要与神圣结合，但他们甚至无法与另一个人在一起。人们想要拥有容光焕发的健康或心灵的和平，但如果他们甚至无法完成他们知道今天需要做的简单任务，他们又怎么能做到呢？从你所在的地方开始。从你所知道的开始。招募其他人来帮助你做你所知道的事情，不要回头。这是在建立基础。这是在建立从世界到你的古老家园的桥梁。这是在善用你生命的每一个方面，让你生命的每一部分都变得至关重要。</p>
<p>Come close to Knowledge and Knowledge will feel close to you, and you will know what to do. But even beyond this, you will be able to do what you know.</p>
<p>接近内识，内识就会感觉离你很近，你就会知道该做什么。但即便如此，你也能做你所知道的事。</p>
