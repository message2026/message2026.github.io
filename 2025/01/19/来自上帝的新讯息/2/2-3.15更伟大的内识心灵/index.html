<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 1, 2007 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2007 年 10 月 1 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two great events that humanity is now facing, events greater than anything that humanity as a whole has ever encountered before.</p>
<p>人类现在正面临两件大事，这两件大事比人类以前所遇到的任何事都要大。</p>
<p>You are facing the Great Waves of change, brought about by environmental disruption and misuse of the world’s resources; violent weather; environmental degradation; diminishing energy, food and water resources—great environmental changes that will make life in this world more difficult, literally for everyone, including people in the wealthy nations. This is just beginning to be well documented in your world today, but its impact will be great and far reaching and will literally change the landscape of the world so that the 21st century will be very different from the 20th century.</p>
<p>你们正面临变革的巨浪，这是由环境破坏和世界资源滥用、恶劣天气、环境恶化、能源、粮食和水资源减少等因素引起的——巨大的环境变化将使这个世界的生命更加困难，几乎对每个人来说都是如此，包括富裕国家的人们。今天，这才刚刚开始在你们的世界得到充分记录，但它的影响将是巨大而深远的，并将彻底改变世界的面貌，使 21 世纪与 20 世纪截然不同。</p>
<p>The other great challenge and change facing the human family is your encounter with intelligent life from the Greater Community, from the universe around you. Very few people in the world today are aware that contact is occurring, and the vast majority of those few who are, do not understand it correctly. This contact has the power to deny humanity its freedom in the future, to cast human civilization under foreign control and domination.</p>
<p>人类大家庭面临的另一个伟大挑战和变革是你们与来自大社区、来自你们周围宇宙的智能生命的相遇。当今世界上很少有人察觉到接触正在发生，而那些察觉到这种接触的人中的绝大多数都没有正确的理解。这种接触有能力剥夺人类未来的自由，将人类文明置于外国的控制和统治之下。</p>
<p>It is not conquest in the usual sense of someone coming and violently overtaking you, for those who seek to gain control of the world and the world’s peoples are small in number and do not have military assets. That is not their strength. They are cunning and intelligent. They realize they could gain control of this world through non-military means, and they are seeking to do so even at this moment.</p>
<p>它不是通常意义上的征服，不是有人突然闯进来，用暴力将你赶走，因为那些试图控制世界和世界人们的干预者数量很少，也没有军事资产。这不是他们的强项。他们狡猾而聪明。他们意识到他们可以通过非军事手段控制这个世界，他们甚至在此刻就寻求这样做。</p>
<p>There are very few people in the world today who are aware of the Great Waves of change that are coming, and what they really signify, and the kind of impact and consequences they could create in the world, both now and in the future. There are very few people in the world today who realize that an Intervention is occurring from beyond the world and that it represents a competition for power here—for power, influence and future control.</p>
<p>当今世界很少有人察觉到正在来临的变革巨浪，以及它们真正意味着什么，以及它们可能给世界带来什么样的影响和后果，无论是现在还是未来。当今世界很少有人意识到一种干预正在从世界外发生，它代表着一种对权力的竞争——对权力、影响力和未来控制的竞争。</p>
<p>Together, these things will indeed be overwhelming if you can face them. Indeed, there are some people who are beginning to be aware of them but cannot face them because they are overwhelming, because they will require you to change, and to re-evaluate your circumstances and your situation, and where you stand in your position with life itself.</p>
<p>总之，如果你能面对这些事情，它们确实会令人难以忍受。事实上，有些人开始察觉到这些事情，但却无法面对它们，因为它们令人难以忍受，因为它们会要求你做出改变，重新评估你的环境和处境，以及你在生命中的位置。</p>
<p>So there is ignorance and there is human denial. But the Great Waves of change are coming, and the Intervention is already occurring. These are two great realities that you cannot change, but the outcome is largely in the hands of human beings and human communities.</p>
<p>因此存在着无知和人类的否认。但变革的巨浪正在到来，干预已经发生。这是两个你无法改变的重大现实，但结果很大程度上掌握在人类和人类社区的手中。</p>
<p>The first great challenge is to face the great challenges that are coming into your life. Though they may seem overwhelming and terrifying to your mind—to your thinking mind—the deeper Knowledge that God has placed within you is well prepared for them. Indeed, seen from a greater perspective, this is why you have come into the world—to serve humanity and to contribute to a world in need, facing these two very great challenges.</p>
<p>第一个伟大挑战是面对即将进入你生命的伟大挑战。尽管它们对你的心灵——对你的思维心灵——来说似乎势不可挡、令人恐惧，但上帝放置在你内在的更深层次的内识已经为它们做好了充分准备。事实上，从更伟大的视角来看，这就是你来到这个世界的原因——为人类服务、为一个需要帮助的世界做处贡献，面对这两个非常伟大的挑战。</p>
<p>You must have a greater perspective to see and understand this, a greater sense of yourself, a greater recognition that you have come into the world for a greater purpose—not merely to survive, not merely to consume, not merely to gratify yourself, but to serve humanity at a time of its greatest need. To go from your current understanding to this greater understanding represents the purpose and the necessity of your spiritual growth and awakening.</p>
<p>你必须拥有一种更伟大的视角去看见和理解这一点，一种对你自己更伟大的感觉，一种更伟大的认知，你来到这个世界是为了一个更伟大的目的——不只是为了生存，不只是为了消费，不只是为了满足你自己，而是为了在人类最需要的时候服务人类。从你当前的理解走向这个更伟大的理解，代表着你精神的成长和觉醒的目的和必要性。</p>
<p>To shift from purely a human perspective of one who is afraid of death, afraid of loss, who is trying to acquire as much as possible for themselves to this greater understanding that you have come into the world for a higher purpose represents the great transition that you must undertake if you are to be able to navigate the difficult times ahead and to fulfill your mission here in the world.</p>
<p>从纯粹的人类视角，即害怕死亡、害怕失去、试图为他们自己获取尽可能多的东西，转变为这种更伟大的理解，既你来到这个世界上是为了一个更高宗旨，这代表着你必须经历的伟大转变，如果你想要能够度过未来的艰难时期，并完成你在这个世界上的使命，你就必须经历这样的转变。</p>
<p>Your purpose here was established before you came into the world, but how it will be expressed will be determined by so many things, so many circumstances. Certainly, your own decisions are a big part of this, but what other people will choose will also have an impact on when and how and even if you can fulfill your destiny here.</p>
<p>你来到这个世界之前，你的目的就已经确定了，但如何实现它则取决于许多事情、许多情况。当然，你自身的决定是其中很重要的一部分，但其他人的选择也会影响你何时、如何甚至是否能够实现你在这里的天命。</p>
<p>There are certain individuals you will need to meet who hold some of the pieces to the puzzle of your life. Their arrival and participation in your life, if correctly seen and correctly understood, will enable you to make this great transition and will give you the strength, the encouragement and the companionship that you will need to be a real contributor in a radically changing world.</p>
<p>你需要结识特定的人，他们掌握着你生命拼图的特定部分。如果正确看待和理解他们的到来和参与，他们将帮助你完成这个伟大的转变，并给予你力量、鼓励和陪伴，而这些正是你在这个急剧变化的世界中真正做出贡献所需要的。</p>
<p>Here you must not be concerned about what everyone else is doing. Here you cannot allow yourself to lose heart and to become discouraged by the lack of awareness and response of people around you, for you have your own journey to take. You have your own calling to respond to. You have your own transition to undergo within your own life and with your own awareness.</p>
<p>在这里，你不必关心其他人在做什么。在这里，你不必让你自己灰心丧气，也不必因为周围人的缺乏觉知和缺乏回应而灰心丧气，因为你有你自己的旅程要走。你有你自己的召唤要回应。你有你自己的生命和你自己觉知要经历的转变。</p>
<p>God knew what you would be facing before you came into the world. God knows what is coming on the horizon of the world, even now. And God knows that you could not possibly recognize all these things and prepare correctly and accordingly without God’s Wisdom to assist you and without the Power of God to give you the courage and the commitment to prepare yourself for the Great Waves of change and for the Greater Community in such a way that you will be able to be a real contributor to the world and to the future and the freedom of humanity.</p>
<p>上帝在你来到这个世界之前就知道你将面对什么。上帝知道，甚至现在，世界的地平线上将会到来的变革巨浪。上帝知道，如果没有上帝的智慧来协助你，如果没有上帝的力量来赋予你勇气和承诺来为变革的巨浪和大社区进行准备，以便你能够成为对世界、对未来、对人类自由的一个真正贡献者，你就不可能认知所有这些事情，并做出正确且相应的准备。</p>
<p>God knows that your intellect alone cannot comprehend these greater movements of life. God knows that you would be far too affected by your social circumstances and the influence of other people to have much of a chance to be able to see these things clearly and to respond accordingly.</p>
<p>上帝知道，仅凭你的智力无法理解这些更伟大的生命运动。上帝知道，你太容易受到你的社会境遇和其他人的影响，以至于没有多少机会能够清晰地看清这些事情并做出相应的回应。</p>
<p>Therefore, God has given you part of God’s Wisdom, Intelligence and Power. You carry within you, then, a deeper Mind, a Mind beneath the mind, a Mind that God has placed there.</p>
<p>因此，上帝赋予了你一部分上帝的智慧、智能和力量。那么，你的内心就拥有一个更深层次的心灵，一个心灵之下的心灵，一个上帝放置于其中的心灵。</p>
<p>In reality, this is who you really are, this greater Mind of Knowledge that God has given you. That is the Mind you had before you came here, and it will be the Mind you have after you leave this place. It is alive within you now. And it is within you to guide you and to protect you, to help you make the corrections you need to make in your life, to build a foundation for the world, a foundation for yourself, and to assist and help in building a foundation for others so that humanity may have a future, a greater future than its past.</p>
<p>在现实中，这就是你真正的自我，上帝赋予你的这个更伟大的内识之心。就是你来到这里之前的心灵，也是你离开这里之后的心灵。它现在就活在你的内心。它就在你的内心，指引你、保护你，帮助你做出生命中需要做出的修正，为世界、为你自己构建一个基础，并协助和帮助为他人构建一个基础，这样人类才能拥有一个未来，一个比过去更伟大的未来。</p>
<p>Without this Knowledge, you would not be able to rise above the influence of the mental environment around you. It would be unlikely that you would be able to overcome your social conditioning and your religious prejudices and your personal attitudes sufficiently to be able to live a greater life and to provide a greater service in the world, a service you were sent here to perform.</p>
<p>没有这个内识，你将无法超越周遭心理环境的影响。你也不可能充分克服你的社会条件、你的宗教偏见和你的个人态度，从而能够过上一种更伟大的生命，为世界提供更伟大的服务，而这正是你被派到这里去履行的服务。</p>
<p>That is why God gave you Knowledge. It is not an intelligence you can manipulate. It is not something you can control or dominate. It is far more intelligent than your intellect. It is without fear. It is without confusion. It is without hostility. It does not need to compare and contrast and speculate. It does not need to dominate and control. It does not need to destroy others so that you may feel powerful.</p>
<p>正因为如此上帝赋予你内识。它不是一种你可以操控的智能。它不是某种你可以控制或支配的东西。它远比你的智力更加强大。它没有恐惧。它没有困惑。它没有敌意。它不需要比较、对照和推测。它不需要支配和控制。它不需要摧毁他人以便让你感受到强大。</p>
<p>In fact, it does not demonstrate most of the qualities of your intellect. This is because your intellect is a product of the world, and Knowledge is a creation of God. Your intellect reflects the world and your human-animal nature, but Knowledge reflects the Mind of God and your Divine nature. One is temporary. The other is permanent.</p>
<p>事实上，它并没有展现出你智力的大多数品质。这是因为你的智力是世界的产物，而内识是上帝的创造。你的智力反映了世界和你的人性，而内识反映了上帝的心灵和你的神圣自然。一个是暂时的。另一个是永久的。</p>
<p>Ultimately, in the true hierarchy of your Being, your intellect is meant to serve Knowledge. However, at the beginning, when most people realize they need to reclaim their true identity and their greater power and begin to take the Steps to Knowledge, they want Knowledge to serve their intellect. They want Knowledge to answer their questions and to allay their anxiety. They want Knowledge to give them things they want. They want Knowledge to serve them as if Knowledge were a servant of the intellect. But Knowledge is not the servant of the intellect.</p>
<p>最终，在你存在的真正层级中，你的智力注定要服务于内识。然而，一开始，当大多数人意识到他们需要重新找回他们的真实身份和他们更伟大的力量并开始开展内识的进阶时，他们希望内识服务于他们的智力。他们希望内识回答他们的问题并缓解他们的焦虑。他们希望内识给他们想要的东西。他们希望内识为他们服务，就好像内识是智力的仆人一样。但内识并不是智力的仆人。</p>
<p>Yet Knowledge is here to serve you and to serve the world. It is not afraid of the Great Waves of change. It is not afraid of Intervention from the Greater Community. In fact, it has been waiting for them, prepared for them.</p>
<p>然而内识在此服务于你、服务于世界。它不惧怕变革的巨浪。它不惧怕来自大社区的干预。事实上，它一直在等待它们、为它们做好准备。</p>
<p>How different this is from your intellect, your personal mind, which is terrified of the world, which is afraid of loss and deprivation, which is full of anger and rage against others, which can never seem to gain control of events around you sufficiently to provide any real security for you. The contrast between your intellect and Knowledge is so great, in fact, that you cannot even compare them. Yet this will seem mysterious to you until you can begin to experience Knowledge itself.</p>
<p>这与你的智力、你的个人心灵是多么不同啊，你的智力、你的个人心灵害怕这个世界，害怕失去和剥夺，对他人充满愤怒和狂怒，似乎永远无法充分控制你周围的事件，为你提供任何真正的安全。事实上，你的智力和内识之间的反差是如此之大，以至于你甚至无法将它们进行比较。然而，在你开始体验内识本身之前，这对你来说似乎是神秘的。</p>
<p>Your initial experiences of Knowledge will be at moments a sense of urgency or a sense of need to change; the recognition you must leave something; the recognition you must find something; an awareness of a future event that takes place; a moment of compassion and selflessness. All of these represent the evidence of Knowledge, which is still latent within you. It has not arisen in your awareness sufficiently that you can really experience its power and its efficacy.</p>
<p>你最初对内识的体验，有时是一种紧迫感或需要改变的感觉；认识到你必须离开某些东西；认识到你必须找到某些东西；觉知到未来将要发生的事情；感受到同情和无私的时刻。所有这些都代表着内识的证据，它仍然潜伏在你的内心深处。它还没有在你的觉知中充分出现，以至于你无法真正体验到它的力量和功效。</p>
<p>That is why you take the Steps to Knowledge, because you yourself need it desperately. All of the certainty and security you were trying to establish in your relationships, in your work, in your personal affairs, in your intellectual understanding—these can only be provided by Knowledge.</p>
<p>这就是为什么你要开展内识的进阶，因为你自己也迫切需要它。你试图在你的关系、工作、个人事务、智力理解中建立的所有确定性和安全性——这些只能由内识提供。</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, you are cast adrift in a world of dramatic change—a beautiful world, but a dangerous world as well. And all you can hope to do is adapt and to survive with as good an attitude as possible. But this is not your destiny in being here, to simply survive for a few years with as much courage and stability as you can muster. That is not why you were sent here.</p>
<p>没有内识，你就会在一个剧烈变化的世界里漂泊——一个美丽的世界，但也是一个危险的世界。你所能做的就是适应，并以尽可能好的心态生存下去。但这并不是你在这里的天命，不是简单地以你能鼓起的勇气和稳定生存几年。这不是你被派到这里的原因。</p>
<p>If you knew your true nature, this would be as clear as day. But Knowledge has not yet arisen in your mind sufficiently for you to have this awareness, for you to have the stability and the security and the power that Knowledge will give to you.</p>
<p>如果你知道你的真正自然，这一点就会一清二楚。但内识还未在你的心灵中充分升起，让你拥有这种觉知，让你拥有内识将赋予你的稳定性、安全性和力量。</p>
<p>Therefore, the most critical thing now is for you to realize your need for Knowledge—the recognition that you must find what you came here to do and that you cannot be wasting your time, your days, your months, your years with all of your restless searching and your fruitless pursuits, caught up in a web of desire and denial that leads you nowhere, that keeps you in a state of poverty.</p>
<p>因此，现在最关键的事情是你意识到你对内识的需求——认识到你必须找到你来此要做的事情，你不能把你的时间、你的日子、你的月份、你的岁月浪费在你所有不安的搜寻和你无果的追求上，你不能陷入一张欲望和否认的网络，这会让你无处可去，它会让你处于一种贫困的状态。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must feel the need for Knowledge and also to recognize that you have experienced it, however briefly in your past, and that you need this certainty and that you need this greater experience to know what to do. For in the face of the Great Waves of change, you will not know what to do. In the face of the Greater Community and the Intervention—should you become aware of it, should you have the courage to face it—you will not know what to do. You will feel hopeless and helpless in the face of these two great events.</p>
<p>因此，你必须感觉到对内识的需求，同时也必须认识到你曾经体验过它，无论它在你的过去多么短暂，你需要这种确定性，你需要这种更伟大体验来知道该做什么。因为面对变革的巨浪，你将不知道该做什么。面对大社区和干预——如果你察觉到它，如果你有勇气面对它——你将不知道该做什么。面对这两件伟大事件，你将感到绝望和无助。</p>
<p>But Knowledge within you is not hopeless, and it is not helpless. It will begin to reset your life and to build strength where it is needed and to reorient your awareness to greater things that are happening in the world and to the greater movement of life that is occurring, even within you.</p>
<p>但是，你内心的内识并不是无望的，也不是无助的。它将开始重置你的生命，在需要的地方积蓄力量，并将你的觉知重新定位到世界上正在发生的更伟大事情上，以及正在发生的更伟大的生命运动，甚至就在你的内心深处。</p>
<p>Therefore, at the beginning, it is recognizing the need for Knowledge and then taking the Steps to Knowledge. The New Message that God has sent into the world, the New Message for humanity, provides the Steps to Knowledge. There are other pathways to take, but nothing as clear as this.</p>
<p>因此，一开始，就是认识到对内识的需求，然后开展内识的进阶。上帝向世界发送的新讯息，给人类的新讯息，提供了内识的进阶。还有其他道路可走，但没有一条道路像这条道路一样清晰。</p>
<p>It is a gift of God. It is not a human invention. It is not a process that anyone made up. It does not represent an eclectic approach. It is something new, powerful and original. And it is here without any corruption. It has not been altered or manipulated, used by religious institutions or governments. It is pure—the Steps to Knowledge.</p>
<p>它是上帝的礼物。它不是人类的发明。它不是任何人编造的过程。它不代表折衷的方法。它是一种新的、强大的和原创的讯息。它在这里没有任何腐化。它没有被改变或操纵，它也没有被宗教机构或政府利用。它是纯粹的——内识的进阶。</p>
<p>You need to take these Steps now, for your life is important, but you do not have much time. Time is of the essence. Every day is important in determining whether you will prepare for the future or not, in determining your survivability in the future and the freedom of your mind. You do not have all the time in the world to think about it, for that time is wasted, and time is of the essence.</p>
<p>你需要现在就采取这些步骤，因为你的生命很重要，但你没有太多时间。时间至关重要。每一天都很重要，它决定了你是否为未来做好准备，决定了你未来的生存能力和你心灵的自由。你没有世界上所有的时间去思考它，因为这都是浪费时间，而时间至关重要。</p>
<p>Regarding the Great Waves of change and humanity’s recognition that Intervention is occurring from races from the Greater Community, humanity is very late in recognizing these things. There are very few people who can see any of this clearly at all. This has put the entire human family and civilization into great jeopardy, greater than you now realize.</p>
<p>关于变革的巨浪，以及人类对大社区种族正在实施干预的认识，人类对这些事情的认识非常迟钝。很少有人能够清楚地看到这一切。这让整个人类大家庭和文明陷入了巨大的危险之中，比你现在意识到的还要严重。</p>
<p>Therefore, the great need is not only your personal need for certainty, purpose, meaning, and direction. It is the need of humanity. You alone will not be able to meet the need of humanity, of course. But you are destined to play an important part in determining whether humanity will have the clarity and the strength and the will to face the great change that is coming and to [unite] in the face of the Greater Community to preserve human freedom and sovereignty within this world—a freedom and sovereignty that are now being challenged as never before.</p>
<p>因此，伟大的需求不仅仅是你个人对于确定性、目的、意义和方向的需求。它是人类的需求。当然，你独自一人将无法满足人类的需求。但是你注定要发挥重要作用，决定人类是否拥有清晰、力量和意志来面对正在到来的伟大变革，并在大社区面前团结起来，维护人类在这个世界上的自由和主权——这个自由和主权现在正受到前所未有的挑战。</p>
<p>You are meant to play a part in this. You cannot create that part. You cannot see that part at this moment, for you have not gotten that far up the mountain yet. But you need to take the journey of preparation that will take you there. For the only way to get up this mountain is to climb it, to take the steps. Nothing is going to lift you up to a vantage point where you can see the world clearly. You have to make this journey. There are no exceptions to this.</p>
<p>你注定要参与其中。你无法创造这个部分。你此刻无法看到这个部分，因为你还没有爬到山顶。但你需要踏上准备之旅，它将带你到达内识。因为攀登这座山的唯一方法就是攀登它，迈出脚步。没有什么能把你带到一个可以清楚地看到世界的观测位置。你必须踏上这段旅程。没有例外。</p>
<p>And you can see why this is the case because you must gain the strength, the commitment and the confidence to gain the power of Knowledge. It is not something that simply happens to you as if you were struck with a bolt of lightning. Even if the Angels appeared to you and told you what you must do, at this moment you do not have the strength to do it. You do not have the trust to do it. Your life is in disarray. You would have to alter your circumstances. You would have to rearrange your commitments and your obligations.</p>
<p>而你也会看到为什么要这样做，因为你必须获得力量、承诺和信心才能获得内识的力量。这不是像被闪电击中一样简单地发生在你身上的事情。即使天使出现在你面前，告诉你必须做什么，此时此刻你也没有力量去做。你没有足够的信任去做这件事。你的生命是一片混乱的。你必须改变你的处境。你必须重新安排你的承诺和义务。</p>
<p>In other words, you would have to take the Steps to Knowledge. There is no getting around this. From where you are at this moment, you cannot assume a greater life. And you will not have the power of Knowledge to protect you and to guide you because you are not aware of it sufficiently, and you do not trust it yet sufficiently.</p>
<p>换句话说，你必须开展内识进阶。这是无法回避的。从你此刻的处境来看，你无法设想一种更伟大的生命。你将无法拥有内识的力量来保护你、指引你，因为你还没有充分察觉到它，你还没有充分信任它。</p>
<p>That is why you must take the Steps to Knowledge. You do not have decades to do this. You do not have all the time in the world to be ambivalent in the face of this great need and challenge.</p>
<p>这就是为什么你必须开展内识的进阶。你没有几十年的时间来做这件事。你没有那么多的时间来面对这个伟大需求和挑战而犹豫不决。</p>
<p>Within you, you know this because you are uncomfortable. You are restless because there are things you must do that you are not doing. And there are things you are doing now that you need to stop doing. And you are restless. Your soul is restless because at the level of your soul, there is only being in the world and completing your mission. Your mind may want an endless list of things—pleasures and comforts and assurances and opportunities. But to your soul, it is all about fulfilling your mission here.</p>
<p>在你的内心深处，你知道这一点，因为你感到不舒服。你焦躁不安，因为有些事情你必须做，但你却没有做。有些事情你现在正在做，但你需要停止做。你焦躁不安。你的灵魂焦躁不安，因为在你的灵魂层面上，只有存在于这个世界上并完成你的使命。你的心灵可能想要一长串的东西——快乐、舒适、保证和机会。但对你的灵魂来说，这一切都是为了完成你在这里的使命。</p>
<p>Knowledge, then, is about fulfilling the need of the soul, for this is the most profound need within you. And as this need continues to go unmet, you are anxious, you are restless, you are upset, you are uncomfortable, you are agitated because at the very core of you, the great need is not being recognized and fulfilled.</p>
<p>那么，内识就是要满足灵魂的需求，因为这是你内心最深刻的需求。当这个需求持续得不到满足时，你就会焦虑、不安、心烦、不舒服、焦躁，因为在你的内心深处，这个伟大的需求没有得到认识和满足。</p>
<p>How could you have any equanimity if the need of the soul remains unrecognized and unfulfilled? How could your life have any stability? How could your thinking be coherent without this need being recognized and fulfilled?</p>
<p>如果灵魂的需求得不到认识和满足，你怎么能心平气静呢？你的生命怎么能稳定呢？如果这种需求得不到认识和满足，你的思维又怎么能连贯呢？</p>
<p>Most people are slaves to their social conditioning, to their fears, to their desires, to their religious prejudices. They cannot even think for themselves.</p>
<p>大多数人都是社会环境、恐惧、欲望和宗教偏见的奴隶。他们甚至无法独立思考。</p>
<p>Knowledge is the salvation, for only Knowledge has the power to liberate you from all of these things—from a bondage that is inevitable as a result of being in the world.</p>
<p>内识就是拯救，因为唯有内识才有力量将你从所有这些事情中解放出来——从存在于世间不可避免的束缚中解放出来。</p>
<p>That is why you must take the Steps to Knowledge. And God’s New Revelation for humanity provides the Steps to Knowledge. It is not the only pathway to Knowledge, but it is the pathway that God has given to prepare you for the Great Waves of change and for the reality of the Greater Community, and to prepare humanity for its future within a Greater Community of intelligent life.</p>
<p>正因为如此，你必须开展内识的进阶。上帝给人类的新启示提供了内识进阶。它不是通向内识的唯一道路，但它是上帝赋予你的道路，以便让你为变革的巨浪、为大社区的现实进行准备，让人类为它在智能生命大社区中的未来进行准备。</p>
<p>It is here that your inner life and your outer life really make the connection. The need of the soul and the events of the world are not disconnected. For indeed it is the world that will call out of you your greater purpose. It is recognizing where you are meant to be and what you are meant to serve and contribute to that will give so much definition and clarity and coherence to your greater work here.</p>
<p>正是在这里，你的内在生命和外在生命真正建立了联接。灵魂的需求和世界的事件并不是脱节的。因为事实上，正是世界将唤醒你的更伟大目的。正是认识到你注定要去哪里以及你注定要服务和贡献什么，将为你在此的更伟大工作提供如此多的明确性、清晰度和连贯性。</p>
<p>Very, very few people have found their greater work in the world. So do not think that by becoming an artist or a poet or a musician or some other wonderful activity that that will satisfy why you have come here. Those are popular notions with some people, but really your higher purpose is something else. You cannot define it. It is not grand and glorious. You will not be some hero or saint leading the masses to salvation. That is fantasy material. I am talking about reality. We are talking about reality.</p>
<p>极少有人在世界上找到更伟大的工作。所以不要认为成为一名艺术家、诗人、音乐家或其他一些美妙的活动就能满足你来到这里的原因。这些是一些人的流行观念，但实际上你的更高宗旨是别的。你无法定义它。它并不伟大和光荣。你不会成为带领大众获得拯救的英雄或圣人。那是幻想。我说的是现实。我们说的是现实。</p>
<p>Knowledge is the great power within you. It is seeking even at this moment to gain your attention. You are not paying attention, and that is why you are restless and disconcerted.</p>
<p>内识是你内在的伟大力量。它甚至在此刻也在寻求引起你的注意。你没有注意，这就是你焦躁不安和心烦意乱的原因。</p>
<p>Learning, then, to pay attention to Knowledge—developing stillness so that you can experience Knowledge, redirecting your mind and your concentration towards Knowledge, developing discernment and discretion in being in the world, refraining from attacking others, learning to comprehend Knowledge in others, recognizing those who are meant to be your true relationships from others who merely stimulate you—these represent only some of the great achievements that Knowledge will provide for you.</p>
<p>因此，学习关注内识——发展静止，这样你就能体验到内识，将你的心灵和你的专注转向内识，发展身处世界的辨别力和谨慎，避免攻击他人，学习理解他人身上的内识，识别那些注定是你真正关系的人和那些仅仅刺激你的人——这些只是内识将为你提供的一些伟大成就。</p>
<p>As We have said, Knowledge is not a human creation. It is a Divine Creation. It is through Knowledge that God will help you. You may pray and pray and pray for safety and for advantage, for protection for yourself or your loved ones, but it is through Knowledge that God can really help you because you need, even at this moment, the Wisdom of God as it relates to your life and your circumstances. You need the Wisdom of God as it relates to what you need to do and to be, and to the change you must bring about in your own affairs in the world to make it possible to move towards a greater life.</p>
<p>正如我们所说，内识并非人类的创造。它是一种神圣的创造。正是通过内识，上帝将帮助你。你可以不断祈祷，祈求安全和利益，祈求保护你自己或你所爱的人，但正是通过内识，上帝才能真正帮助你，因为即使在此刻，你也需要上帝的智慧，因为它与你的生命和你的境遇相关。你需要上帝的智慧，因为它与你需要做什么和成为什么相关，与你必须在世界上的自身事务中带来的改变相关，从而有可能走向更伟大的生命。</p>
<p>This is how God is going to help you. God of the entire universe is not preoccupied with human affairs. God is not following you around like a handmaiden, like a servant, like some kind of errand boy to fulfill your wandering desires.</p>
<p>这就是上帝帮助你的方式。整个宇宙的上帝并不关心人类的事务。上帝不会像一位侍女、一位仆人或一位差使那样跟随你，满足你四处游荡的欲望。</p>
<p>God has placed Wisdom within you to guide and to protect you and to give you the strength and the wisdom to find your way so that you may assume a greater role in life and provide a greater service to humanity.</p>
<p>上帝将智慧放置在你的内在，来指导和保护你，并赋予你力量和智慧来找到你的道路，这样你就能在生命中承担起一个更伟大角色，并为人类提供一种更伟大服务。</p>
<p>People often ask: “Well, is this about intuition?” And We say intuition is not great enough to encompass what Knowledge is and what Knowledge can do through you. Intuition is fleeting experiences of inner certainty and sometimes precognition of events, but Knowledge is so much greater. You really cannot compare them adequately. Perhaps you could say that intuition is the early fleeting experiences of Knowledge. But what Knowledge is meant to be in your life is far greater. For it is a presence. It is a power. It is an awareness. It is a capacity. It is a love at a very different level than what people think of as love. It defies human definition.</p>
<p>人们经常问：“好吧，这是关于直觉吗？”我们说直觉并不足以涵盖内识是什么以及内识能通过你做什么。直觉是内在确定性的短暂体验，有时是对事件的预知，但内识要伟大得多。你真的无法充分比较它们。或许你可以说直觉是内识早期的短暂体验。但内识在你的生命中的意义要伟大得多。因为它是一种存在。它是一种力量。它是一种觉知。它是一种能力。它是一种与人们所认为的爱截然不同层次的爱。它违背了人类的定义。</p>
<p>If you try to understand it with your intellect, it will always be beyond your comprehension. If you try to make it concrete and simple, it will escape your experience. If you try to grab onto it and use it for your own personal advantage, it will slip through your fingers.</p>
<p>如果你试图用你的智力去理解它，它总是超出你的理解范围。如果你试图使它具体而简单，它将逃离你的经验。如果你试图抓住它并用它来为你自身谋取私利，它就会从你的指尖溜走。</p>
<p>For you were meant to serve Knowledge, for Knowledge is who you are and why you are here. But that is not how you think of yourself at this moment. This is not the awareness that you have yet, so you must take the Steps to Knowledge to prepare yourself for a future that will be unlike the past, to prepare yourself for the Great Waves of change, to prepare yourself to deal with the Intervention from the Greater Community, to prepare yourself to find those individuals who are destined to help you and to assist you.</p>
<p>因为你注定要服务内识，因为内识就是你是谁以及你为何在此。但这并不是你此刻对你自己的看法。这不是你目前拥有的觉知，所以你必须开展内识进阶，让你自己为一个不同于过去的未来做好准备，让你自己为变革的巨浪做好准备，让你自己为应对来自大社区的干预做好准备，让你自己为找到那些注定要帮助你和协助你的个体做好准备。</p>
<p>You need Knowledge just to be safe in a world that will be far more dangerous in the future. You need Knowledge to have the certainty to live with strength and purpose under very uncertain circumstances. You need Knowledge to rise above the growing conflict and anxiety that will be occurring all around you as people become overwhelmed by the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>你需要内识，才能在未来更加危险的世界中保持安全。你需要内识，才能在非常不确定的情况下坚定地、有目的地生活。你需要内识，才能超越人们被变革巨浪淹没时在你周围发生的不断加剧的冲突和焦虑。</p>
<p>Really, who you are and what you can do must be revealed to you. You cannot figure it out with your ideas. For your life is mysterious, is it not? Beneath the struggle of your mind to understand and to comprehend and to control and to determine events, underneath that surface and awareness and intelligence, there is a greater mystery of your life—who you are, where you have come from, what you are meant to do, where you will go beyond this world. This is the realm of Knowledge.</p>
<p>实际上，你是谁，你必须做什么，必须由你来揭示。你无法用你的想法去理解它。因为你的生命是神秘的，不是吗？在你的心灵挣扎着去理解、去领悟、去控制、去决定事件的表面之下，在你的觉知和智能之下，还有一个更伟大的生命之谜——你是谁、你来自哪里、你注定要做什么、你将超越这个世界去往何处。这就是内识的领域。</p>
<p>Save yourself a great deal of time and foolish attempts by not trying to understand it intellectually. It is an experience you must have. It is an experience you have already had, in little ways.</p>
<p>不要试图从理性的角度去理解它，这样可以为你自己节省大量的时间和愚蠢的尝试。这是你必须拥有的经历。这是你已经有过的体验，在一些小的方面。</p>
<p>That is why you are searching for purpose and meaning in your relationships, in your work, in your activities, because you are feeling the need of the soul. You are not satisfied with little things. You need more things. You need greater things. You need a breakthrough. And as the world grows more difficult in the face of the Great Waves of change, you need strength and certainty and courage—all coming from the need of the soul, you see? Not merely a psychological need, it is a need of the soul.</p>
<p>这就是为什么你在人际关系中、工作中、活动中寻找目的和意义，因为你感受到了灵魂的需求。你不满足于小事。你需要更多的东西。你需要更伟大的内识。你需要突破。而当世界在变革巨浪面前变得更加艰难时，你需要力量、确定性和勇气——所有这些都来自灵魂的需求，你明白吗？这不仅仅是一种心理需求，它是一种灵魂的需求。</p>
<p>Therefore, recognize what a great revelation this is for you—that God has given you the power and the strength of Knowledge, hidden deeply within you where you yourself cannot find it. And God has given you the Steps to Knowledge so that Knowledge can emerge within you naturally and appropriately and that you can build the strength to be a vehicle for Knowledge, to build a foundation in your life for Knowledge, to surround yourself with people who can support the emergence of Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>因此，认识到这对你来说是一个多么伟大的启示——上帝赋予你内识的力量和强度，它深深地隐藏在你的内在，你自己无法找到它。上帝赋予你内识的进阶，这样内识就能自然而恰当地在你内在呈现，这样你就能构建力量，成为内识的一个载体，在你的生命中为内识建立一个基础，让你的周围都是能够支持你内在内识呈现的人。</p>
<p>You can perhaps begin to see the need and the problem, but the solution must be revealed to you. For you must understand that God is not going to come and rescue humanity in the 11th hour from the Great Waves of change or from the Intervention that is occurring in the world today. No.</p>
<p>你或许开始看到需求和问题，但解决方案必须向你揭示。因为你必理解，上帝不会在最后一刻来拯救人类，让他们摆脱当今世界正在发生的变革巨浪或干预。不会的。</p>
<p>God has placed Knowledge within every person in the world. If even a small number of these people can gain the strength of Knowledge, they will have the power to turn the course of humanity and to provide for humanity, and you are meant to be amongst this number. That is why you cannot be too concerned with others who will not see and cannot see, who will not know and cannot know. You must attend to your own experience and preparation.</p>
<p>上帝已经把内识放置在世界上每个人的内心。如果这些人中哪怕只有一小部分能够获得内识的力量，他们就将拥有扭转人类进程、为人类提供帮助的力量，而你注定是其中一员。正因为如此，你不能太在意那些不愿看到和无法看到、不愿知道和无法知道的人。你必须关注你自身的经验和准备。</p>
<p>That is the calling for you now. That is the next step for you now. Accept that you do not have an answer regarding who you are and why you are here. Accept you do not have an answer about how you are going to deal with the Great Waves of change or with the Intervention. If you have the humility to do this, then you can begin to put yourself in a position to receive what God has intended for you.</p>
<p>这就是现在对你的召唤。这就是你现在的下一步。接受你不知道你是谁、你为什么在这里的答案。接受你不知道如何应对变革的巨浪或干预的答案。如果你有谦逊之心去做这件事，那么你就可以开始让你自己处于一个可以接受上帝对你意志的位置。</p>
<p>Begin to take the Steps to Knowledge, to prepare your mind and your life so that Knowledge can emerge within you, which it will do naturally. Once you create the environment for it and the desire for it and the capacity for it, it will arise naturally.</p>
<p>开始开展内识的进阶，准备好你的心灵和你的生命，这样内识就能在你内在浮现，这是自然而然的。一旦你为它创造了环境、对它的渴望和对它的能力，它就会自然而然地出现。</p>
<p>It has been trying to arise within you all along, but your mind is somewhere else, your concerns are somewhere else, your energy is being devoted somewhere else. You are preoccupied. You are self-obsessed. You are governed by your social conditioning. And so all the messages that Knowledge is sending you every day are missed. You are not hearing the cues. You are not seeing the signs. You are not responding.</p>
<p>它一直试图在你的内心升起，但你的心灵在别处，你的担忧在别处，你的能量也用在别处。你心事重重。你沉迷于自我。你被你的社会条件所支配。因此，你错过了内识每天向你发送的所有讯息。你听不到暗示。你看不到迹象。你没有做出回应。</p>
<p>Therefore, to begin to make this great transition to being an inner-directed person instead of being an outer-directed person requires that you take the Steps to Knowledge, and this takes time. This does not happen overnight or within a month or two. This takes time, for it is a journey.</p>
<p>因此，要开始这个伟大的转变，成为一个内在主导的人，而不是一个外在主导的人，你需要开展内识的进阶，而这需要时间。这不会在一夜之间或一两个月内发生。这需要时间，因为这是一段旅程。</p>
<p>You cannot run up this mountain. This is not some kind of frolic. It is a big mountain, and you must make the journey. And as you make the journey, well, you begin to set aside things that are not necessary or that are weighing you down or that are too heavy to carry.</p>
<p>你不能跑上这座山。这不是什么嬉戏。它是一座大山，你必须踏上旅程。当你踏上旅程时，你就会开始放下那些不必要的东西、那些让你感到沉重的东西或那些难以承受的东西。</p>
<p>As you proceed, others join you in your journey, and you realize that you are not traveling alone and that you need their support and encouragement, for you are still down on the lower parts of the mountain, surrounded by the forest. You cannot see where you are. You cannot see where you are going. You cannot see your goal.</p>
<p>当你继续前行时，其他人会加入你的旅程，你会意识到你并不是一个人在旅行，你需要他们的支持和鼓励，因为你仍然在山下，被森林包围着。你看不到你身在何处。你看不到你要去哪里。你看不到你的目标。</p>
<p>You are acting on faith, and real faith is based on the power of Knowledge encouraging you. It is a conviction that you must proceed; you must continue. At the moment, you will not know what you are doing, you will not know why you are doing it, it will seem to be a crazy endeavor, but it is absolutely the right thing for you.</p>
<p>你凭着信念行事，而真正的信仰是建立在内识的力量鼓励你的基础之上的。这是一种你必须前进的信念；你必须坚持下去。此时此刻，你不知道你在做什么，不知道你为什么要这样做，这似乎是一个疯狂的尝试，但这对你来说绝对是正确的事情。</p>
<p>This is the journey. This is where you build the inner capacity for Knowledge. This is where you acquire the wisdom you will need to be able to carry Knowledge and to express what Knowledge has given you to provide for others. This is where you mature as a person, and you gain your greater strength and your greater abilities.</p>
<p>这就是旅程。这就是你建立内识的内在容量的地方。这就是你获得智慧的地方，你将能够承载内识，并表达内识赋予你的礼物，以便为他人提供帮助。这就是你作为一个人成熟的地方，你将获得更伟大的力量和更伟大的能力。</p>
<p>Therefore, you begin by recognizing the need and then you take the journey of preparation. It is the journey of preparation that will begin to shift your life and to renew you and to strengthen you and to give you the awareness that your life is greater than what you experience in this world and that greatness is with you now and that you have a destiny in being here, a destiny that perhaps you have only rarely experienced, if at all.</p>
<p>因此，你首先要认识到这种需求，然后踏上准备之旅。准备之旅将开始改变你的生命，让你焕然一新，让你强大，让你觉知你的生命比你在这个世界上所经历的更伟大，伟大现在就在你身边，你在这里有一个天命，一个你也许很少体验到的天命，如果有的话。</p>
<p>Then you take this journey, and it begins to reveal things to you along the way. You begin to see things and feel things and know things that other people are not feeling, seeing and knowing. You begin to recognize certain things you never saw before, but which were always there.</p>
<p>然后你踏上这段旅程，一路上它会开始向你揭示一些事情。你开始看到、感受到和知道他人没有感受到、看到和知道的事情。你开始认识到你从未见过但一直存在的内识。</p>
<p>You begin to hear the need of the soul in others. Instead of just criticizing them or condemning them outright, you begin to hear the need of the soul within them.</p>
<p>你开始听到他人灵魂的需求。你开始倾听他人内心灵魂的需求，而不是一味地批评他们或直截了当地谴责他们。</p>
<p>You begin to have the courage and the need to face the Great Waves of change instead of denying them or running away from them. And you begin to realize that humanity is standing at the threshold of space, and it is not alone in the universe or even within its own world.</p>
<p>你开始有勇气、有必要面对变革的巨浪，而不是否认它们或逃避它们。你开始意识到，人类正站在太空的门槛上，在宇宙中，甚至在你自身的世界里，人类并不孤单。</p>
<p>As you make progress up this mountain, taking the Steps to Knowledge, you begin to have personal revelations. As your mind is less preoccupied with its hopeless pursuits and its unhealthy relationships, it frees up tremendous energy for you. And with this liberated energy, you regain your strength. You regain your composure. You regain competence and confidence. And you gain the strength to make the journey—strength you were not sure you had at the outset, but strength you are now experiencing.</p>
<p>随着你不断攀登这座大山，开展内识进阶，你开始获得个人的启示。当你的心灵不再专注于绝望的追求和不健康的关系时，它会为你释放出巨大的能量。凭借这种释放的能量，你重新获得了力量。你重新获得了镇定。你重新获得了能力和信心。你获得了踏上旅程的力量——这种力量你一开始并不确定，但现在你正在体验它。</p>
<p>For every step you take up this mountain will give you greater clarity, greater certainty and will break the hold of weakness upon you. You will become stronger within yourself and more certain, but always recognizing the power of the Mystery within you—which is feeding you now, which is encouraging you now, which is giving you strength and perseverance, confidence and patience.</p>
<p>你在这座山上迈出的每一步都会给你带来更大的清晰度、更大的确定性，并打破软弱对你的控制。你的内心会变得更强大，更确定，但要始终认识到你内心的神秘力量——它现在正在滋养你，它现在正在鼓励你，它正在给你力量和毅力、信心和耐心。</p>
<p>Therefore, you will become strong and humble all at once, for you recognize that the greater power is not your own and that it is feeding you and serving you as you are learning to serve the greater purpose that has brought you into the world.</p>
<p>因此，你会立刻变得强大和谦逊，因为你认识到更伟大的力量不属于你自身，它正在滋养你、服务你，因为你正在学习服务于把你带到这个世界的更伟大目的。</p>
