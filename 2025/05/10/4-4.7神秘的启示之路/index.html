<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on February 18, 2009 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2009 年 2 月 18 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People are impatient. They want answers now. They want certainty now. They want the end results now. And of course they do not get these things, so they are disappointed and suspicious. They do not understand the nature of preparation.</p>
<p>人们缺乏耐心。他们现在就想要答案。他们现在就想要确定性。他们现在就想要最终结果。当然，他们得不到这些，所以他们感到失望和怀疑。他们不理解准备的本质。</p>
<p>Great insights, greater relationships, remarkable opportunities, personal revelations—these things come as the result of preparation. They do not just come. They come when a person has developed an awareness and a capacity for a greater responsibility to be given to them. They are largely the product of a person’s preparation. And during your time of preparation, it is very hard to be sure of the outcome. Sometimes you do not even know what you are preparing for. You just know you must prepare.</p>
<p>伟大的洞见、更伟大的关系、非凡的机遇、个人的启示——这些都是准备的结果。它们并非凭空而来。当一个人发展出一种觉知和能力去承担赋予他们的更伟大责任时，它们就会到来。它们很大程度上是一个人准备的产物。而在准备的过程中，很难确定结果。有时你甚至不知道你在为何而准备。你只是知道你必须准备。</p>
<p>So it requires great trust, great faith in the power and presence of Knowledge within yourself, the deeper Intelligence that God has placed within you, and great faith in Knowledge in others.</p>
<p>因此它需要伟大的信任，对你自己内在内识的力量和存在、上帝置于你内在的更深层次智能的伟大信仰，以及对他人内识的伟大信仰。</p>
<p>This faith is necessary, but it must be tempered with wisdom. For there are many things holding you back. And there are many things holding others back, particularly those who are destined to play a greater role in your life. So while you are preparing, there seems to be no assurance of the outcome.</p>
<p>这种信仰必不可少，但必须以智慧来调和。因为有许多事情阻碍着你。也有许多事情阻碍着他人，尤其是那些注定要在你的生命中扮演更重要角色的人。所以，当你在准备的时候，似乎并不确定结果会如何。</p>
<p>This is true for so many things that are of prime importance to your life. It is not like working your way through college. If you take all of the required courses, you get the certificate at the end. This is not like that, you see.</p>
<p>很多对你生命至关重要的事情都是如此。它不像靠打工挣钱读大学。如果你修完了所有必修课程，最后就能拿到证书。但事实并非如此，你看。</p>
<p>You develop your connection to Knowledge with an understanding that it will strengthen your life and enable you to be aware of what you really need and what is holding you back. But you do not know what Knowledge will bring. You do not know [what] this is going to look like, or when the moment will strike, when you are [ready] to receive something of great importance.</p>
<p>你带着这样的理解发展你与内识的联接：它将强化你的生命，并使你能够觉知你真正需要什么，以及什么在阻碍你。但你不知道内识会带来什么。你不知道这将是什么样子，也不知道那个时刻何时降临，何时你准备好接收某种极其重要的东西。</p>
<p>So for those who are impatient, they want the assurance of the outcome first. And, of course, there is no real assurance of the outcome. So they will not prepare and cultivate their abilities and develop their skills. They rely upon others’ wisdom and others’ productivity to provide these things for them.</p>
<p>所以对于那些缺乏耐心的人来说，他们首先想要的是结果的保证。当然，结果并没有真正的保证。所以他们不会做好准备，培养他们的能力，发展他们的技能。他们依赖别人的智慧和生产力来提供这些东西。</p>
<p>They are impatient. They are insecure. They do not understand the process of revelation within themselves. And even if they do begin to prepare, they are constantly looking for the results, and they try to speed up the process or change the process. And, of course, the more they try to control their inner development, the more its greater power eludes them, and the further they place themselves from the real results the true inner preparation will create—learning something you do not know, developing skills you do not have, cultivating wisdom and discernment and discretion.</p>
<p>他们缺乏耐心。他们缺乏安全感。他们不理解他们自己内在启示的过程。即便他们开始准备，他们也不断寻求结果，并试图加速这个过程或改变这个过程。当然，他们越试图控制他们的内在发展，它更伟大的力量就越远离他们，他们就越远离真正的内在准备将创造的真正结果——学习你不知道的东西，发展你不具备的技能，培养智慧、辨识力和审慎力。</p>
<p>These are not things you learn by just reading a book or taking a course somewhere. These are skills you cultivate throughout your life; you cultivate in every situation. They bring you results that are both immediate and long lasting.</p>
<p>这些技能并非仅仅通过读书或参加课程就能学到。这些技能需要你终生培养，在各种情况下都能得到锻炼。它们能为你带来立竿见影的效果，也能带来持久的回报。</p>
<p>But you do not do this for a simple definable goal. People do not learn to become wise to become wise because they do not even know what being wise really is, or what it will be like, or what it will require of them, and how much they will have to work for it, and how much they will have to set aside to achieve it.</p>
<p>但你这样做并非为了一个简单的、可定义的目标。人们之所以没有学习变得明智，是因为他们甚至不知道明智的真正含义，它将会是什么样的，它需要他们做什么，需要付出多少努力，需要拨出多少才能实现它。</p>
<p>Now you are going beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect in cultivating these deeper skills. Perhaps you have an idea of what you want to achieve. Perhaps you recognize the value of your efforts. But how this process will unfold, what it will reveal, and when this revelation will occur is beyond your ability to determine.</p>
<p>现在，你在培养这些更深层次的技能时，正在超越智力的范畴和范围。或许你对你想要实现的目标有所构想。或许你认识到你努力的价值。但这个过程将如何展开，它将揭示什么，以及这个启示何时发生，都超出了你的判断能力。</p>
<p>When We speak of a person’s revelation, We are talking about engaging with forces far beyond your own awareness and even far beyond yourself. Even if you have a wise teacher who is guiding you, even this teacher cannot tell when and how this revelation will take place.</p>
<p>当我们谈到一个人的启示时，我们指的是与远远超出你自身的觉知，甚至远远超出你自身的力量进行接触。即使你有一位明智的导师指导你，即使是这位导师也无法预知这启示何时、如何发生。</p>
<p>It is mysterious by its very nature because it is engaging with powers within and beyond the world, within and beyond the individual. You are engaging in a process that is creating a fundamental shift within the individual and aligning this individual not only with their ideas, but with Greater Powers in the universe. That is why you cannot really be the judge of your progress, for this is a long journey and a great mountain to climb.</p>
<p>它本质上是神秘的，因为它在与世界之内和之外、个体之内和之外的力量互动。你正在参与一个过程，这个过程正在创造个体内在的一个根本性转变，并使这个个体不仅与他们的想法相协调，而且与宇宙中更伟大的力量相协调。正因为如此，你无法真正评判你的进步，因为这是一个漫长的旅程，一座需要攀登的高山。</p>
<p>At any point in the journey, you can feel that it is hopeless. You are making no progress. You are just like how you used to be. And the journey goes on, and you lose heart, and you think: “Well, is it really worth it after all? Why am I doing this? I could be building a career. I could be gaining wealth. I could be attracting a partner. Why am I doing this?” You are doing this because Knowledge within you is moving you to do this.</p>
<p>在旅程的任何节点，你都会感到绝望。你没有取得任何进展。你和以前一样。旅程继续，你灰心丧气，你想：“好吧，这真的值得吗？我为什么要这样做？我本可以建立一份事业。我本可以积累财富。我本可以吸引一位伴侣。我为什么要这样做？”你这样做是因为你内在的内识在引导你这样做。</p>
<p>And what is Knowledge, after all, this mysterious power? “Why can’t I harness it and use it to get what I need and what I want?” Because Knowledge is greater than the intellect, and it is pure, and you cannot use it as a resource.</p>
<p>那么，内识，这股神秘的力量，究竟是什么呢？“为什么我不能驾驭它，用它来得到我需要的和我想要的呢？”因为内识比智力更伟大，它是纯粹的，你不能把它当作一种资源。</p>
<p>Now you are engaging in Divine Powers. Now you are reaching beyond human logic and reason. Now you are going beyond simply setting goals for yourself.</p>
<p>现在，你正在参与神圣的力量。现在，你正在超越人类的逻辑和理性。现在，你正在超越简单地为你自己设定目标。</p>
<p>All the great events in your life that are truly great, not simply personal achievements that you plot for yourself, but the really great things—the great relationships that will come to you, the great insights, the great turning points, the great thresholds—you cannot predict these things. They are not just the product of will power. They are a product of a deeper union within yourself, a deeper connection with your purpose and your destiny, with those who sent you into the world, and with those who will be waiting to receive you when you leave this place.</p>
<p>你生命中所有真正伟大的事件，并非仅仅是你为你自己规划的个人成就，而是真正伟大的事情——那些将降临到你身上的伟大关系，伟大的洞见，伟大的转折点，伟大的门槛——你无法预测这些事情。它们不仅仅是意志力的产物。它们是你内在一种更深层次联合的产物，一种与你的目的和你的天命的更深层次联接的产物，与那些将你送入世界的存在的更深层次联接的产物，与那些在你离开这个世界时等待着接纳你的存在的更深层次联接的产物。</p>
<p>Here you must be both practical on the outside and able to follow the Mystery on the inside. You must take care of your affairs, your finances, your responsibilities, your necessary obligations while you are following something that is inexplicable that you cannot predict or control.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须外在务实，内在追随神秘。你必须照顾好你的事务、你的财务、你的责任、你的必要义务，同时追随某种你无法预测或控制的、无法解释的内识。</p>
<p>You cannot give yourself over to the Mystery because you still have to manage yourself in the world. You have responsibilities. You have schedules. You have needs. You have made agreements with others, some of which need to be honored.</p>
<p>你不能把你自己交给神秘，因为你仍然需要在这个世界里管理你自己。你有责任。你有日程安排。你有需求。你与他人达成了协议，其中一些需要遵守。</p>
<p>You are living in two realities now—the reality of manifestation and the reality of the Mystery—and you are doing this all at once, you see. So while you work hard and are responsible on the outside to maintain stability in your life and to keep the outside from overtaking you or undermining your progress, you are following a path that is essentially mysterious.</p>
<p>你现在生活在两个现实之中——显化的现实和神秘的现实——而且你同时在做着这一切，你瞧。所以，当你努力工作，在外在负责地维持你生活的稳定，并阻止外在超越你或破坏你的进步时，你正在追随一条本质上神秘的道路。</p>
<p>You are participating because you know you must participate. And you are giving yourself to your preparation because it is clear to you that you must do this. That is the only justification you really have or really need.</p>
<p>你参与是因为你知道你必须参与。你全身心投入准备，是因为你很清楚你必须这么做。这是你真正拥有或真正需要的唯一理由。</p>
<p>Here when you have the feeling that you must do this or start doing that, you have to pay attention. This is important. Knowledge is guiding you along the way. It is pulling you back from going off track. It is restraining you from making difficult and costly mistakes. It is restraining you from giving your life away to people or to activities that are not part of your greater mission and purpose here.</p>
<p>在这里，当你感到你必须做这件事或开始做那件事时，你必须注意。这很重要。内识一路指引着你。它把你拉回来，避免偏离轨道。它阻止你犯下艰难且代价高昂的错误。它阻止你把你的生命交给那些不属于你在此更伟大使命和目的的人或活动。</p>
<p>Do not think you can understand this philosophically or metaphysically, that you really understand all the levels you will have to go through. This deceives people. People think they can understand what they really cannot understand. This requires a kind of participation that is guided by Knowledge, not by your ideology.</p>
<p>不要认为你能从哲学或形而上学的角度理解这一点，不要认为你真正理解了你必须经历的所有层面。这会欺骗人们。人们认为他们能够理解他们实际上无法理解的事情。这需要一种由内识而非你的意识形态引导的参与。</p>
<p>Here you recognize there are greater powers in your life and greater responsibilities to assume. This will always keep you humble because you realize that this whole process has been created for you by Powers beyond you: beyond the world, beyond the universe.</p>
<p>在这里，你认识到你的生命中蕴藏着更伟大的力量，也肩负着更伟大的责任。这将使你永远保持谦逊，因为你意识到这整个过程是由超越你、超越世界、超越宇宙的力量为你创造的。</p>
<p>They are guiding you through a maze—freeing you from your own limitations; freeing you from your own weaknesses; freeing you from your dangerous and unwarranted participation with others along the way—while you are gaining strength, gaining insight, developing wisdom, strengthening your experience of Knowledge, responding to its encouragements and to its restraints, heeding its warnings and its guidance.</p>
<p>他们引导你穿越迷宫——将你从你自身的局限中解放出来；将你从你自身的弱点中解放出来；将你从沿途与他人的危险和不必要的参与中解放出来——同时你正在获得力量，获得洞察力，发展智慧，强化你对内识的体验，回应它的鼓励和它的限制，留意它的警告和它的指引。</p>
<p>You are learning to do this to separate this from the machinations of your own mind, the deceptions of your mind—your social conditioning, your defense mechanisms, and your own self-deception.</p>
<p>您正在学习这样做，以便将其与你自身心灵的阴谋、你心灵的欺骗——你的社会条件、你的防御机制以及你自身的自欺欺人区分开来。</p>
<p>You could not create a plan that could do all of these things. You could not mastermind a process that could free you and enlighten you at the same time. You do not have the range of experience. You do not know where you are going. It is uncharted territory. It is not a rational process. It is not a philosophical pursuit.</p>
<p>你不可能制定一个能做到所有这些事情的计划。你不可能策划一个既能解放你又能启迪你的过程。你缺乏丰富的经验。你不知道你要去哪里。这是一个未知的领域。它不是一个理性的过程。它不是一项哲学追求。</p>
<p>When you begin the study of Steps to Knowledge, you have an idea of why it is important. Perhaps you have an idea that there is a greater Mind within you, and you are going to connect to it, and it is going to make your life so much better that it has been. That is fine and perhaps even necessary, but beyond that, your ability to participate, your motivation and the process itself will be beyond your understanding.</p>
<p>当你开始学习内识进阶时，你会明白它为何重要。或许你会明白，你内在有一个更伟大的心灵，你将与之连接，它将使你的生命比以往更加美好。这很好，甚至可能是必要的，但除此之外，你的参与能力、你的动力以及这个过程本身都将超越你的理解。</p>
<p>Steps to Knowledge will teach you how to think in resonance and alignment with Knowledge. But beyond this, it is building the connection to Knowledge itself, which begins to open inner doors within your mind. It is setting in motion various processes of change that will affect your inner and your outer life.</p>
<p>内识进阶将教导你如何与内识产生共鸣和协调地思考。但除此之外，它还在构建与内识本身的联接，这开始打开你心灵的内在大门。它正在启动各种改变的过程，这些改变将影响你的内在生命和外在生命。</p>
<p>You cannot predict and foresee these things. You cannot be in control because you do not know the territory you are entering into. You do not possess the skills that this will bring to you. You do not know how this learning and this unlearning will take place.</p>
<p>你无法预测和预见这些事情。你无法掌控，因为你不知道你正在进入的领域。你不具备这将带给你的技能。你不知道这种学习和忘却将如何发生。</p>
<p>Here you must be very patient and persevering. When you are climbing a great mountain, you do not stop every ten paces and ask yourself: “Am I there yet?” You just keep going, each step taking you higher, each step taking you further.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须非常有耐心，并且坚持不懈。当你攀登一座高山时，你不会每走十步就停下来问你自己：“我到了吗？”你只会继续前进，每一步都让你更高，每一步都让你更远。</p>
<p>It is a journey you have never made before, so you do not know what it will require, or how many turns and twists of the road there will be, and how many seductions and attractions there will be along the way to pull you off this pathway.</p>
<p>它是一段你从未经历过的旅程，所以你不知道它需要什么，也不知道路上会有多少曲折，也不知道沿途会有多少诱惑和吸引将你拉离这条道路。</p>
<p>You will want financial security. You will want love and romance. You will want social recognition. So many things will be there along the way calling you away, pulling you away. And that is part of the journey, you see.</p>
<p>你会渴望经济保障。你会渴望爱情和浪漫。你会渴望社会认可。一路上会有太多东西在召唤你，把你拉走。而这正是人生旅程的一部分，你看。</p>
<p>If you recognize these attractions and do not capitulate to them, Knowledge will become stronger within you. It will become such a strong force that it will overtake your decisions, and you will be very clear what to do. This clarity will not be an imposition upon you. It will be coming from the very depths of your being.</p>
<p>如果你认识到这些诱惑，并且不向它们屈服，内识就会在你内在变得更强大。它将成为一股如此强大的力量，以至于它将超越你的决定，你将非常清楚该做什么。这种明晰并非强加于你。它将来自你存在最深处。</p>
<p>If you are going to undertake this journey, it is so very important to continue and go the whole way because as you travel on, bridges will be burning behind you. Your values will be changing. Your priorities will be shifting. Now you are seeking quiet more than stimulation. You are seeking honesty with others more than beauty and attraction. You are seeking true union with others rather than simply having recreational experiences with them. Your pursuit will become more honest, more sincere, more authentic and more true to your real nature.</p>
<p>如果你要踏上这段旅程，坚持下去并走完全程至关重要，因为随着你的旅程不断前行，你身后的桥梁将会被烧毁。你的价值观将会改变。你的优先事项将会转移。现在，你寻求的更多的是宁静而非刺激。你寻求的更多的是与他人坦诚相待而非美丽和吸引力。你寻求的是与他人真正的合一，而非仅仅与他们一起享受娱乐体验。你的追求将变得更加诚实、更加真诚、更加真实，也更加忠于你的本性。</p>
<p>At a certain point, you will see you cannot go back to living a trivial life with trivial pursuits, with trivial interests, with trivial conversations with other people. That is why you must go forward, into the unknown, beyond where you have been.</p>
<p>到了某个时刻，你会看到，你无法再回到那种琐碎的生活，那种追求琐碎，兴趣琐碎，与人闲聊琐碎的日子。正因如此，你必须继续前行，探索未知，超越你曾经的处境。</p>
<p>You cannot go back because there is nothing behind you that is of real value any more. You cannot go back and resurrect an old life and try to be happy and secure in it because you will know better. You cannot undo the wisdom that you have created. You cannot now hide the truth that has been revealed to you as you have gone along.</p>
<p>你无法回头，因为你身后已不再有任何真正有价值的事物。你无法回到过去，重新开启过去的生命，并试图在其中获得快乐和安全，因为你终将拥有更深刻的知道。你无法抹去你所创造的智慧。你无法隐藏在你前进的道路上逐渐显露的真理。</p>
<p>There is no turning back, really, without putting yourself in incredible conflict and suffering. You must keep going. You must reach that goal, whatever it is. You must climb this mountain, whatever it is. You must follow this guidance where it is meant to take you.</p>
<p>真的，没有回头路可走，除非你置身于难以置信的冲突和痛苦之中。你必须坚持下去。你必须达成目标，无论它是什么。你必须攀登这座山，无论它是什么。你必须遵循这条指引，去往它注定要带你去的地方。</p>
<p>All the great saints, all the great contributors to humanity, have had to travel a journey like this, a journey that is not mapped out in your educational institutions or universities, an education that is mysterious and profound and essential.</p>
<p>所有伟大的圣人，所有对人类做出伟大贡献的人，都必须经历这样的旅程，这是你们的教育机构或大学没有规划好的旅程，这是一次神秘、深奥且至关重要的教育。</p>
<p>Sooner or later, everyone will come to their senses and will begin to realize that they are suffering and that they need to undo the causes of their suffering. But this decision could be far into the future.</p>
<p>每个人迟早都会醒悟过来，开始意识到他们正在遭受痛苦，并且需要消除造成痛苦的根源。但这个决定可能还得等很久以后。</p>
<p>For you, you must honor this decision now or you would not be reading these words or hearing this message. You would still be lost in the world—running around, constantly busy, constantly stimulated, avoiding yourself, avoiding others, avoiding your deeper experience, avoiding your deeper feelings, running around slavishly, driven.</p>
<p>对你来说，你现在必须尊重这个决定，否则你就不会读到这些文字，也不会听到这个讯息。你仍然会迷失在这个世界里——四处奔波，不断忙碌，不断受到刺激，逃避你自己，逃避他人，逃避你更深层次的体验，逃避你更深层次的感受，奴性地四处奔波，被驱使。</p>
<p>But that is not you now, for you are in a process of choosing a different pathway—a pathway not of your own making, a reality you are not trying to create for yourself, but a great pathway, the greatest of all, the heart of every religion, the soul’s pursuit, the most essential education.</p>
<p>但现在那不是你，因为你正在选择一条不同的道路——一条不是你自己创造的道路，一个你不是试图为你自己创造的现实，而是一条伟大的道路，最伟大的道路，每一种宗教的核心，灵魂的追求，最重要的教育。</p>
<p>You have to be smart and practical on the outside or the world around you will undermine your journey and pull you off your pathway. You manage your outer affairs so the inner revelation can continue.</p>
<p>你必须在外在表现得聪明务实，否则周围的世界会阻碍你的旅程，让你偏离正轨。你管理好外在的事务，才能让内在的启示得以延续。</p>
<p>Knowledge is taking you somewhere. It is taking you out of one life and into another life. It is exposing your weaknesses and giving you the strength to choose again. It is building your strengths and giving you every opportunity to exercise them on your own behalf and for the well-being of others.</p>
<p>内识会带你去往特定的地方。它会带你走出一种生命，走向另一种生命。它会揭露你的弱点，并赋予你再次选择的力量。它会构建你的优势，并给予你充分的机会去运用这些优势，为了你自己，也为了他人的福祉。</p>
<p>You go through this process, learning along the way, assuming nothing. Forget your notions of enlightenment. Forget your notions of becoming a saint. Forget all these romantic ideals you have about spirituality. For that is not what this journey will be like at all.</p>
<p>你经历这个过程，一路学习，不做任何假设。忘掉你对开悟的执念。忘掉你对成为圣人的执念。忘掉你对精神的所有浪漫幻想。因为这段旅程根本不会是这样的。</p>
<p>Do not think that everything you are going through is magnificent and significant. When you are climbing a great mountain, you are just taking the steps. The pathway continues. You can quit at any time. But at a certain point, halfway up the mountain, do you really want to have to go back down and undo all of your progress?</p>
<p>不要认为你经历的一切都是伟大的、意义非凡的。攀登高山，你只是在一步步迈出。路还在继续。你可以随时放弃。但到了某个时刻，爬到半山腰，你真的想回到原点，让你所有的进步化为乌有吗？</p>
<p>You can camp out where you are for a time, but the journey still awaits you, and you have not reached your destination. Your mind is still unclear and is full of clouds and darkness. And you are still prone to giving yourself away to various kinds of persuasions and seductions. You are still driven by fear and insecurity. And you are still losing power to others and to your own compromises.</p>
<p>你可以暂时在原地扎营，但旅程仍在等待你，而你尚未抵达目的地。你的心灵依然混沌，充满阴云和黑暗。你仍然容易屈服于各种劝说和诱惑。你仍然被恐惧和不安全感所驱使。你仍然在向他人和你自身的妥协中失去力量。</p>
<p>So there is no peace or resolution by stopping halfway. Even though your life is improving, you cannot claim: “Well, I have arrived now. This is good enough for me.” It might be good enough for your insecure intellect, but it will not be good enough for your soul. You were not designed to go only halfway. You were designed to go the whole way.</p>
<p>所以，半途而废并不能带来平静或解决。即使你的生命正在改善，你也不能声称：“好吧，我现在已经到达了。这对我来说已经足够好了。”也许这对你缺乏安全感的智力来说足够好，但对你的灵魂来说却不够好。你生来就不应该只走一半的路。你生来就应该走完全程。</p>
<p>Everyone was given a greater purpose and a specific set of tasks to discover and to accomplish before they came into the world. These were placed within Knowledge within each person, awaiting the time when they would be free enough and mature enough and responsive enough to begin this greater pathway in life. Perhaps they started young. Perhaps they began in the middle age. Perhaps they began later in life. But they reached the point where they had to begin.</p>
<p>每个人在来到世界之前，都被赋予了一个更伟大的目的和一系列特定的任务去发现和完成。这些被置于每个人内在的内识里，等待着他们足够自由、足够成熟、足够有回应力，去开启这条更伟大生命之路的时刻。或许他们从年轻时开始。或许他们从中年开始。或许他们从晚年开始。但他们到达了他们必须开始的那个点。</p>
<p>The journey is not easy, not because it is so strenuous, but because it exists beyond and outside the realm of your definitions and control. People find that very hard to deal with. In essence, it is not really that hard going up the long winding trail to the top of this mountain. You just have to keep taking steps, and make sure that you have the provisions that you need, and that you are managing your outer affairs sufficiently that you can take such a journey.</p>
<p>这段旅程并不容易，并非因为它多么艰辛，而是因为它存在于你的定义和控制范围之外。人们发现这很难应对。本质上，沿着蜿蜒的长路攀登到山顶其实并不难。你只需要继续迈步，确保你拥有所需的补给，并且你妥善管理好你的外在事务，以便能够踏上这样的旅程。</p>
<p>It is difficult, but not strenuous. What makes it seem strenuous is that people are constantly fighting with themselves, trying to assert and reassert their self-control, battling with their self-doubt, being attracted by that which seems easy and pleasant—an easy life, a life of security, which is only a life of compromise and bondage. So many other people are choosing that life. So why aren’t you choosing that life? Why are you putting yourself through this whole process that is so mysterious and confounding?</p>
<p>它是困难的，但并不费劲。之所以觉得费劲，是因为人们不断地与他们自己斗争，试图一次又一次地维护他们的自控力，与自我怀疑作斗争，被那些看似轻松愉快的事物所吸引——轻松的生活，安全的生活，但实际上，它只是一种妥协和束缚的生命。那么多人都在选择这样的生命。那么，你为什么不选择这样的生命呢？你为什么要让你自己经历这整个如此神秘而令人困惑的过程呢？</p>
<p>You are doing this because you must, because it is there for you to do, and you know you must do it. And that Knowledge is your motivation. It is your justification. It is your confirmation.</p>
<p>你这样做是因为你必须这样做，因为这是你必须做的，而且你知道你必须这样做。而那份内识就是你的动力。它是你的正当理由。它是你的确认。</p>
<p>But people go crying and screaming and complaining the whole way. They are not getting what they want. They are not understanding what they are doing. They are giving up seemingly wonderful things for some great unknown in the future. And they are constantly questioning why they are doing that.</p>
<p>但人们一路上都在哭喊、尖叫、抱怨。他们没有得到想要的东西。他们不理解他们在做什么。他们为了未来未知的事物，放弃了看似美好的一切。他们不断地质疑他们为什么要这样做。</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Knowledge is not depriving them of anything that is valuable, but it is pulling them away from where they would take themselves otherwise, where the culture would take them otherwise and where their social conditioning would take them otherwise. So there is lots of stopping and starting, self-doubt, and turning around, questioning oneself. And so it seems very hard. Yet the journey itself is not so hard.</p>
<p>与此同时，内识并没有剥夺他们任何有价值的东西，而是将他们从原本会引领他们走向的方向、文化会引领他们走向的方向以及社会条件会引领他们走向的方向拉开。因此，他们经历了许多走走停停、不断前行、自我怀疑、不断回头、不断质疑自我的过程。这看起来非常艰难。然而，旅程本身并没有那么艰难。</p>
<p>It is living without Knowledge—without certainty, without clarity of purpose, and without real inspiration—that is hard, that is strenuous. It is hard and strenuous, and it yields nothing in the end. You are working for nothing. You are sacrificing for nothing. You are choosing that which will fail. You are choosing that which is inadequate, or insufficient to your real needs. You are choosing relationships that can never really go where you must go. You are making compromises that will hold you back, out of self-doubt and insecurity. They will yield nothing but frustration and disappointment.</p>
<p>没有内识的生活——没有确定性，没有明晰的目的，没有真正的灵感——是艰难的，是费力的。它艰难而费力，最终却一无所获。你是在白费力气。你是在白白牺牲。你选择的是失败。你选择的是不足的，或者不足以满足你真正需求的。你选择的是永远无法真正通往你必须去往之所的关系。你出于自我怀疑和不安全感，做出阻碍你的妥协。它们只会带来挫败和失望。</p>
<p>So you are giving up nothing for everything. But along the way you may feel you are giving up everything for nothing. This is how confused your mind is. This is how disassociated it is from the Source of your strength and power in life. This is the problem of Separation.</p>
<p>所以，你为了一切，什么也没放弃。但一路走来，你可能会觉得你放弃了一切，却什么也没得到。你的心灵就是如此混乱。它与你生命力量和能量的源泉如此疏离。这就是分离的问题。</p>
<p>People are investing in their intellect so heavily because they are disconnected from their real nature. They are trying to compensate, so they have super inflated ideas of themselves. They have super inflated ideas of life. They have super inflated ideas about spirituality. They have super inflated ideas about enlightenment or liberation and all these things because they are trying to compensate for their lack of connection to their deeper nature, to the power and presence of Knowledge within themselves.</p>
<p>人们如此沉迷于智力，是因为他们与他们真实的自然脱节。他们试图弥补，所以他们对他们自己抱有极其膨胀的想法。他们对生命抱有极其膨胀的想法。他们对精神性抱有极其膨胀的想法。他们对开悟或解脱等等抱有极其膨胀的想法，因为他们试图弥补与他们更深层次的自然、与他们自己内在内识的力量和存在之间缺乏联结的缺陷。</p>
<p>They are trying to understand without taking the mysterious journey. But you cannot replace the journey and what it will reveal. You cannot replace what life’s greatest experiences will reveal by simply trying to have an understanding, meanwhile compromising yourself in your relationships and in your work to be safe, to be secure. Poor little thing.</p>
<p>他们试图在不踏上神秘旅程的情况下理解一切。但你无法取代这段旅程以及它所揭示的一切。你无法取代生命中最伟大的经历所揭示的一切，仅仅试图去理解，同时却为了安全、安稳而在人际关系和工作中做出妥协。可怜的小家伙。</p>
<p>You sit at the bottom of the mountain thinking you understand it, and you do not. All you have is your overbuilt intellect with all of its self-gratifying ideas. And the truth is you have not made the journey.</p>
<p>你坐在山脚下，自以为理解了一切，其实不然。你所拥有的只是你那过度膨胀的智力，以及它所有那些自鸣得意的想法。而事实是，你根本就没有踏上旅程。</p>
<p>You fell out of the race to be comfortable on the side of the road. And from here on, you will take the journey in your imagination, or you will take the journey at the level of ideas. You will become theological and metaphysical and sophisticated; and have great debates with others and write profound books; and engage in academic pursuits.</p>
<p>你不再甘于安于路边的舒适生活。从此以后，你将踏上想象的旅程，或者踏上关于想法的旅程。你将变得神学、形而上学，变得世故；你将与他人进行激烈的辩论，写出深刻的著作；你将投身于学术研究。</p>
<p>Or you will just weave your own personal cosmology, patching together all your disparate ideas and sensations, grievances and goals; trying to create some coherence between all of these things that really do not go together; trying to make life fit into a simple definition, a simple set of ideas.</p>
<p>或者你只会编织你自身的个人宇宙观，把你所有不同的想法和感觉、不满和目标拼凑在一起；试图在所有这些实际上并不相容的事物之间创造某种连贯性；试图让生命符合一个简单的定义，一套简单的想法。</p>
<p>You are sitting by the side of the road fantasizing, justifying, compromising, when in truth you need only take the journey—without presumption, without conclusions, without great personal proclamations.</p>
<p>你坐在路边幻想、辩解、妥协，而事实上你只需要踏上旅程——没有假设，没有结论，没有伟大的个人宣言。</p>
<p>You must face the reality that society will not honor this. You will not be highly regarded for this. You will not be acclaimed for this. And even if you achieve the greater goals on this journey, if you are to receive acclaim here, it will be for all the wrong reasons. People will just try to use you to validate themselves. They will be praising you, but they will not understand your real accomplishments.</p>
<p>你必须面对现实，社会不会尊重你。你不会因此而受到高度重视。你不会因此而受到赞誉。即使你在这段旅程中实现了更伟大的目标，如果你想在此获得赞誉，那也完全是出于错误的理由。人们只会试图利用你来证明他们自己。他们会赞美你，但他们不会理解你真正的成就。</p>
<p>So there is no glory in glory. There is no fulfillment in acclaim. It becomes a burden and a nuisance, a problem because people want to be with you for all the wrong reasons. People value you for all the wrong reasons. They are trying to use you as their own personal resource.</p>
<p>因此，荣耀中没有荣耀，赞誉中没有满足感。它会成为一种负担、一种麻烦、一个问题，因为人们想和你在一起的理由全都是错误的。人们看重你的理由全都是错误的。他们试图把你当作他们自身的私人资源。</p>
<p>So the crowds gather to meet the great teacher, but they cannot receive what the teacher really has to offer them, which is the journey itself. They do not understand the teacher. His or her words are misinterpreted or are confounding. They want the benefit of the individual teacher’s accomplishments, but they themselves cannot receive it or comprehend it.</p>
<p>因此，人群聚集在一起，想要见到伟大的老师，但他们却无法接受老师真正要提供给他们的东西，也就是旅程本身。他们不理解老师。他或她的话被曲解或令人困惑。他们想从老师个人的成就中获益，但他们自己却无法接受或理解。</p>
<p>So what is personal revelation? Is it a fulfillment of the individual? Or is it a reunion with greater forces and powers in life, a return to the Divine Creation, a return to inclusion? That is where the glory is. That is where the happiness and fulfillment reside.</p>
<p>那么，什么是个人启示？它是个人的圆满吗？抑或是与生命中更伟大的力量和权力的重聚，是对神圣创造的回归，是对包容的回归？这才是荣耀所在。这才是幸福和满足的所在。</p>
<p>But the separated at the bottom of the mountain cannot understand these things. They sound wonderful. They sound glorious and divine. But those at the bottom cannot experience it. They cannot eat this food. They cannot digest this wisdom. So the teacher wants to get everyone up the mountain, and everyone wants the teacher to come down the mountain to be with them. So there is a conflict of purpose. And so the real engagement is rare.</p>
<p>但山脚下与世隔绝的人无法理解这些事。它们听起来很美妙，很荣耀，很神圣。但山下的人却无法体验。他们无法享用这些食物，无法消化这些智慧。所以，老师想让每个人都上山，而每个人都希望老师下山与他们同在。因此，存在着目的上的冲突。真正的参与也因此罕见。</p>
<p>The real teacher looks out and says: “Who amongst all these people is a real student, someone who could take this journey without driving themselves crazy, without falling away at the first difficulty or the first great attraction? Who has the patience and the perseverance to achieve real wisdom and to be able to participate in a greater set of relationships? Who is ready for real union in relationship with another, a union that represents a higher purpose in life and not merely a pursuit of personal gratification? Who is willing to follow the deep need of the soul and not just the transitory needs of the mind? Who is willing to be really responsible to their duties on the outside and not merely try to seek escape in their spiritual study? Who is really trustworthy? Who is capable of becoming really aware of their strengths and weaknesses to such a degree that they can build the former and manage the latter? Who is it here amongst these people who will not fail, who will make all the great investments that the Spiritual Powers will put in them and will not disappoint? Who is worthy of this investment? Who shows real promise? Who in the end will become a great contributor to the world?”</p>
<p>真正的老师会向外看去，问道：“所有这些人中，谁是真正的学生？谁能踏上这段旅程而不至于把他们自己逼疯，不至于在第一个困难或第一个巨大诱惑面前退缩？谁有耐心和毅力去获得真正的智慧，并能够参与到更伟大的关系中？谁准备好与他人建立真正的结合，这种结合代表着生命中的一种更高宗旨，而不仅仅是追求个人满足？谁愿意追随灵魂深处的需求，而不仅仅是心灵的短暂需求？谁愿意真正对他们的外在职责负责，而不仅仅是试图在精神研究中寻求逃避？谁是真正值得信赖的？谁能够真正意识到他们的优势和劣势，以至于能够构建优势并管理劣势？这些人中，谁不会失败？谁会做出精神力量在他们身上投入的所有伟大投资，并且不会令人失望？谁值得这份投资？谁展现出真正的承诺？谁最终会成为对世界做出伟大贡献的人？”</p>
<p>This is a problem for the teacher, so here even recognition and acclaim are empty things. People’s seeming interest and dedication are really more problematic now. There is no real sense of gratitude for this. People think they are really making progress when they are going nowhere at all. They are trying to have everything now. For them, it is like consumerism, like you are going shopping for spiritual insights, spiritual power and spiritual recognition. Everyone wants to be a great teacher, a saint, an acclaimed person.</p>
<p>这对老师来说是个问题，所以在这里，即使是认可和赞誉也只是空谈。人们表面上的兴趣和奉献精神现在实际上更成问题。对此缺乏真正的感恩之心。人们认为他们真的取得了进步，但实际上却一事无成。他们现在试图拥有一切。对他们来说，这就像消费主义，就像你去购物是为了获得精神上的洞见、精神上的力量和精神上的认可。每个人都想成为伟大的老师、圣人、受人赞誉的人。</p>
<p>This is how your Inner Teachers, who watch over your life, view your progress and lack of progress. The same challenge and frustration are some things that they experienced, as you continually think that your ideas alone are sufficient, where you are always drawn away by trivial pursuits or attractions, where you are constantly doubting your real motivation.</p>
<p>这就是守护你生命的内在导师们看待你的进步和停滞的方式。他们也经历过同样的挑战和挫折，因为你总是认为单凭你的想法就足够了，你总是被琐碎的追求或诱惑所吸引，你总是怀疑你真正的动机。</p>
<p>They are giving you signs and clues. And you miss ninety percent of them because your mind is so preoccupied with other things and not paying attention. So this is the challenge and the frustration of the teacher, the guide.</p>
<p>它们给你信号和线索。而你却错过了百分之九十，因为你的心灵被其他事物占据，没有集中注意力。所以，这对老师，对引导者来说，既是挑战，也是挫败。</p>
<p>The journey is real. It is pure. You do not create it for yourself. You either follow it, or you do not. It is great and mysterious, but it is very sure. If you keep taking those steps up the mountain, you will rise above the level of the trees. You will be able to see the greater panorama of life.</p>
<p>这段旅程真实存在，它是纯粹的。你并非为你自己创造它。你要么追随它，要么不追随。它伟大而神秘，却又无比确定。如果你继续攀登高峰，你将超越树木的高度。你将能够看到更伟大的生命全景。</p>
<p>You will be able to see the relationship of all things together because you have reached a point where this is obvious, whereas before you could not see these things, and so such a great Revelation was only conceptual. You could only try to imagine it, but your imagination will never fit the reality.</p>
<p>你将能够看到万物之间的关联，因为你已达到一个显而易见的境界。而在此之前，你无法看到这些，所以如此伟大的启示也只是概念性的。你只能试图去想象，但你的想象永远无法与现实相符。</p>
<p>If you will continue, you will reach your destination—along the way freeing yourself from weakness, freeing yourself from self-conflict, freeing yourself from the domination and persuasions of others; gaining strength, gaining courage, gaining determination, gaining wisdom and learning what the journey is really like so that one day perhaps you can guide someone because you have walked this journey.</p>
<p>如果你坚持下去，你就会到达你的目的地——一路上你将摆脱软弱，摆脱自我冲突，摆脱他人的控制和说服；获得力量，获得勇气，获得决心，获得智慧，并学习这段旅程的真正意义，这样也许有一天你可以引导某人，因为你走过这段旅程。</p>
<p>You have gone through the clouds of unknowing. You have gone through periods of great self-doubt and consternation. You have seen beautiful things along the way. You have gained the strength. You have lost the fetters and the chains that were holding you back. You understand because you have done this.</p>
<p>你已穿越未知的云层。你已经历经了强烈的自我怀疑和惊愕。你一路上见证了美好的事物。你获得了力量。你已挣脱了束缚你的枷锁。你理解了，因为你已做到了。</p>
<p>So personal revelation is not just waking up one day, wise and clear, strong and determined. It is not like taking a pill or having God wave a wand in front of you. If you are stupid and lazy and indolent and easily deceived, you cannot assume these powers and these strengths.</p>
<p>所以，个人启示并非只是某天醒来，变得睿智明晰、坚强果断。它不像吃药，也不像上帝在你面前挥动魔杖。如果你愚昧懒惰、懈怠且容易受骗，你就无法拥有这些力量和实力。</p>
<p>God does not wave a wand and turn you into something you are not. You do not become great one day. You do not become clear one day. You do not become wise one day. It is not like shopping at the store where you pay your money and you get the product or the service. All the money in the world will not buy this.</p>
<p>上帝不会挥动魔杖，把你变成你原本的样子。你不会在某一天变得伟大。你不会在某一天变得清晰。你不会在某一天变得明智。这不像在商店购物，你付了钱，就得到了产品或服务。世界上所有的钱都买不到这一点。</p>
<p>There is a journey to take, a mountain to climb, a destination to reach, a process to undergo. It is real. It is more real than anything.</p>
<p>有一段旅程要走，有一座山要爬，有目的地要到达，有一段过程要经历。它是真实的。它比什么都真实。</p>
<p>When you leave this life, your Spiritual Family will be waiting for you to see if you have made this journey and how far you got. They will not care about your successes and your failures. They will not care about your personal tragedies. They will not care about your failed romances. They will not care about how much personal wealth you acquired. They will not care whether you gained social recognition or acclaim or not. That is nothing to them.</p>
<p>当你离开这个生命时，你的精神家人将等待着你，看看你是否完成了这段旅程，以及你走了多远。他们不会在意你的成功和失败。他们不会在意你的个人悲剧。他们不会在意你失败的恋情。他们不会在意你获得了多少个人财富。他们不会在意你是否获得了社会认可或赞誉。这些对他们来说都无关紧要。</p>
<p>You see the difference here? This is the difference that will make all the difference for you.</p>
<p>你看出区别了吗？这个区别将对你产生重大影响。</p>
<p>Your soul yearns for you to discover and fulfill your greater purpose here. To do this, you must undergo this tremendous preparation, this preparation that was created by God and that is managed by great Powers—a process that is beyond deception and manipulation, a process you cannot manipulate, a process you cannot corrupt. You either succeed or you fail. You either get up that trail or you fall away for something else. You either follow Knowledge or you follow other things.</p>
<p>你的灵魂渴望你发现并成就你在此的更伟大目的。为了做到这一点，你必须经历这个极大的准备，这个由上帝创造并由伟大力量管理的准备——一个超越欺骗和操控的过程，一个你无法操控的过程，一个你无法腐蚀的过程。你要么成功，要么失败。你要么踏上这条道路，要么堕落去追求其他事物。你要么追随内识，要么追随其他事物。</p>
<p>If you are impatient, you will try to have everything now: love, romance, partnership, success, everything. And you will give yourself to mad pursuits and dangerous involvements and foolish decisions and end up with nothing but disappointment and frustration. Even if you become famous and rich, your life will be empty and meaningless because you did not respond to the Calling of Knowledge and the deeper need of the soul.</p>
<p>如果你缺乏耐心，你就会试图立即拥有一切：爱情、浪漫、伴侣、成功，一切。你会沉迷于疯狂的追求、危险的牵扯和愚蠢的决定，最终只会带来失望和挫败。即使你名声显赫、财富滚滚，你的生命也会空虚无意义，因为你没有回应内识的召唤和灵魂更深层次的需求。</p>
<p>This is a gift of love. It is here to save you, to spare you endless tribulation, to free you from personal defeat, to lift you out of addiction and depression, anger and resentment. This is God’s answer to your prayer for purpose, meaning and direction in your life.</p>
<p>这是一份爱的礼物。它来拯救你，使你免于无尽的苦难，使你摆脱个人的挫败，使你摆脱毒瘾、抑郁、愤怒和怨恨。这是上帝对你寻求生命目的、意义和方向祷告的回应。</p>
<p>This is what you must do in this world to discover and to fulfill your greater purpose. For only Knowledge can take you there. And to get there, you must follow The Way of Knowledge, practice and live The Way of Knowledge. Knowledge is your guide now, not the intellect or others’ intellects, or society’s vaunted values, or the expectations of others, or the demands of your spouse. You are responding to a greater Calling here. And the Pathway is created by the Calling itself.</p>
<p>这就是你在这个世界上必须做的事情，才能发现并实现你更伟大的目的。因为唯有内识才能带你到达那里。而要到达那里，你必须遵循内识之路，实践并活出内识之路。现在，内识是你的指引，而不是智力或他人的智力，不是社会所吹捧的价值观，不是他人的期望，也不是你配偶的要求。你在此回应着一个更伟大的召唤。而这条路径正是由这召唤本身所创造的。</p>
<p>People are impatient because they want to be in charge. They want to make sure they get what they want. They want their pursuit to be in keeping with their social conditioning and the expectations of their culture and society. So their motives are all wrong. Their motives are all the problem, not the solution—wrong motivation, wrong goals, wrong approach, wrong understanding.</p>
<p>人们缺乏耐心，是因为他们想要掌控一切。他们想要确保他们得到想要的东西。他们希望他们的追求符合他们的社会条件以及文化和社会的期望。所以他们的动机完全是错误的。他们的动机本身就是问题，而不是解决方案——错误的动机、错误的目标、错误的方法、错误的理解。</p>
<p>And so even in the name of God, religion, and redemption, they will set out on their personal pursuit. But they are no different from the merchant who seeks riches and pleasures. They are no different from any other consumer of goods and services. It is just wealth and personal acclaim in different clothing now.</p>
<p>因此，即使以上帝、宗教和救赎的名义，他们也会踏上个人的追求之路。但他们与追求财富和享乐的商人并无二致。他们与其他任何商品和服务的消费者也并无二致。如今，只不过是披着不同外衣的财富和个人荣誉罢了。</p>
<p>This is not your goal and destiny. You were not sent into the world just to become lost in the world—lost in a world of desire and fear; lost in a world of confusion, frustration and disappointment. The world is disappointing unless you can find your greater purpose for coming here. The world cannot give you what you want. But you can give the world something it greatly needs.</p>
<p>这并非你的目标和天命。你被派到这个世界，并非只是为了迷失于这个世界——迷失于一个充满渴望和恐惧的世界；迷失于一个充满困惑、挫折和失望的世界。除非你能找到你来到这里的更伟大目的，否则这个世界是令人失望的。世界无法给予你想要的东西。但你可以给予世界它极其需要的东西。</p>
<p>This is what separates you from the animals and the plants and all the other creatures of life. That is why the journey is not just an attraction. It is a Calling. It is calling something deeper in you to respond. It is not speaking to your desires, your ambitions, your condemnation, or your fear. It is speaking to the greater part of you, your deeper nature.</p>
<p>正是这一点将你与动物、植物以及所有其他生命体区分开来。正因如此，旅程不仅仅是一种吸引力。它是一种召唤。它在召唤你内在一种更深层次的内识去回应。它并非在对你的渴望、你的野心、你的谴责或你的恐惧说话。它正在对你更伟大的部分、你更深层次的自然说话。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you is responding. It is this call and response, then, that continues throughout the journey and becomes stronger as you proceed, as you choose again and again to follow the Mystery and not fall away for other things.</p>
<p>你内在的内识正在回应。正是这份呼唤与回应，贯穿了你的整个旅程，并随着你的前行而变得更加强大，因为你一次又一次地选择追随神秘，而不是为了其他事物而偏离。</p>
<p>This only seems hard because it is different. But it is so much easier than trying to live a life of deception and compromise, of denial and frustration. It is the gift from God to you who have Knowledge alive within yourself.</p>
<p>这看似艰难，只是因为它与众不同。但这比试图活在欺骗与妥协、否定与挫败中要容易得多。它是上帝赐予你内在拥有鲜活内识的礼物。</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, you could not respond, and you would not find the strength to make such a journey. But Knowledge is within you. And it will become stronger within you as you take the Steps that Knowledge will provide.</p>
<p>没有内识，你无法回应，你也无法找到力量去踏上这样的旅程。但内识就在你的内在。当你踏上内识所提供的进阶时，它将在你的内在变得更加强大。</p>
<p>Then you will find a comfort and a security that nothing in the world can match. You will find a deeper relationship with certain people beyond anything that could be achieved otherwise. You will find where you can give your greatest gifts, and these situations will call these gifts out of you, where you could never find them for yourself before.</p>
<p>然后，你会找到一种世上无可比拟的慰藉和安全感。你会与某些人建立起一种超越任何其他方式所能达成的更深厚的关系。你会找到能够给予你最伟大礼物的地方，而这些处境会将这些礼物从你身上召唤出来，而这些礼物是你以前从未为你自己发现过的。</p>
<p>These words are not just to attract your attention. They are to speak to your heart and to your deeper nature. You do not know what this means yet or what the journey will be like, but that is fine, for nobody can really know that. You take this journey because you must, not because you think it is going to give you something you are desiring for yourself.</p>
<p>这些话语并非仅仅为了吸引你的注意力。它们是为了触动你的内心，触动你更深层次的自然。你还不知道这意味着什么，也不知道这段旅程将会是怎样，但这没关系，因为没有人能够真正知道。你踏上这段旅程是因为你必须这样做，而不是因为你认为它会给你带来你渴望的东西。</p>
<p>There are encouragements, of course. But ultimately what keeps you on this path—what keeps you moving in your life, what keeps you from compromising yourself and giving your life away to other things—is the power and presence of Knowledge.</p>
<p>当然，有鼓励。但最终，让你走在这条道路上的——让你在生命中前进的——阻止你妥协你自己、不把你的生命交给其他事物的——是内识的力量和存在。</p>
<p>It is this Divine relationship between God and Knowledge that enables Knowledge to become activated, to lead you forward and to restore to you your real strength and your greater relationship with yourself, with others and with all life.</p>
<p>正是上帝和内识之间的这种神圣关系，让内识得以激活，引领你前行，并重建你真正的力量以及你与你自己、与他人以及与所有生命的更伟大关系。</p>
