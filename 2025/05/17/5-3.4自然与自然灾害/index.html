<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on September 1, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 9 月 1 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world is driven by powerful geologic and biologic forces. They were set in motion at the beginning of the physical universe. God has set them in motion to operate on their own, moving in a certain direction. This has produced immense turbulence, even after the creation of this planet. These turbulent forces work throughout the universe, depending on a world’s particular environment.</p>
<p>世界是由强大的地质和生物力量驱动的。这些力量在物质宇宙诞生之初就已启动。上帝使它们自行运转，朝着特定的方向运动。即使在地球被创造之后，这仍然产生了巨大的湍流。这些湍流力量在整个宇宙中发挥作用，取决于每个世界特定的环境。</p>
<p>Humanity has had to endure violent weather, droughts, floods, pestilence—all manner of things because this is all part of living within a changing environment governed by physical laws and natural laws.</p>
<p>人类必须忍受恶劣的天气、干旱、洪水、瘟疫等各种各样的事情，因为这都是在受物理定律和自然定律支配的不断变化的环境中生活的一部分。</p>
<p>Entirely different this is from your Ancient Home, from which you have come and to which you will return.</p>
<p>这与你来自并将回归的古老家园完全不同。</p>
<p>To be in an environment like this requires constant adaptation and constant problem solving. It is not easy. And while the world is beautiful and magnificent, it is also hazardous and difficult, placing great requirements on all intelligent creatures who live here, on all biological entities, but particularly upon those who are self-aware and who are aware of the future and the past.</p>
<p>在这样的环境中生存需要不断适应，不断解决问题。这并不容易。这个世界虽然美丽壮丽，但也充满危险和艰辛，对所有生活于此的智能生物，所有生物实体，尤其是那些拥有自我意识、洞悉未来和过去的人，都提出了极高的要求。</p>
<p>The fact that your life here is temporary and that your physical vehicle is temporary, as you experience being in the world, this places a further burden on you—a psychological burden now, and a great anxiety about the possibility of future difficulty and even the loss of your life.</p>
<p>事实上，你在此的生命是暂时的，你的物质载体也是暂时的，正如你体验身处世界时那样，这给你带来了进一步的负担——现在是一种心理负担，以及对未来困难甚至失去生命的可能性的一种巨大焦虑。</p>
<p>This is not a punishment from God, but it does represent what life means if you are living apart from God, if you are living in Separation. Life will be changing. Life will be difficult. It will be a life unlike your Ancient Home, unlike your heavenly state, and you will have to face many adversities.</p>
<p>这并非来自上帝的惩罚，但它确实代表了如果你远离上帝生活，如果你生活在分离之中，生命意味着什么。生命将会改变。生命将会艰难。它将是一种不同于你的古老家园、不同于你的天堂状态的生命，你将不得不面对许多逆境。</p>
<p>Now humanity is facing Great Waves of change—changing climate, violent weather, diminishing resources, environmental degradation, mounting economic and political instability and a greater risk of conflict and war over the remaining resources.</p>
<p>现在，人类正面临着巨大的变革浪潮——气候变化、恶劣的天气、资源减少、环境恶化、经济和政治不稳定加剧以及因剩余资源而引发冲突和战争的风险增大。</p>
<p>You have come into the world to live in the face of these Great Waves of change, and these Great Waves of change are already occurring in the world today. Perhaps you have not faced them yet. Perhaps you are yet unaware of the magnitude of the Great Waves of change. This is now having a great impact, altering the balance of the natural environment, setting in train forces of change in your climate, creating greater disasters—hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and droughts, extreme and violent weather conditions in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>你来到这个世界，是为了生活在这些变革的巨浪面前，而这些变革的巨浪如今已然在世界上发生。或许你尚未面对它们。或许你尚未察觉到变革巨浪的规模。这正在产生巨大的影响，改变着自然环境的平衡，引发着你们气候的改变力量，制造着更严重的灾难——飓风、龙卷风、洪水和干旱，以及世界许多地方的极端和猛烈的天气状况。</p>
<p>Humanity’s overuse and abuse of the world is now changing the natural balance, and this change is not in your favor. Even at this moment, nations and peoples do not seem to comprehend the magnitude of what is happening. People do not want to give up their privileges. Networks of trade and the exploitation of resources are now well established. People do not want to restrain themselves. In certain wealthy nations, limits will be placed, but in other nations, there are no such limits and no such restraints.</p>
<p>人类对世界的过度使用和滥用正在改变自然平衡，而这种改变对你们不利。即使在此刻，各个国家和民族似乎仍未理解正在发生的事情的严重性。人们不愿放弃他们的特权。贸易网络和资源剥削如今已根深蒂固。人们不愿自我约束。在某些富裕国家，人们会受到限制，但在其他国家，既没有这样的限制，也没有这样的约束。</p>
<p>This means that humanity will further impact the natural environment, and the natural environment will further impact humanity. In the end, of course, nature will be victorious. But this creates a dilemma, you see, a fundamental dilemma because greater than your national laws, greater than your social customs, greater than your religious beliefs, greater than your individual or national attitudes or perspective is your fundamental relationship with nature—your relationship with your environment.</p>
<p>这意味着人类将进一步影响自然环境，而自然环境也将进一步影响人类。最终，自然当然会取得胜利。但这也造成了一个困境，一个根本性的困境，因为比你们的国家法律、社会习俗、宗教信仰、个人或国家态度或观点更重要的，是你们与自然的根本关系——你们与环境的关系。</p>
<p>Humanity as a whole has lost touch with this, has lost the recognition of the power and the importance of your relationship with your environment. You feel that with technology you can overcome the forces of nature, and to a certain degree, you can harness these forces, but you cannot overcome them. Throughout the universe, powerful nations have tried but have only found themselves to be at the mercy of the greater powers and forces of nature.</p>
<p>人类作为一个整体已经与此失去联系，失去了对你们与环境关系的力量及其重要性的认知。你们觉得凭借科技你们可以克服自然的力量，并且在某种程度上你们可以驾驭这些力量，但你们无法战胜它们。在整个宇宙中，强大的国家都曾尝试过，但最终却发现他们自己只能任由更强大的自然力量摆布。</p>
<p>At this moment, humanity, like an adolescent, is giddy with its own power, thinking that it has the ability to transcend the natural world, to create an environment not subject to the forces of nature. But this is not true. You are experiencing, even at this moment, the powerful response, the powerful reaction of natural law to human abuse and human irresponsibility, and the results are tragic.</p>
<p>此时此刻，人类如同青少年，陶醉于它自身的力量，认为他能够超越自然界，创造一个不受自然力量支配的环境。但这并非事实。即使在此时此刻，你们也正在经历着自然法则对人类滥用和不负责任行为的强烈反应，其后果是悲剧性的。</p>
<p>Your planet is getting warmer. Hotter. Drier. It is driving change. The world will change to a new kind of balance, but it will not be a balance that will be favorable to the human family. And the only way to alter this and to prevent this outcome would be a radical change in human behavior and activity and governance, which are unlikely to happen any time soon.</p>
<p>你们的星球正在变暖。更热。更干燥。它正在推动变革。世界将转向一种新的平衡，但这并非一种有利于人类大家庭的平衡。改变这一现状并阻止这一结果的唯一途径，是彻底改变人类的行为、活动和治理，而这不太可能在短期内发生。</p>
<p>Even in your separated state, you have to submit to the forces that govern your life. You can control them up to a point. You can mitigate the hazards. You can develop the opportunities. Perhaps even for a brief period, you can create great affluence for a large portion of the human family. But in the end nature will be dominant.</p>
<p>即使在你分离的状态下，你也必须顺服那些掌控你生命的力量。你可以在一定程度上控制它们。你可以减轻危险。你可以开发机遇。或许，哪怕只是短暂的一段时间，你也能为人类家庭的大部分成员创造巨大的富足。但最终，自然将占据主导地位。</p>
<p>If humanity exhausts the resources of this world, it will fall under the persuasion of foreign powers in the universe, who will seek to exploit a weak and divided humanity. They will seek to gain control of the world’s natural beauty and resources, a world rich with biological diversity, a world highly valued by others.</p>
<p>如果人类耗尽了这个世界的资源，就会落入宇宙外来势力的圈套，这些势力会试图剥削弱小而分裂的人类。他们会试图控制这个世界的自然美景和资源，一个生物多样性丰富的世界，一个受其他种族高度重视的世界。</p>
<p>They will not come now because they will not use force. Force is not the strength they will use. It will be the force of persuasion. And the more destitute humanity becomes as a result of its own behavior, the more powerful this persuasion will be and the less humanity will be able to resist the temptation of the offerings of those who come under the pretension of being here for peaceful purposes, but who in fact are here to take advantage of you and your situation.</p>
<p>他们现在不会来，因为他们不会使用武力。武力并非他们将使用的力量。它将是说服的力量。人类因其自身行为而变得越贫困，这种说服力就越强大，人类就越无法抵挡那些假装为和平目的而来、但实际上却在此利用你们和你们处境之人的供奉的诱惑。</p>
<p>These forces will be small, but clever. They will see that you have robbed yourself, and now you are poor and you will not be in a position to resist the temptation of what they have to offer—stability, security, resources—things that you have given away, things that have been sacrificed here on Earth.</p>
<p>这些势力规模虽小，却非常狡猾。他们会发现你们掠夺了自己，如今你们一贫如洗，无法抵挡他们提供的诱惑——稳定、安全、资源——这些都是你们已经放弃的东西，是你们在地球上牺牲的东西。</p>
<p>These forces will not come in great masses or great numbers. It will only take small groups of individuals to gain pre-eminence in this world, under the conditions of human degradation.</p>
<p>这些势力不会以巨大的规模或数量出现。在人类堕落的条件下，只需要一小群个体就能在这个世界上取得主导地位。</p>
<p>This does not have to be your fate. This does not have to be your destiny. This is not meant to be. It is a result of the decisions—countless decisions made previously, decisions being made today and the decisions being made tomorrow.</p>
<p>这不一定是你们的命运。这不一定是你们的宿命。这并非注定。它是你们做出的决定的结果——无数你们之前做出的决定，今天正在做出的决定，以及明天正在做出的决定。</p>
<p>Already, forces of change have been unleashed on the world, which will alter, in some cases radically, the circumstances of large parts of the human family. Even if you were to alter course, even if you were to restrain yourself and your activities, you have already set in motion forces you cannot change.</p>
<p>变革的力量已然在世界上释放，这将改变人类大家庭中许多成员的境况，在某些情况下甚至是彻底的改变。即使你们改变方向，即使你们克制自己和你们的行为，你们也已经启动了你们无法改变的力量。</p>
<p>You may call these forces “acts of God.” You may think that God is bringing violent weather and drought conditions as a kind of punishment, but it is not true. These represent your impact upon the environment.</p>
<p>你可能会把这些力量称为“天灾”。你或许认为上帝带来恶劣天气和干旱是一种惩罚，但事实并非如此。这些代表了你们对环境的影响。</p>
<p>If you empty the well, the well is dry. If you do not farm correctly, the soil blows away. If you burn too many things into the environment, the weather changes. If you overexploit the world for resources, the resources disappear.</p>
<p>如果你们把井水抽干，井水就会干涸。如果你们耕作不当，土壤就会被风吹走。如果你们在环境中燃烧过多的物质，天气就会发生变化。如果你们过度开发世界资源，资源就会消失。</p>
<p>It does not take a genius to figure this out. It takes common sense, but common sense is not common, it seems.</p>
<p>解决这个问题并不需要天才，只需要常识，但常识似乎并不常见。</p>
<p>So here you are facing the consequences of humanity’s destructive impact upon the world. And these impacts will continue. God is not creating them though God has created the mechanisms of life and set in motion the geological forces that have shaped the physical universe, and continue to shape it in an evolutionary pattern. You can blame God for the fact that there are hurricanes. “Why did you [God] create hurricanes?” you may ask, but God only created the conditions under which hurricanes emerge. That was before there was any life in this world. But God did not create this [specific] hurricane to punish humanity. This is foolishness. This is ignorant.</p>
<p>所以，你们现在正面临着人类对世界造成破坏性影响的后果。这些影响将会持续下去。上帝并没有创造这些影响，尽管上帝创造了生命的机制，并启动了塑造物质宇宙的地质力量，这些力量以进化的模式继续塑造着它。你可以将飓风的存在归咎于上帝。你可能会问：“你（上帝）为什么创造飓风？”但上帝只是创造了飓风产生的条件。那是在世界上出现任何生命之前。但上帝创造这场（特定的）飓风并非为了惩罚人类。这是愚蠢的。这是无知的。</p>
<p>If humanity continues in its present course, it will generate more events of this kind. Large parts of the world will be heavily damaged, and great droughts will fall upon the arid regions, driving people out. Nations will collapse. There will be millions of refugees with nowhere to go.</p>
<p>如果人类继续按照目前的方式发展，将会引发更多类似的事件。世界大片地区将遭受严重破坏，干旱地区将遭遇严重旱灾，迫使人们逃离家园。国家将崩溃。数百万难民将无处可去。</p>
<p>Humanity will lose its most valuable resources through overexploitation, through ignorant use, through a heedlessness of the future. Not thinking ahead, humanity is going to take everything now, robbing your children of their future, creating a future of unimaginable difficulties. There is no punishment here. It is merely consequence.</p>
<p>人类将因过度开发、无知的利用和对未来的漠视而失去其最宝贵的资源。人类不考虑未来，现在就将夺走一切，剥夺子孙后代的未来，创造一个充满难以想象的困境的未来。这里没有惩罚，它仅仅只是后果。</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to learn of the natural world and to use it effectively in a manner that can be sustained. This has been learned throughout the ages. It is not a new learning. But humanity has forfeited this knowledge out of greed, out of corruption, out of ambition. And now the world has a great many people in it. The boat is full.</p>
<p>你们有责任了解自然界，并以可持续的方式有效使用它。这早已是古往今来人们的共同经验，并非新知。然而，人类却因为贪婪、腐败和野心而丧失了这些知识。如今，这个世界人口众多，船已满。</p>
<p>How will you manage such circumstances? How will you face the Great Waves of change? How can you bring and restore greater balance in the natural world for your benefit? The answer is beyond your intellect. Though you may have very good ideas, and there are many solutions that are being proposed that will be very helpful overall if brought together and if utilized fully, but really the answer to these questions has to go deeper than the intellect, deeper into you.</p>
<p>你将如何应对这样的境况？你将如何面对变革的巨浪？你如何才能为你们的利益带来并重建自然界的更大平衡？答案超越了你的智力。尽管你可能拥有非常好的想法，也有很多正在提出的解决方案，如果整合起来并得到充分利用，总体上将非常有益，但真正这些问题的答案必须比智力更深入，更深入你的内心。</p>
<p>It is not a problem for other people to solve for you. It is a problem for everyone. It is not merely a problem for governments, or for science, or for politicians. It is a problem for everyone.</p>
<p>它不是一个别人能帮你解决的问题。它是每个人的问题。它不仅仅是政府、科学或政客的问题。它是每个人的问题。</p>
<p>This represents your relationship with nature. If you violate the relationship, you will have a bad relationship. It will be unhealthy. It will be unstable. There will be friction. There will be difficulty.</p>
<p>这代表着你与自然的关系。如果你破坏了这种关系，你的关系就会变得糟糕。它会不健康，不稳定，会产生摩擦，带来困难。</p>
<p>Just like you having a relationship with another person, if you abuse that person, if you do not respect that person, they will behave in a manner and will respond in a manner that will be unpleasant and discordant. There will be difficulties between you. You will not function in harmony together.</p>
<p>就像你和另一个人的关系一样，如果你辱骂对方，如果你不尊重对方，他们的行为举止和回应方式都会令人不快，不和谐。你们之间就会出现问题，无法和谐相处。</p>
<p>It is like this with your relationship with nature. If you show no respect for nature, if you do not respect how it functions and how you must behave within this relationship, then the relationship becomes discordant—producing unwanted results, unpleasant experiences.</p>
<p>你与自然的关系也是如此。如果你不尊重自然，如果你不尊重它的运作方式以及你在这种关系中必须如何表现，那么这种关系就会变得不和谐——产生不想要的结果，产生不愉快的体验。</p>
<p>If you do not take care of your home, it ceases to be a desirable place to live. If your house is falling apart, if you cannot or will not keep it up, it becomes an undesirable place to live. The world represents the home of humanity. If it is not supported and sustained and managed properly, as far as you can manage it, it ceases to become a desirable place to live.</p>
<p>如果你不好好照顾你的家，它就不再是一个理想的居住之所。如果你的房子摇摇欲坠，如果你无力或不愿维护它，它就不再是一个理想的居住之所。世界是人类的家园。如果它得不到支持、维持和管理，即使你力所能及，它也不再是一个理想的居住之所。</p>
<p>You cannot change the laws of nature. You can limit the impact of nature’s difficulties. You can enhance and develop its opportunities and its benefits. You can utilize natural forces to your benefit. That is what humanity has been doing all along, but it is a balance. And humanity has lost the balance.</p>
<p>你无法改变自然法则。你可以限制自然灾害的影响。你可以增强和发展它的机遇和益处。你们可以善用自然力量为自己谋取益处。这正是人类一直以来所做的，但这是一种平衡。而人类已经失去了这种平衡。</p>
<p>Gaining technology has given you a sense of pre-eminence, and you have taken it too far. If humanity were intelligent, you would be rationing fuel today and not waiting for when rationing will be forced upon you. You would be preserving your finest energy and resources instead of using them up as quickly as possible—believing, assuming, that there will be something there to replace them, without any difficulty in transition.</p>
<p>科技的进步让你们产生了一种优越感，你们已经走得太远了。如果人类真的聪明，你们现在就会实行燃料限量，而不是等到什么时候被强制限量。你们会保存你们最宝贵的能源和资源，而不是尽快耗尽它们——相信、假设会有某种东西来取代它们，而且过渡过程不会有任何困难。</p>
<p>But humanity has created a style of living that far exceeds the carrying capacity of your environment and that places you out of balance with the natural world, and even places you out of harmony with your own nature. Now you are driven to excess—excessive behavior, excessive busyness, excessive use of the world’s resources, excessive indulgences.</p>
<p>但人类创造了一种生活方式，远远超出了你们环境的承载能力，使你们与自然界失去平衡，甚至与你们自身的自然失去和谐。现在，你们被驱使走向了过度——行为过度，过度忙碌，过度消耗世界资源，过度放纵。</p>
<p>Your relationship with time has changed. Your relationship with nature has changed. And your relationship with one another has changed.</p>
<p>你与时间的关系改变了。你与自然的关系改变了。你与他人的关系改变了。</p>
<p>Now you are busy trying to sustain a lifestyle that deprives most of the human family—where the very rich are driving the engine of war, robbing nations and peoples of their own sustaining resources, driving headlong as if you did not have a future, as if you did not care, under a whole array of assumptions that somehow your technology and your cleverness and ingenuity will find a way to keep it all going.</p>
<p>现在，你们正忙于维持一种剥夺大多数人类家庭权利的生活方式——富人驾驶着战争的引擎，掠夺着各个国家和人民赖以生存的资源，一头扎进战争之中，仿佛你们没有未来，仿佛你们毫不关心，你们心中有着一系列的假设，认为你们的技术、你们的聪明才智和独创性将找到一种方法来让这一切继续下去。</p>
<p>You have abandoned your relationship with nature. You have taken on a mistress of technology, forcing a kind of adultery that has set you out of accord with yourself, with one another and with your environment.</p>
<p>你们抛弃了与自然的关系，接受了科技的诱惑，强迫你们自己与自然通奸，这导致你们与自己、与他人、与环境格格不入。</p>
<p>God will not intervene to stop all of this. God will only encourage you to behave correctly, for God has placed a deeper Knowledge within each person through which the Will and the Power of God can flow. But people have lost their native sense. They have forfeited their relationship with this deeper Knowledge to have, and to be and to do what they want—driven by passion and fantasy, driven by a new set of needs now that far exceeds your basic needs of living in the world.</p>
<p>上帝不会干预来阻止这一切。上帝只会鼓励你正确地行事，因为上帝已经将一个更深层次的内识置于每个人内在，上帝的意志和力量由此得以流淌。但人们已丧失了他们原生的感知。他们已经丧失了与这个更深层次内识的关联，去拥有、去成为、去做他们想要的一切——被激情和幻想所驱动，被如今远超你们在世间生存基本需求的一系列新需求所驱动。</p>
<p>So God speaks, but you cannot hear. You cannot feel, except perhaps superficially or periodically, the restraints that God is trying to place upon your actions and the motivation that God is giving you for other kinds of action. It is as if you are out of control and cannot stop yourself, like a person who is eating but cannot stop eating even though they have far exceeded already the needs of the body. Now they keep eating to satiate some kind of emotional insecurity, some kind of sense of deficiency and loss within themselves.</p>
<p>因此，上帝讲话，你却听不见。你无法感受到，或许只是表面上或偶尔地感受到，上帝试图对你的行为施加的限制，以及上帝赋予你其他行动的动力。你仿佛失去了控制，无法控制你自己，就像一个人在吃东西，却停不下来，即使他已经远远超出了身体的需求。现在，他们继续吃，是为了满足内心某种情感上的不安全感，某种匮乏感和失落感。</p>
<p>While God has created this immense physical reality, God has also placed Knowledge within you to teach you how to live in it and to give you the opportunity to re-experience your connection with your Ancient Home, even while you are here, especially while you are here. You cannot return to your Ancient Home if your mind is set in Separation. You do not simply die and go to Heaven. You have to prepare for your Ancient Home, and that provides you a greater purpose for being in this physical reality, with all of its difficulties and challenges.</p>
<p>虽然上帝创造了这个极大的物质现实，但上帝也将内识置于你的内在，教导你如何在其中生活，并赋予你机会重新体验你与你古老家园的联接，即使你身处此地，尤其当你身处此地。如果你的心灵固着于分离，你就无法回归你的古老家园。你并非简单地死去然后升入天堂。你必须为你的古老家园进行准备，这为你身处这个物质现实，以及它所有的艰难和挑战，提供了更伟大的目的。</p>
<p>You may look at nature aesthetically, marveling at its magnificence, its beauty, its diversity, its splendor, its complexity, and indeed nature provides all of these things. But you still have to survive within it, and survival is not easy. Perhaps your technology has made it seem easy, but that just means that other people are doing the work for you or that machines are doing the work for you, but you must feed these machines energy, and the greater the number of machines feeding you, the more energy they all require.</p>
<p>你或许会以审美的眼光审视自然，惊叹于它的规模、美丽、多样性、壮丽和复杂性，而大自然的确提供了所有这些。但你仍然需要在自然中生存，而生存并非易事。或许你们的科技让生存看起来很容易，但那只是意味着其他人在为你工作，或者机器在为你工作，但你必须为这些机器提供能量，而为你提供能量的机器数量越多，它们所需的能量就越多。</p>
<p>What can restore you to your real balance living in the world? What can prepare you for your Ancient Home? What can give you power, certainty and strength to counteract all of your other tendencies and the other tendencies of people around you?</p>
<p>什么能让你重拾你身处世间的真正平衡？什么能让你为你的古老家园进行准备？什么能赋予你力量、确定性和实力，去对抗你以及你周围人们的所有其他倾向？</p>
<p>Your intellect does not have an answer for this, for the answer comes from beyond human creation and imagination. God has placed a deeper Knowledge within you. Only it knows the way out of your dilemma, and the more that you take the Steps to Knowledge and experience your connection to Knowledge, the more your activities will fall in line with the harmony of the natural world, and you will be drawn away from behaviors that are harming this relationship, that are creating a future that will be undesirable and in some cases unlivable.</p>
<p>你的智力对此没有答案，因为答案来自超越人类的创造和想象。上帝将一个更深层次的内识放置在你的内在。唯有它知道走出你的困境的道路，你越是进行内识进阶，体验你与内识的联接，你的活动就越能与自然世界的和谐相符，你就越能远离那些损害这个关系的行为，那些正在创造一个不受欢迎、在某些情况下不宜居的未来的行为。</p>
<p>All of the forces that are driving humanity to its own demise are counteracted by the presence and the power of Knowledge. What will restrain people from destroying their natural inheritance here? Good ideas? Reform movements? These will not be strong enough to counteract what has been set in motion by human greed and human ignorance. It will have to be a more powerful force.</p>
<p>所有驱使人类走向自身毁灭的力量，都被内识的存在和力量所抵消。什么将阻止人们摧毁他们在此的自然遗产？好的想法？改革运动？这些将不足以抵消人类贪婪和人类无知所引发的一切。它必须是一种更强大的力量。</p>
<p>What can take people out of addiction but a force that is more powerful than the addiction? What can stop humanity’s desecration of the world? What can stop humanity from overspending its natural inheritance? What can stop war? What can stop human cruelty? What can mitigate and eventually stop all of the actions that are endangering your future and that are already setting the natural world against you?</p>
<p>除了比成瘾更强大的力量，还有什么能让人们摆脱成瘾？还有什么能阻止人类对世界的亵渎？还有什么能阻止人类过度消耗其自然遗产？还有什么能阻止战争？还有什么能阻止人类的残忍？还有什么能减轻并最终阻止所有危及你们未来、并已将自然世界置于你们对立面的行为？</p>
<p>It must be a more powerful force. You know you should not do things, but you do them anyway. You know you should not be living a certain way, but you live it anyway. You know that perhaps you have an unhealthy relationship with work or with other people, but you do not change course. You know you are unhappy, but you will not alter the circumstances that are bringing this unhappiness to you. Why is this?</p>
<p>它一定是一种更强大的力量。你知道你不应该做某些事，但你还是会去做。你知道你不应该以某种方式生活，但你还是会那样生活。你知道你与工作或他人的关系可能不健康，但你却不愿改变。你知道你不快乐，但你不愿改变那些给你带来不快乐的环境。为什么会这样？</p>
<p>There are many answers, of course, but in the end it will take a more powerful force to alter the momentum of your life—the obligations, the attachments and the associations you make with yourself, with other people and with the whole world, that are sending your life in the direction of disaster. There must be a more powerful force, and where will that come from?</p>
<p>当然，答案有许多，但归根结底，需要一种更强大的力量来改变你生命的动力——那些你对你自己、对他人、对整个世界所承担的义务、执着和联系，它们正将你的生命推向灾难。一定存在着一种更强大的力量，这种力量来自哪里呢？</p>
<p>Within you, you have strength and you have weakness. You have wisdom and you have ignorance. That which is strong and wise within you must be predominant if you are to experience the great benefits that this will yield.</p>
<p>在你的内在，你有力量，也有弱点。你有智慧，也有无知。如果你要体验由此带来的巨大益处，你内在的强大和智慧必须占据主导地位。</p>
<p>God has placed a deeper Knowledge within you. It is the source of your integrity and your wisdom and your ability to see the truth and to respond to the truth. It is the source of your courage. It is the source of your strength.</p>
<p>上帝已将一个更深层次的内识置于你的内在。它是你的完整性、你的智慧以及你洞察真理和回应真理的能力的源泉。它是你的勇气的源泉。它是你力量的源泉。</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, you will act foolishly and follow the foolish actions of others. You will live for the moment only, forfeiting your future and your preparation for the future. You will live selfishly, unaware or uncaring about the consequences of your actions upon others. You will try to acquire all things for yourself—pleasure, happiness, acquisitions—heedless of the consequences. You will forfeit your relationship with nature and even your relationship with your deeper nature in order to have and to fulfill the desires and the addictions and the fantasies of the mind.</p>
<p>没有内识，你将愚蠢地行动，并效仿他人愚蠢的行为。你将只为当下而活，放弃你的未来以及你对未来的准备。你将自私地生活，不去察觉或不去关心你的行为对他人造成的后果。你将试图为你自己获取一切——快乐、幸福、所得——而不顾后果。你将放弃你与自然的关系，甚至你与你更深层次自然的关系，以便拥有和满足心灵的渴望、沉迷和空想。</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, you will do these things. Perhaps you will feel guilty and uneasy about it, but you will still do it. Maybe you will not do it to the excess of others, but you will still be drawn. You will give into fear—the fear of not having. And this fear of not having will drive you to do things that are unhealthy.</p>
<p>没有内识，你就会做这些事。或许你会为此感到内疚和不安，但你仍然会去做。或许你不会做得比别人过分，但你仍然会被吸引。你会屈服于恐惧——对一无所有的恐惧。而这种对一无所有的恐惧会驱使你去做不健康的事情。</p>
<p>You will marry the wrong people. You will take the wrong jobs. You will live in environments that are not right for you. You will ignore the warnings, even within yourself, about your actions. You will become addicted to people or places or things to try to fill the void and to drive out the anxiety that your behavior is creating.</p>
<p>你会嫁错人，会从事错误的工作，会生活在不适合你的环境中。你会忽视那些对你行为的警告，即使是在你内心深处。你会对某些人、某些地方或某些事物上瘾，试图填补内心的空虚，驱散你的行为所造成的焦虑。</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, you will do these things to some degree and maybe even to a great degree. Look around. Look how people are driven. They live lives that are desperate. They are slaves to their circumstances. They are slaves to their desires. They do not function like free people even in freer nations. They are agitated. They are fearful. They are preoccupied. They cannot sit still for five minutes. They are not aware of themselves or where their life is going. They are making terrible, sometimes ridiculous, decisions. They are giving themselves away to things that have no future. Why is this?</p>
<p>没有内识，你会在某种程度上，甚至在很大程度上做这些事。看看周围。看看人们是如何被驱使的。他们过着绝望的生活。他们是他们境遇的奴隶。他们是他们欲望的奴隶。即使在更自由的国家，他们也无法像自由人那样运作。他们焦虑不安。他们恐惧。他们心事重重。他们连五分钟都坐不住。他们没有察觉他们自己，也没有觉知他们的生命将走向何方。他们做出可怕的、有时甚至是荒谬的决定。他们把他们自己交付给那些没有未来的事情。为什么会这样？</p>
<p>You can blame many things, of course. You can blame culture. You can blame sinful attractions. You can blame the devil. You can blame God. You can blame a million things. But fundamentally it is because you are not being guided by Knowledge.</p>
<p>当然，你可以责怪很多事情。你可以责怪文化。你可以责怪罪恶的诱惑。你可以责怪魔鬼。你可以责怪上帝。你可以责怪无数的事情。但从根本上说，它是因为你没有受到内识的指引。</p>
<p>The truth here is simple. It is not complex. But a simple truth is difficult to fathom. It is not so simple to understand though it is simple by nature.</p>
<p>这里的真理很简单，并不复杂。但简单的真理却难以理解。虽然它本质上很简单，但理解起来却不那么简单。</p>
<p>God has given you a deeper nature. It is not out of harmony with nature around you. It knows where you need to go, what you need to do, what is healthy for you, what is unhealthy, where to give yourself, where not to give yourself, who to be with, who not to be with, what to follow in others, what not to follow in others. It is a perfect guiding system.</p>
<p>上帝赋予了你一种更深层次的自然。它与你周遭的自然和谐共存。它知道你需要去哪里，你需要做什么，什么对你有益，什么对你有害，在哪里给予你自己，在哪里不交出你自己，与谁为伴，不与谁为伴，在别人身上应该效仿什么，在别人身上不应该效仿什么。它是一个完美的指引系统。</p>
<p>But you must yield to it. You must discover it within your own experience. You must build a connection and relationship with it by taking the Steps to Knowledge. And you must learn to follow it—beginning in things that are small and then learning how to experience and to follow it in greater and more difficult matters.</p>
<p>但你必须臣服于它。你必须在你自身的体验里发现它。你必须通过开展内识进阶来构建与它的一种联接和关系。你必须学习遵循它——从微小的事情开始，然后学习如何在更伟大、更艰难的事情中体验它并遵循它。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you is uncompromising. You cannot make a deal with it. It is not like your personal mind, your worldly mind that can get what it wants through negotiation, through compromise. With Knowledge, it does not work like this. When you really know something, you really know it, and you cannot change it. You may try to dismiss it or overlay it with other things. You may even run away from it.</p>
<p>你内在的内识是不会妥协的。你无法与它做交易。它不像你的个人心灵，你的世俗心灵，可以通过谈判、通过妥协来得到它想要的东西。有了内识，事情就不会这样运作。当你真正知道某事时，你就是真正知道它，你无法改变它。你可能会试图将它抛诸脑后，或者用其他东西来掩盖它。你甚至可能会逃避它。</p>
<p>That is one of the reasons people are so busy and preoccupied: They are running away from themselves. They are running away from Knowledge. They are running away from their conscience, their deeper conscience, not the conscience that is created by culture with all of its rules and guidelines. It is a deeper conscience about what is fundamentally right and not right. People are running away from this. That is why they cannot sit still for five minutes without becoming agitated and anxious and disturbed. They have to jump up and go do something. They do not even know how to be with themselves.</p>
<p>这是人们如此忙碌和沉迷的原因之一：他们在逃避他们自己。他们在逃避内识。他们在逃避他们的良知，他们更深层次的良知，并非由文化及其所有规则和指导方针所创造的良知。它是一种关于什么从根本上是对的、什么不是的更深层次的良知。人们在逃避它。正因如此，他们连静坐五分钟都无法停止，否则就会变得焦躁、焦虑和不安。他们必须跳起来去做点什么。他们甚至不知道如何与他们自己相处。</p>
<p>This has really gotten out of hand, you see. And human civilization has gotten out of hand. It is wild, uncontrolled, like a train that is heading to the station, but it has no breaks.</p>
<p>你看，这真的失控了。人类文明也失控了。它狂野不羁，不受控制，就像一列驶向车站的火车，却没有刹车。</p>
<p>The Great Waves of change that are coming to the world represent nature’s response, the consequences of your violation of nature and your squandering of your natural inheritance. You will have to face these consequences. And they will either defeat you or uplift you, depending upon how you respond, depending upon whether you respond with Knowledge or with idealism, compromise and greed. One leads to cooperation and unity. The other leads to conflict and breakdown.</p>
<p>正在降临世界的变革巨浪代表着自然的回应，代表着你们违背自然、挥霍你们自然遗产的后果。你们将不得不面对这些后果。它们要么击败你们，要么提升你们，这取决于你们如何回应，取决于你们是用内识还是用理想主义、妥协和贪婪来回应。前者通向合作与团结。后者通向冲突与崩溃。</p>
<p>This is not simply a matter for governments or policy. It has to do with how you see the world and how you respond to the world. It has to do with whether you are being guided by Knowledge or by all the other things that are the substitutes for Knowledge.</p>
<p>这不仅仅是政府或政策的问题。它关乎你如何看待世界，如何回应世界。它关乎你是否受到内识的指引，还是受到所有其他内识替代品的指引。</p>
<p>Your relationship with nature, then, is not simply one of admiring its beauty and its complexity. It really has to do with how you live in nature, how you work with nature. If your relationship with nature is to be more than a romance—more than romancing nature, being infatuated with its beauty—you have to deal with how you are going live with nature and in nature, and to deal with its adversities and to enjoy its splendors in a working relationship. And how are you going to deal with other people and the differences with other people?</p>
<p>那么，你与自然的关系并非仅仅是欣赏它的美丽和复杂性。它真正关乎你如何在自然中生活，如何与自然共事。如果你与自然的关系不仅仅是浪漫——不仅仅是对自然的浪漫情怀，不仅仅是沉迷于它的美——你就必须思考如何与自然共处，如何在自然中生活，如何应对它的逆境，如何在共事中享受它的壮丽。你又将如何与他人相处，如何应对与他人的差异？</p>
<p>God has placed an answer within you. It is not an answer that is an idea alone. It is an intelligence. The more humanity becomes strong with Knowledge, the more it restrains itself from its destructive behavior, and the more it fosters and creates behavior and technology and systems of social justice that are to its benefit.</p>
<p>上帝已经将一个答案置于你的内在。它并非仅仅是一个想法的答案。它是一种智能。人类的内识越强大，它就越能克制它自己，避免其破坏性行为，就越能培育和创造对其有益的行为、科技和社会正义体系。</p>
<p>For eventually humanity will have to outgrow its adolescent emphasis on growth and focus on stability and security as its primary focus. This is what all the races in the universe evolve to do. They go through their stages of growth, which usually leads to a kind of overreaching of their resources, sometimes even to destroy civilizations. But eventually they have to determine how they are going to be stable within their environment.</p>
<p>因为人类最终必须摆脱青春期对成长的过度关注，转而将稳定和安全作为首要关注点。宇宙中所有种族的进化目标都是如此。他们经历各自的成长阶段，这通常会导致某种程度的资源过度消耗，有时甚至会毁灭文明。但最终，他们必须确定如何在自身环境中保持稳定。</p>
<p>This is a very great thing. This is what the evolution of civilization really means. It is like the stages of life in a person’s life. When you are young, you want to grow and expand. You want to have more things. You want new experiences. You keep growing and expanding, growing and expanding. But if you are to become functional in a mature environment, as a mature individual, you will have to create stability. If you are to have a family, you must have stability and security. It is not so much about having new things all the time or being wild and free. Now you must attend to your basic responsibilities. You seek stability, security. This is natural.</p>
<p>这是一件非常伟大的事情。这才是文明进化的真正意义所在。它就像人生的各个阶段。年轻的时候，你想要成长和发展。你想要拥有更多的东西。你想要新的体验。你不断地成长、发展、发展。但如果你想在一个成熟的环境中发挥作用，成为一个成熟的个体，你就必须创造稳定性。如果你想要一个家庭，你必须拥有稳定和安全感。这并不是说要一直拥有新的东西，或者放纵自己、自由自在。现在你必须履行你的基本责任。你寻求稳定和安全感。这是自然而然的。</p>
<p>It does not mean that you are not still fascinated in life and enjoying life and open to change. It simply means that you have to attend to your responsibilities of living and sustaining what you have created.</p>
<p>它并不意味着你不再对生命充满热情、不再享受生命、不再愿意接受改变。它仅仅意味着你必须承担起你的责任，去生活，去维护你所创造的一切。</p>
<p>Eventually, humanity’s civilization, even facing a very degraded world, will have to come to terms with this. But still adolescent behavior permeates human cultures, permeates your economic systems, permeates political agendas, everything. You want more and more and more and more, but you are out of sync. You do not have a stable relationship with nature, or with each other.</p>
<p>最终，即使面对一个极其堕落的世界，人类文明也必须接受这一点。然而，青少年行为仍然渗透到人类文化、经济体系、政治议程以及方方面面。你们渴望更多，却与时俱进。你们与自然，以及彼此之间，都缺乏稳定的关系。</p>
<p>It is all about personal fulfillment, personal acquisition, personal wealth, personal happiness—all creating great instability. The real wealth, the real happiness, will be attained by other means.</p>
<p>一切都关乎个人成就、个人收获、个人财富、个人幸福——所有这些都造成了巨大的不稳定。真正的财富，真正的幸福，将通过其他途径获得。</p>
<p>God has placed Knowledge within you to guide you and to protect you and to teach you how to live in harmony with your environment and with each other. It is oriented to the truth, to what is real and genuine and authentic, what is honest and what is compassionate. It is your relationship with your deeper nature that will enable you to re-establish a real functioning relationship with the natural world—to restore a sustainable life, a balanced life. Even facing the Great Waves of change, Knowledge will lead you and guide you and help you navigate the difficult times ahead.</p>
<p>上帝将内识置于你的内在，来指引你、保护你，并教导你如何与你的环境以及彼此和谐相处。它面向真理，面向真实、实际和真诚，面向诚实和同情心。正是你与你更深层次自然的关系，将使你能够重建与自然世界的一种真正运转的关系——去重建一种可持续的生命，一种平衡的生命。即使面对变革的巨浪，内识也将引领你、指引你，并帮助你渡过前方的艰难时期。</p>
<p>There will have to be much human innovation in the future, but if it is guided by Knowledge, it will be beneficial. You will have to alter the circumstances of your life to adapt to a world of declining resources, but Knowledge will give you the strength to do this, and you will reap rewards as a result.</p>
<p>未来人类必将迎来许多创新，但如果它受到内识的指引，它将是有益的。你必须改变你的人生境遇，以适应一个资源日益减少的世界，但内识将赋予你力量去做到这一点，你也将因此收获回报。</p>
<p>You may face the future with great fear and anxiety, but Knowledge within you is not afraid. Knowledge’s only concern is that you will not recognize and fulfill your greater purpose for being in the world at this time. That is an underlying concern. But beyond this, Knowledge is not threatened by the things that frighten you, and that is why it represents your strength.</p>
<p>你或许带着巨大的恐惧和焦虑面对未来，但你内在的内识并不害怕。内识唯一的担忧是，你无法认知并实现你此刻身处世界的更伟大目的。这是一个潜在的担忧。但除此之外，内识并不受那些令你恐惧的事物的威胁，正因如此，它代表着你的力量。</p>
<p>It is your deeper nature. Neglect this to your own peril. Avoid this, you will face calamity. You will be unknown to yourself, and you will be without wisdom in the world. That is why returning to Knowledge is the foundation of all of your beneficial activities.</p>
<p>它是你更深层次的自然。忽视这一点，你将自食其果。逃避这一点，你将面临灾难。你将不知道你自己，你将在世上缺乏智慧。正因如此，回归内识是你所有有益活动的基础。</p>
<p>There will have to be a thousand things to be done to restore your balance with nature and to prevent calamity in the future for the human family, but the foundation of all of this must be Knowledge, your deeper nature.</p>
<p>必须做千万件事来恢复你们与自然的平衡，并防止人类大家庭在未来遭受的灾难，但所有这一切的基础必须是内识，你更深层次的自然。</p>
<p>There will be many arguments against this, of course: “Yes, but this,” “Yes, but that.” People will complain. They think it is inadequate. “Hah, you’re just going to rely upon some kind of intuition?” They think Knowledge is just intuition, a weak and fleeting experience. They do not take it seriously. They do not recognize its power, its immense strength.</p>
<p>当然，会有很多反对的声音：“是的，但是这样”，“是的，但是那样”。人们会抱怨。他们认为这不够充分。“哈，你只是要依赖某种直觉吗？”他们认为内识只是直觉，一种虚弱而短暂的体验。他们不把它当回事。他们没有认识到它的力量，它极大的实力。</p>
<p>People still think it is all about technology and innovation, but they cannot agree. They argue with each other over which political system is better, which social system is better. The arguments go on and on and permeate all of human culture—the disagreements, the conflicts. People fight with each other over innumerable things—with wars of words, wars of action and, in extreme cases, war itself.</p>
<p>人们仍然认为一切都关乎科技和创新，但他们却无法达成共识。他们争论哪种政治制度更好，哪种社会制度更好。这些争论永无休止，渗透到整个人类文化——分歧、冲突。人们为了无数的事情互相争斗——口水战、行动战，在极端情况下，甚至爆发战争。</p>
<p>But within you is a great power that is not in conflict with itself. You cannot be at war with another at the level of Knowledge. You will recognize your mutual needs and will try to satisfy them or address them together. And even your different opinions about what may or may not work will be counteracted by the presence of Knowledge.</p>
<p>但你内在存在着一股伟大的力量，它并不与自身冲突。在内识层面，你无法与他人交战。你将认知你们共同的需求，并努力去满足它们，或共同应对它们。甚至你们对于什么可行或不可行持有的不同观点，也会被内识的存在所抵消。</p>
<p>You will commit yourself to solutions even if those solutions prove to be difficult to recognize and to achieve because you will be guided by Knowledge. You will restrain your behavior. Nations will restrain their behavior, if guided by Knowledge, if guided by people who are strong with Knowledge.</p>
<p>你将致力于解决方案，即使这些解决方案被证明难以认知和实现，因为你将受到内识的指引。你将约束你的行为。如果受到内识的指引，如果受到拥有强大内识的人的指引，国家也将约束他们的行为。</p>
<p>Natural disasters will occur. You will know how to prepare for them. But what must stop, what must be arrested is humanity’s abuse of its natural inheritance. What does this look like? you might ask.</p>
<p>自然灾害将会发生。你们会知道如何应对。但必须制止、必须阻止的是人类对自然遗产的滥用。你可能会问，这会是什么样子？</p>
<p>Half the world’s forests should be preserved. Fuel should be rationed. It should have been rationed twenty years ago. You will have to control human population growth and human consumption if you are ever able to attain stability and security. You cannot devour the Earth without losing the ability to live here. And you cannot migrate to other planets because they are owned by others. Beyond this solar system, it is private property. You must put your house in order, and God has given you the power, the strength and the wisdom to do this.</p>
<p>世界上一半的森林应该得到保护。燃料应该实行定量配给。这早在二十年前就应该实行了。如果你们能够实现稳定与安全，就必须控制人口的增长和人类的消费。你们不能去吞噬地球，否则就会失去在这里生存的能力。你们也无法移民到其他星球，因为那些星球是其他种族的。太阳系之外，一切都是私有财产。你们必须安顿好自己的家园，上帝已经赋予你们力量、实力和智慧来做到这一点。</p>
<p>You have to begin with taking the Steps to Knowledge and with re-evaluating your life. Before you commit yourself to other actions, you must do this, or you will not have a foundation, and you will not be able to experience the source of your wisdom, your power and your strength. You will launch yourself on some kind of campaign of reform, but you will not really have the power and the strength and the wisdom that you will need to be successful.</p>
<p>你必须从开展内识进阶并重新评估你的生命开始。在你承诺其他行动之前，你必须这样做，否则你将没有一个基础，你将无法体验你的智慧、你的力量和你实力的源泉。你将发起某种改革运动，但你将不会真正拥有你成功所需的力量、实力和智慧。</p>
<p>For that, you must come to Knowledge within yourself. That is where you must begin. You begin with what is essential and fundamental. You learn to be still so you can experience Knowledge and feel its presence and hear its guidance, so you can feel its restraint and its motivations. You step out of the world of overstimulation into a deeper, more quiet world within yourself. And you will find that there is a greater strength within you waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>为此，你必须走向你内在的内识。那是你必须开始的地方。你从根本和根基之处开始。你学习静心，这样你就能体验内识，感受它的存在，聆听它的指引，这样你就能感受到它的克制和它的动机。你走出过度刺激的世界，进入你内在一个更深层次、更宁静的世界。你将会发现，你内在有一种更伟大的力量正等待着被发现。</p>
