<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on October 11, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 10 月 11 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many people in the world have been living beyond their means, and many people in the world barely have enough to live on. So this is creating a great unstable situation.</p>
<p>在世界上有许多人入不敷出，许多人生活拮据，这造成了极大的不稳定。</p>
<p>People who are living in the wealthy nations are encouraged to spend and to consume, to expand their lives, to own more things, to have more obligations, but in reality they cannot really afford this. And so they become overextended, and then life presents unanticipated events—illnesses, other problems, expenses that were unforeseen.</p>
<p>富裕国家的人们被鼓励挥霍消费，追求生活品质，拥有更多的东西，承担更多的责任，但实际上他们根本负担不起。于是他们变得过度消费，然后生活中就会出现意想不到的事件——疾病、其他问题、无法预见的开支。</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there has been a raft of corruption and mismanagement, driving whole nations into greater economic instability. So now there is a decline and a contraction.</p>
<p>与此同时，腐败和管理不善现象猖獗，导致整个国家陷入更大的经济不稳定。因此，现在出现了衰退和萎缩。</p>
<p>From a sensible point of view, this is understandable. If you live beyond your means or you try to earn wealth without real labor, without producing things of value, then you will end up in jeopardy and even calamity.</p>
<p>从理性角度来看，这是可以理解的。如果你入不敷出，或者试图不付出真正的劳动、不生产有价值的东西就赚取财富，那么你最终会陷入危险，甚至灾难。</p>
<p>Economies of the world are based on growth, but you are hitting the boundaries of growth, for you are facing a world of declining resources, a world of changing and violent weather, a world where food production and the availability of water will diminish, a world where a growing humanity will have to drink from a slowly shrinking well.</p>
<p>世界经济以增长为基础，但你们正在触及增长的界限，因为你们正面临着一个资源日益减少的世界，一个气候变化无常的世界，一个粮食产量和水资源供应将减少的世界，一个日益增长的人类不得不从一口逐渐萎缩的井中饮水的世界。</p>
<p>The emphasis now cannot be on growth and expansion and profiting off of this. It must be on stability and security.</p>
<p>现在的重点不能放在增长、扩张和从中获利上，而必须放在稳定和安全上。</p>
<p>The world is no longer a frontier where you can move to fresh pastures once you have depleted the land you are on now. There are still resources in the world, yes, but they will be harder to find, and there will be more competition for them.</p>
<p>世界不再是一片边疆，不再是当你们耗尽现有土地后就可以迁往新牧场的地方。没错，世界上仍然有资源，但这些资源将更加难以寻觅，竞争也将更加激烈。</p>
<p>People are trying to have unearned wealth, the few people who have this opportunity. But it is further destabilizing the human family. And now you are facing a financial contraction and corrections of a very severe magnitude.</p>
<p>人们试图不劳而获，少数人拥有这样的机会。但这进一步破坏了人类大家庭的稳定。现在，你们正面临一场极其严重的金融收缩和调整。</p>
<p>But there are more financial storms to come as humanity faces the reality of diminishing resources, escalating the cost of everything. What will you do when petroleum becomes three times as expensive as it is today? How will your nations function? How will people get around? What kind of businesses can survive in that environment?</p>
<p>然而，随着人类面临资源日益减少、物价不断攀升的现实，更多的金融风暴即将来临。当石油价格上涨到今天的三倍时，你们该怎么办？你们的国家将如何运转？人们将如何出行？什么样的企业能够在这样的环境下生存？</p>
<p>These are financial storms to come, and they are already here because they are driving the price of everything beyond the limits of what the poorer people can afford, and are affecting many people even in the wealthy nations. What will you do when food is twice as expensive as it is at this moment? It will be a financial storm.</p>
<p>金融风暴即将来临，而且它们已经到来，因为它们正在推高所有商品的价格，超出了贫困人口的承受能力，甚至影响到富裕国家的许多人。当食品价格比现在高出一倍时，你会怎么做？它将是一场金融风暴。</p>
<p>Many people cannot face the reality that they are living in a world of declining resources where there are boundaries to growth and expansion.</p>
<p>许多人无法面对这样的现实：他们生活在一个资源日益减少、增长和扩张受到限制的世界。</p>
<p>People are living in debt. Nations are functioning in debt. That is not a stable environment. That in itself will produce financial storms.</p>
<p>人们生活在债务之中。国家在债务中运转。这不是一个稳定的环境。这本身就会引发金融风暴。</p>
<p>What will happen when regions of the world dry out so much that people cannot live there and must migrate to other nations that are already full of peoples? These nations will break down into war and conflict. More financial storms. More uncertainty. More fear. More flight. It is only the beginning.</p>
<p>当世界上某些地区严重干旱，人们无法生存，不得不迁徙到其他人口稠密的国家时，会发生什么？这些国家将陷入战争和冲突。更多的金融风暴。更多的不确定性。更多的恐惧。更多的逃亡。它仅仅是个开始。</p>
<p>You will have brief periods of resurgence and renewal, but they will be brief, you see, because people have not faced the reality that they are living in a declining world. They still think it is all about economic policy. They still think it is all about what goes on in the marketplace, the marketplace that assumes that resources are unlimited, that it is all a matter of negotiation and policy.</p>
<p>你们会经历短暂的复苏和复兴时期，但你看，他们只会是短暂的，因为人们还没有正视他们生活在一个正在衰落的世界的现实。他们仍然认为一切都与经济政策有关。他们仍然认为一切都与市场运作有关，而市场假设资源是无限的，一切都是谈判和政策的问题。</p>
<p>But this is a fantasy. And it will be eclipsed by the reality that you are living in a world whose resources are being overstretched, and that there are many people in the world today who do not have enough and will not have enough. And so the excess wealth that is created anywhere must now be given to them to sustain them, to reinforce the stability and the survivability of human civilization.</p>
<p>但这只是幻想。而现实终将使这种幻想黯然失色：你们生活在一个资源过度紧张的世界，当今世界上许多人生活拮据，而且未来也不会满足。因此，任何地方创造的过剩财富现在都必须分配给他们，以维持他们的生计，巩固人类文明的稳定性和生存力。</p>
<p>It is not merely a question of losing your personal investments. It is a question of the stability and the survivability of human civilization.</p>
<p>它不仅仅是失去个人投资的问题，而是关系到人类文明的稳定性和生存能力的问题。</p>
<p>When you begin to meet the limits that the world sets down, it is a very important threshold because you must reconsider how you live—thoroughly evaluate how you live, how you travel, where you work.</p>
<p>当你开始遇到世界设定的限制时，它是一个非常重要的门槛，因为你必须重新考虑你的生活方式——彻底评估你的生活方式、你的旅行方式、你的工作地点。</p>
<p>Is your work going to be sustained into the future? Do you have a career that represents the [production] of essential goods and services? Can your work or career be viable in the future when people will have very little money to spend and will be emphasizing essential things?</p>
<p>你的工作能持续到未来吗？你的职业是否与生产生活必需品和服务相关？当人们的支出减少，生活必需品成为主流时，你的工作或职业还能生存下去吗？</p>
<p>What will dictate the future is food, fuel and water. These will predominate, and in many places will be the deciding factors.</p>
<p>决定未来的是食物、燃料和水。这些将占据主导地位，在许多地方将是决定性因素。</p>
<p>People in the wealthy nations cannot simply continue to splurge and carry on their buying spree, heedless of the future, heedless of the consequences. It will change the landscape entirely. It will change the structure of your economies. It will change your political priorities. It will change the focus and priorities of people living in cities and in the country—the emphasis now being on stability and security. People’s freedoms will be diminished simply because they will not have the resources to indulge themselves as they did before.</p>
<p>富裕国家的人民不能只是继续挥霍无度，继续疯狂购物，不顾未来，不顾后果。它将彻底改变格局。它将改变你们的经济结构。它将改变你们的政治优先事项。它将改变城市和乡村居民的关注点和优先事项——现在的重点是稳定和安全。人们的自由将被削弱，仅仅是因为他们不再拥有像以前那样放纵他们自己的资源。</p>
<p>It will be one financial storm after another, with perhaps brief intervals of seeming stability. But the Great Waves of change are coming, and there are many of them.</p>
<p>金融风暴将会接踵而至，或许会经历短暂的稳定期。但变革的巨浪即将到来，而且会有很多次。</p>
<p>Do not think that when you get through this crisis, it will all be fine again, and humanity can continue its overconsumption of the world, like locusts upon the land, consuming everything in sight, degrading the very world that sustains you and that gives you life.</p>
<p>不要认为，当你度过这场危机时，一切都会好起来，人类可以继续过度消耗世界，就像蝗虫袭击大地一样，吞噬眼前的一切，破坏这个养育你、给予你生命的世界。</p>
<p>Therefore, in the financial storms you are experiencing currently, take this as a sign of things to come. Take this as an indicator that you must reconsider how you live, your work, your relationships, your priorities, your interests and so forth.</p>
<p>因此，在你目前正在经历的金融风暴中，请将其视为未来事件的征兆。将其视为一个指标，表明你必须重新思考你的生活方式、你的工作、你的人际关系、你的优先事项、你的兴趣等等。</p>
<p>In the future, people will have very little money to spend, so what will be essential for them? You cannot live on credit. That will not last very long.</p>
<p>未来人们的钱会越来越少，什么对他们来说才是必需的呢？你无法靠信用生活。这种情况不会持续太久。</p>
<p>The whole environment of exchange of goods and services will have to change into a different kind of stability, but it will be far different from what people expect and are accustomed to today in the wealthy nations.</p>
<p>整个商品和服务交换环境必须转变为一种不同的稳定环境，但它将与当今富裕国家的人们所期望和习惯的环境大不相同。</p>
<p>The wealthy nations will function more like the poorer nations in many ways. There will be great unemployment as people will be thrown out of work because the work will not be needed, or the work will not be affordable, or the work will be seen as unnecessary.</p>
<p>富裕国家在许多方面将更像贫穷国家。大量失业将会出现，因为人们将失去工作，因为这些工作不再需要，或者负担不起，或者人们认为这些工作没有必要。</p>
<p>The chaos this will produce in the interim can be very significant. Not only will there be financial storms, there will be social unrest, disorder particularly in large cities. Government services will be cut. The value of currencies will diminish. It will be frightening at times.</p>
<p>在此期间，这将造成非常严重的混乱。不仅会引发金融风暴，还会引发社会动荡，尤其是在大城市，社会秩序将混乱。政府服务将被削减。货币将贬值。这有时会令人恐惧。</p>
<p>But what this is telling you right now: It is telling you to simplify your life, to limit your possessions, to conserve your resources, to get out of debt and such encumbrances; to reconsider your work, your transportation; to try to reorganize your life and to bring your family or your association of friends into a deeper kind of focus, a focus on the guiding power of Knowledge within yourselves.</p>
<p>但现在它正在告诉你：它正在告诉你简化你的生命，限制你的财产，保存你的资源，摆脱债务和类似的负担；重新考虑你的工作、你的交通；努力重新组织你的生命，并让你的家人或你的朋友关系进入一种更深层次的专注，专注于你内在内识的指引力量。</p>
<p>Everything around you will appear to be increasingly unstable and unreliable. People will lose faith in their governments, their economic systems, in leaders and institutions.</p>
<p>你周围的一切似乎都变得越来越不稳定和不可靠。人们将对政府、经济体系、领导人和机构失去信心。</p>
<p>They must return to the power and presence of Knowledge, the deeper Mind that God has put within them to guide them, to protect them and to enable them to navigate the difficult and uncertain times ahead.</p>
<p>他们必须回归内识的力量和存在，回归上帝放置在他们内在的更深层次的心灵，以指引他们、保护他们并使他们能够驾驭未来的艰难和不确定的时期。</p>
<p>Here your resources—your financial resources, your energy resources, even the resources of your relationships—become very important and cannot be wasted.</p>
<p>在此你的资源——你的财务资源，你的能量资源，甚至你的关系资源——变得非常重要，不能被浪费。</p>
<p>Of course, there will be increasing numbers of people in need—without homes, without jobs, without any foundation. They will have to be provided for too.</p>
<p>当然，会有越来越多的人陷入困境——无家可归、没有工作、没有任何基础。他们也需要得到帮助。</p>
<p>This will be a convulsive set of changes, and they will come in stages. But the greatest waves of change will have to do with resource depletion, for this creates a very great risk of competition and war. This will drive up the price of everything.</p>
<p>这将是一系列剧烈的变革，并将分阶段发生。但最大的变革浪潮将与资源枯竭有关，因为这将带来巨大的竞争和战争风险。这将推高所有商品的价格。</p>
<p>People will have to start growing their own food wherever they can and supporting local commerce wherever they can.</p>
<p>人们必须开始尽可能地种植他们自身的食物，并尽可能地支持当地的商业。</p>
<p>All those industries that are based upon travel and tourism will shrink or, in some cases, disappear altogether as people are unable to go abroad like that.</p>
<p>由于人们无法出国，所有以旅行和旅游业为基础的行业将会萎缩，或者在某些情况下完全消失。</p>
<p>The very wealthy will be preyed upon by vast numbers of people who hate them and resent them. Crime will increase. It will be very difficult.</p>
<p>非常富有的人将会被大量憎恨他们、怨恨他们的人所掠夺。犯罪将会增加。情况将变得非常艰难。</p>
<p>Even at this moment, the world is telling you certain things. It is giving you signs and messages. And Knowledge, the deeper Intelligence within you, is giving you signs and messages. Instead of frantically running around—frustrated, fearful, panicking—you must settle down and pay attention.</p>
<p>即便此刻，世界也在告诉你某些事情。它正在给你迹象与讯息。而内识，你内在更深层次的智能，也在给你迹象与讯息。与其疯狂地四处奔波——沮丧、恐惧、恐慌——不如安顿下来，集中注意力。</p>
<p>Listen to what the world is telling you. Sense what is coming over the horizon. Listen to what you know you must do in your own life.</p>
<p>聆听世界正在告诉你什么。感受地平线上即将发生的事情。聆听你生命中必须做的事情。</p>
<p>God has placed great power within you. It is not here to give you what you want. It is not here to fulfill your dreams. It is not here to serve your fantasies. It is here to guide you and protect you and lead you to a greater service to others. It is prepared for the Great Waves of change. In fact, you have been sent into the world to live at this time of great change.</p>
<p>上帝已经将伟大的力量放置在你的内在。它并非在此给予你你想要的东西。它并非在此实现你的梦想。它并非在此服务于你的空想。它在此指引你、保护你，并引领你去服务他人。它已为变革的巨浪做好了准备。事实上，你被派到这个世界，是为了生活在这个巨变的时期。</p>
<p>Be very tolerant of others. Do not cast blame about. Everyone has been a part of creating the storms, the financial storms that are affecting everyone. Certain people are more responsible than others, certainly, but take all of this energy that you would expend in blaming others, in raging against the governments, in raging against other nations, and bring it into your preparation for living in a different kind of world. Do not waste your time and energy in condemnation, for it will give you nothing and will only make you weaker and interfere with your ability to prepare for a future that will be unlike the past.</p>
<p>对他人要宽容。不要责怪他人。每个人都参与了这场风暴的制造，这场影响每个人的金融风暴。当然，有些人的责任更大，但请把你用来责怪他人、怒斥政府、攻击其他国家的精力，都用来为生活在一个不同的世界做准备。不要把你的时间和精力浪费在谴责上，因为这不会给你带来任何好处，只会让你变得更加虚弱，并妨碍你为一个与过去截然不同的未来做好准备的能力。</p>
<p>In the future, economies will have to be based upon stability. You will not be able to profit off of growth, as is the emphasis now. There will not be an emphasis on unearned wealth, as there is now. You cannot speculate endlessly, as it is occurring now.</p>
<p>未来，经济必须建立在稳定的基础之上。你将无法像现在强调的那样，从增长中获利。你也不会像现在这样，强调不劳而获的财富。你也不能像现在这样，无休止地投机。</p>
<p>Financial systems will have to be simple and transparent. If they are clever and deceptive, it will only breed further instability and breakdown. Attempts will be made, of course, to speculate endlessly with clever devices—people seeking unearned wealth, fabulous wealth, all trying to protect what they have. They will attempt to do this through clever and deceptive means, but it will only create further financial storms.</p>
<p>金融体系必须简单透明。如果它们狡猾且充满欺骗，只会滋生进一步的不稳定和崩溃。当然，人们会试图用各种巧妙的手段进行无休止的投机——他们追求不劳而获的财富、巨额财富，所有人都试图保护他们的财富。他们会试图通过狡猾和欺骗的手段来做到这一点，但这只会引发更多的金融风暴。</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the public is exhausted. It cannot afford anymore. It cannot go into debt anymore. It is falling apart.</p>
<p>与此同时，公众已经精疲力竭。他们再也负担不起了。他们无法再负债。他们正在分崩离析。</p>
<p>The wealthy had best contribute most of their wealth to social welfare here because otherwise you will have revolution. The wealthy will be preyed upon, and there will be little to protect them.</p>
<p>富人最好把大部分财富捐献给这里的社会福利，否则就会发生革命。富人会被掠夺，而且几乎没有什么可以保护他们。</p>
<p>It is a very difficult environment, but it is an environment where real service to others will be called for. It will be an environment of service. It will require sacrifice. It will require sobriety. It will require tremendous honesty.</p>
<p>它是一个非常艰难的环境，但也是一个需要真正服务他人的环境。它是一个服务他人的环境。它需要牺牲。它需要清醒。它需要无比的诚实。</p>
<p>Your nation is going to have to pitch in—everyone—as if you were at war. Hopefully you will not be at war, but you will be fighting the very circumstances that you have created that are now undermining the fabric and stability of civilization.</p>
<p>你们的国家——所有人——都必须全力投入，就像你们身处战场一样。希望你不会卷入战争，但你将要对抗的正是你们自己创造的、正在破坏文明结构和稳定的环境。</p>
<p>Instead of personal enrichment, it will really have to be collective survival. For towns and cities, communities, states and nations, the collective well-being, stability and security will become the emphasis because you are facing the Great Waves of change, which are all converging now, creating currents and cross currents that will be so confusing and have so many impacts that they cannot be accurately predicted.</p>
<p>与其说是个人致富，不如说是集体生存。对于城镇、社区、城邦和国家来说，集体福祉、稳定和安全将成为重点，因为你们正面临变革的巨浪，它们现在正在汇聚，形成着如此令人困惑、如此影响深远以至于无法准确预测的潮流和交叉潮流。</p>
<p>Of course, you are looking at a series of financial storms of an unprecedented nature, unlike anything that has ever happened to humanity before. That is why the past cannot be a complete reference here because in the past, the world always had great and boundless resources. But now the world does not have great and boundless resources.</p>
<p>当然，你正在目睹一系列前所未有的金融风暴，这与人类历史上任何时期都不同。正因如此，过去并非一个完整的参照，因为过去，世界总是拥有巨大而取之不尽的资源。但现在，世界不再拥有巨大而取之不尽的资源。</p>
<p>Changing climate will destroy much of your agricultural productivity, and once you begin to run out of fuels, then food production will become a grave and overarching problem.</p>
<p>气候变化将摧毁大部分农业生产力，一旦燃料开始耗尽，粮食生产将成为一个严重而首要的问题。</p>
<p>The difficulties that are occurring today in the financial world are but the prelude for greater events. Therefore, instead of thinking that you must weather a storm, you really have to rethink your position overall and to see that the circumstances and the environment for life in this world are changing. The priorities will be changing amidst the background of rising instability and upheaval.</p>
<p>当今金融界的困境只是更大事件的前奏。因此，与其想着必须渡过难关，不如真正重新思考你们的整体处境，并认识到这个世界的境况和生存环境正在发生改变。在动荡和动荡加剧的背景下，优先事项也将随之改变。</p>
<p>Live simply. Own only the minimum of what you need. Relieve yourself of unnecessary possessions. Focus your work on essential goods and services. Support your local commerce, and learn to get around without the use of an automobile to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p>生活简单。只拥有最低限度的必需品。放弃不必要的物品。专注于必需品和服务。支持当地商业，并尽可能学会不使用汽车出行。</p>
<p>Most importantly here is to build your connection with Knowledge, for this is how God will guide you and speak to you. But connecting with Knowledge requires real maturity, honesty and discernment, for you can think that anything that comes into your mind is Knowledge, anything that comes into your mind is the truth. But your mind is full of error, and the world is full of error. So how will you know that what you are hearing is really true?</p>
<p>这里最重要的是构建你与内识的联接，因为这是上帝将指引你、对你讲话的方式。但是与内识的联接需要真正的成熟、坦诚和辨识力，因为你可以认为任何进入你心灵的事情都是内识，任何进入你心灵的东西都是真理。但是你的心灵充满了错误，世界充满了错误。那么你如何知道你听到的实际上是真的呢？</p>
<p>You will know through experience the difference between something that is genuine and authentic and something that is merely a wish, a hope or a fear. Experience will show you the great difference between these two experiences.</p>
<p>你会通过体验，知道哪些是真挚而真实的，哪些只是愿望、希望或恐惧。体验会让你知道这两种经历之间的巨大差异。</p>
<p>God has given you a compass, a guide to navigate the difficult and unpredictable times ahead. But you must come out of denial. You must stop insisting that the world is going to be the way you want it to be and that the future will be like a past that you imagine to be so wonderful. You must be clear. You must be discerning. You cannot be governed by greed or fear if you are to see and know anything. You must be resourceful, but ethical as well. And you must have the courage to face great upheaval and great discouragement.</p>
<p>上帝已赐予你指南针，指引你渡过未来艰难而不可预知的时光。但你必须摒弃否定。你必须停止坚持世界将会按照你所希望的方式发展，不再坚持未来会像你想象中那样美好。你必须清晰。你必须明辨是非。如果你想洞察一切，就不能被贪婪或恐惧所左右。你必须足智多谋，但也要有道德。你必须拥有勇气去面对巨大的动荡和巨大的挫折。</p>
<p>In truth, you were born to live in these times and to face the Great Waves of change. And God has sent a New Message into the world to warn humanity, to strengthen humanity and to prepare humanity for the Great Waves of change. God is sending Wisdom into the world unlike anything that has ever been given here before because humanity will need this now to face the turbulent times ahead.</p>
<p>事实上，你们生来就是为了生活在这个时代，为了面对变革的巨浪。上帝向世界发来了一个新讯息，以警示人类，强化人类，并帮助人类为变革的巨浪进行准备。上帝正在向世界发来智慧，它不同于以往任何被赋予的智慧，因为人类现在就需要它来面对未来的动荡时代。</p>
<p>After the initial shock and dismay, you must stop whining about the way things are and get to work securing your own life and assisting others. Endless complaint is only preventing you from attending to your own preparation and your own deep evaluation of your life.</p>
<p>在最初的震惊和沮丧之后，你必须停止抱怨现状，开始努力保障你自身的生命并帮助他人。无休止的抱怨只会阻碍你自身做好充分的准备，以及无法深入地评估你的生命。</p>
<p>Being in denial is foolish and self-destructive here, for the longer you wait to prepare and to re-evaluate your circumstances, the fewer will be your options, and the greater the jeopardy you will have to face as a result.</p>
<p>否认是愚蠢和自我毁灭的，因为你等待准备和重新评估情况的时间越长，你的选择就越少，你面临的危险就越大。</p>
<p>After initial shock and dismay, you must get serious about your life. Stop blaming others. Stop complaining. Stop whining. You must find your deeper strength in Knowledge. You must commit yourself to facing the great thresholds ahead. You must affirm that Knowledge is within you even if in the moment you cannot experience it.</p>
<p>在最初的震惊和沮丧之后，你必须认真对待你的生命。停止责怪他人。停止抱怨。停止牢骚。你必须在内识中找到你更深层次的实力。你必须承诺你自己去面对前方的伟大门槛。你必须确认内识就在你的内在，即使此刻你无法体验它。</p>
<p>God has sent Steps to Knowledge, the preparation, into the world to build a bridge between your social mind, which has been conditioned by the world, and the deeper Mind of Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>上帝已经将内识的进阶，即准备，发送到这个世界，以便在你被世界所制约的社会心灵和你内在更深层次的内识心灵之间建立一座桥梁。</p>
<p>Only Knowledge within you will know what to do in the difficult times ahead. While everyone around you is in panic, is outraged, or chaos exists around you, you must have this guiding light. You must abide with it. You must hold true to it. And you must honor this in others and call for this in others.</p>
<p>只有你内在的内识才能知道在未来的艰难时刻该做什么。当你周围的每个人都陷入恐慌、愤怒，或者你周围一片混乱时，你必须拥有这盏指路明灯。你必须坚守它。你必须忠于它。你必须尊重他人的这盏明灯，并呼吁他人的这盏明灯。</p>
<p>Follow leaders who demonstrate and exhibit the power and the presence of Knowledge, for many false leaders will arise in the difficult times ahead.</p>
<p>追随那些展现出内识的力量和存在的领导者，因为在未来的困难时期会出现许多虚假的领导者。</p>
<p>Your personal, social mind will feel helpless and hopeless and be outraged. It will try to reassert its values and its former priorities. But Knowledge within you will be quiet, for it is not driven by fear and hostility. While the surface of your mind may be turbulent, like the surface of the ocean being whipped up by the winds, deep down you will be quiet, certain.</p>
<p>你的个人心灵、社会的心灵将感到无助、绝望，并感到愤怒。它将试图重申它的价值观和它先前的优先事项。但你内在的内识将保持宁静，因为它不受恐惧和敌意的驱使。虽然你的心灵表面可能动荡不安，如同被风吹拂的海面，但在你的内心深处，你将保持平静和确定性。</p>
<p>Here being grounded in Knowledge is the most important thing, for you cannot plan for the future entirely. There will be so many changes happening. It will be so confusing because there are many Great Waves of change converging at this time and in the future. You cannot practically plan for everything. You cannot stockpile food for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>在这里，扎根于内识是最重要的，因为你无法完全规划未来。将会有如此多的变化发生。它将非常令人困惑，因为此时此刻以及未来，许多变革的浪潮汇聚在一起。你几乎无法规划所有事情。你无法为你的余生囤积食物。</p>
<p>You have to build as solid a foundation as possible, a sustainable foundation, and be very watchful and very careful. God has given you the power to do this. Even if you do not think you have this power now, this power is within you, and you must build a connection to it. The sooner you begin, the better will be your chances.</p>
<p>你必须建立尽可能坚实的基础，一个可持续的基础，并且保持高度警惕和谨慎。上帝赋予了你做到这一点的力量。即使你现在认为你还没有这种力量，但它就在你的内心，你必须与它建立联系。你越早开始，你的机会就越大。</p>
<p>The financial storms will continue, for they represent the recklessness and the irresponsibility and the false assumptions of people everywhere. Of course, they will fail. Of course, they will break down. Of course, you cannot profit immensely without driving your nation into future breakdown.</p>
<p>金融风暴将持续，因为它们体现了世界各地人们的鲁莽、不负责任和错误假设。当然，它们会失败。当然，它们会崩溃。当然，你不可能在不把你的国家推向未来崩溃的情况下获得巨额利润。</p>
<p>If you eat all the food in the pantry, there is none for tomorrow. If you spend all the money, there is none for tomorrow. You see the difference between greed and wisdom, between self-control and self-indulgence.</p>
<p>如果你把食品柜里的食物都吃光了，明天就没剩了。如果你把钱都花光了，明天就没剩了。你可以看见贪婪与智慧、自控与放纵之间的区别。</p>
<p>You will have to restrain your greed, your desires, and you will have to restrain your anger and your blame if you are to create any stability in your life. Stability and security will be the most important things.</p>
<p>如果你想在生命中创造任何稳定，你必须克制你的贪婪、欲望、愤怒和责备。稳定与安全才是最重要的。</p>
<p>You do not want your children to have to face a world in chaos. It is necessary to teach them to build a connection to Knowledge within themselves, just as you are learning to do so yourself.</p>
<p>你不希望你的孩子们面对一个混乱的世界。有必要教导他们在他们内在建立与内识的联接，就像你自己正在学习这样做一样。</p>
<p>Have good faith, for God has sent a New Message into the world to warn humanity of the great storms to come, to call on humanity to end its ceaseless conflicts and to unite to survive and to build a new foundation for the future.</p>
<p>要有良好的信仰，因为上帝已经向世界发送了一条新讯息，警告人类即将到来的巨大风暴，呼吁人类结束无休止的冲突，团结起来生存并为未来建立新的基础。</p>
<p>People will have to cooperate. Nations will have to cooperate. United, you have a chance. Divided, you will decline.</p>
<p>人民必须合作。国家必须合作。团结起来，你们就有机会。分裂，你们就会衰落。</p>
<p>If human civilization declines, other races from the universe will come to take this planet, as many are planning to do even now. Should humanity fail, should humanity weaken itself, they will come here. Some are here already. They will not use force, but persuasion. And who could resist their false promises of wealth and power if humanity were in a destitute state?</p>
<p>如果人类文明衰落，宇宙中的其他种族将会来占领这个星球，正如许多种族现在就计划的那样。如果人类失败，如果人类自身衰弱，他们就会来到这里。有些种族已经来了。他们不会使用武力，而是劝说。如果人类陷入贫困，谁能抵挡住他们关于财富和权力的虚假承诺呢？</p>
<p>Therefore, face the difficulties currently, and recognize they are giving you a sign and a message. Do not waste your time in blame and condemnation. Do not think that this is just a passing storm and that you will return to your former focus, for things are changing now permanently.</p>
<p>因此，请直面当前的困境，并认识到它们正在向你发出的信号和讯息。不要把时间浪费在责备和谴责上。不要认为这只是一场短暂的风暴，你很快就会回到之前的专注点，因为事情正在发生永久性的改变。</p>
<p>Learn of the Great Waves of change. Learn of the New Message that God has sent and its prophetic message about the Great Waves of change and about humanity’s contact with intelligent life in the universe.</p>
<p>学习变革的巨浪。学习上帝发送的新讯息，以及它关于变革的巨浪和人类与宇宙智能生命接触的预言。</p>
<p>Learn about the New Message and its teaching on The Way of Knowledge and the Steps to Knowledge, for only this deeper power in you will remain clear and focused in the future. And your intellect must follow it, for it will never follow your intellect.</p>
<p>学习新讯息及其关于内识之路和内识进阶的教程，因为唯有你内在的这种更深层次的力量，才能在未来保持清晰和专注。你的智力必须追随它，因为它永远不会追随你的智力。</p>
<p>Who you are is not your mind or your body, but a deeper spiritual Being, a deeper spiritual Intelligence, and this is Knowledge. This is what God has created in you, not what society has created in you. Your personality has been formed both by nature and by your environment. But this is a deeper nature, a nature that possesses profound Wisdom because God has put this Wisdom in you to guide you, to protect you and to lead you forward.</p>
<p>你并非你的心灵或你的身体，而是一个更深层次的精神存在，一个更深层次的精神智能，这就是内识。这是上帝在你内在创造的，而非社会在你内在创造的。你的人格既由自然塑造，也由你的环境塑造。但这是一种更深层次的自然，一种拥有深邃智慧的自然，因为上帝将这份智慧置于你内在，来指引你、保护你、引领你前行。</p>
<p>You were sent into the world to face these very times and circumstances and to give something unique to the world. For this, you will need certain relationships and certain opportunities. But most of all you will need the realization that there is a deeper reality within you, there is a deeper current of your life, and you have a true direction that you must discern that will be different from your wishes and your ambitions, your fascinations and your indulgences.</p>
<p>你被派到这个世界上，就是为了面对这样的时代和环境，并为这个世界带来一些独特的东西。为此，你将需要特定的关系和特定的机遇。但最重要的是，你将需要认识到，你内在有一个更深层次的现实，你的生命中有一股更深层次的潮流，你有一个你必须辨识的真正方向，它不同于你的愿望、你的野心、你的迷恋和你的放纵。</p>
<p>These times will serve you if you can respond to them, gain their insight, read their signs and messages and build a connection to Knowledge within yourself. Then you will see what is trustworthy and what is not, what is stable and what is not. Knowledge is with you no matter what because it represents your eternal life—in the world, right now, here and now, in these circumstances, whatever they may be.</p>
<p>如果你能回应它们，获得它们的洞见，解读它们的迹象和讯息，并在你内在构建与内识的联接，这些时间将对你有益。那时你将看到什么是值得信赖的，什么是不值得信赖的，什么是稳定的，什么是不稳定的。无论怎样，内识都与你同在，因为它代表着你的永恒生命——在世界上，在此时此刻，在当下这些境况中，无论它们是什么。</p>
<p>It is no accident this is happening. It has been foreseen by those who sent you into the world. Certainly, humanity would have to face the consequences of its overuse and misuse of the world and its own reckless behavior. Perhaps you have anticipated this yourself.</p>
<p>这一切并非偶然。那些将你送入这个世界的存在早已预见到了。人类当然必须面对它过度使用和滥用的世界，以及自身鲁莽行为的后果。或许你自己也预见到了这一点。</p>
<p>Therefore, do not think that life is being unfair to you or that God is punishing you, for God is not punishing you. You are punishing yourself, and you are punishing one another.</p>
<p>所以，不要认为生命对你不公平，或者上帝在惩罚你，因为上帝并没有惩罚你。你在惩罚你自己，也在惩罚彼此。</p>
<p>Therefore, learn from these times. Learn from these errors. Build your well of wisdom, without condemnation. You are here to serve the world, not to rape it. You are here to add to humanity’s stability and security, not to undermine it for your own personal advantages.</p>
<p>因此，要从这些时期汲取教训，从这些错误中汲取教训。构建你的智慧之井，不带任何谴责。你来到这个世界是为了服务世界，而非掠夺它。你来到这个世界是为了增进人类的稳定与安全，而非为了个人利益而破坏它。</p>
<p>Look at the very wealthy with pity, for they have lost contact with the power of Knowledge in so many ways. And those that have rediscovered Knowledge will naturally become benefactors for humanity, for anyone who has great wealth must become a benefactor to humanity. Some people were sent into the world to do just this. Everyone must serve the well-being of humanity, but this well-being is now being challenged as never before.</p>
<p>怜悯地看看那些富人，因为他们在很多方面都失去了与内识力量的联系。而那些重新发现内识的人，自然会成为人类的恩人，因为任何拥有巨额财富的人，都必须成为人类的恩人。有些人被派到这个世界上就是为了做这件事。每个人都必须服务于人类的福祉，但这种福祉如今正遭受着前所未有的挑战。</p>
<p>You must take a very different tack if you are to navigate the difficult waters ahead. You must see that you are here for a purpose, and this purpose has a destiny in this world—at this time, under these circumstances—and begin to adjust your life accordingly. You must accept that financial storms will continue and will even increase in magnitude and use this awareness to re-evaluate your circumstances, to allow Knowledge to guide you to where you need to be and to what you need to be doing.</p>
<p>如果你要渡过前方的艰难水域，你必须采取一种非常不同的策略。你必须看到你在此是为了一个目的，而这个目的在这个世界——在这个时间，在这些境况下——拥有一个天命，并开始相应地调整你的生命。你必须接受金融风暴将会持续，甚至会加剧，并运用这种觉知来重新评估你的境况，让内识指引你去往你需要去的地方，去往你需要去做的事情。</p>
<p>Do not hold on to the past here, for the world is changing, and you must move with it. That does not mean that you agree with everything [that happens]. Of course not. But it means that your life is moving. Do not hold on to people and places and things. Allow things to be in flux and to be rearranged. And if you cannot see clearly, then wait and watch. Be patient. Do not believe the proclamations that you hear around you, but listen for the truth of Knowledge in others.</p>
<p>别执着于过去，因为世界正在改变，你必须随之而动。这并不意味着你认同[发生的一切]。当然不是。但这意味着你的生命正在前进。别执着于人、地点和事物。允许事物不断变化，不断被重新排列。如果你看不清，那就等待和观察。保持耐心。不要相信你周围听到的宣告，而是聆听他人内在的内识真理。</p>
<p>Government leaders will try to reassure you, but how can they know what is really coming? Do not assume that they know this, for they may be as blind as anyone else.</p>
<p>政府领导人会尽力安抚你，但他们如何知道真正会发生什么呢？不要认为他们知道，因为他们可能和其他人一样盲目。</p>
<p>That is why the power of Knowledge is so important. It will not lead you to violence or to despair. It will not lead you to degradation. But it will lead you instead to a life of service, a life that has strength, a life that is stable, a life that can adapt to changing circumstances, a life that is strong and that cannot be overcome by the world.</p>
<p>正因为如此，内识的力量如此重要。它不会引领你走向暴力或绝望。它不会引领你走向堕落。相反，它会引领你走向一种服务的生命，一种拥有力量的生命，一种稳定的生命，一种能够适应变化境况的生命，一种强大且无法被世界征服的生命。</p>
<p>This is the great power that you must discover and follow. And this power you must discover and follow in others. It is consistent between people even though their experiences of it may be very different. Within itself, it is whole and complete.</p>
<p>这是你必须发现并追随的伟大力量。你必须在他人身上发现并追随这股力量。即使人们的体验可能截然不同，这股力量在人与人之间始终如一。它本身是完整而圆满的。</p>
<p>With Knowledge, you will have no enemies. You will simply see around you wisdom and ignorance. With Knowledge, you will be able to face change and adapt to change without succumbing to change. You will know where to draw the line regarding your own integrity and the compromises you might have to make. Knowledge knows where to draw these lines. You do not. Your intellect does not.</p>
<p>有了内识，你将不再有敌人。你将只会看到你周围的智慧和无知。有了内识，你将能够面对变化并适应变化，而不会屈服于变化。你将知道在哪里划定你自身完整性的界限，以及你可能不得不做出的妥协。内识知道在哪里划定这些界限。你不知道。你的智力不知道。</p>
<p>Do not pretend to be certain. Do not let blind optimism blind you. Do not let blind fear blind you. Let nothing blind you.</p>
<p>不要假装确定。不要让盲目的乐观蒙蔽了你的双眼。不要让盲目的恐惧蒙蔽了你的双眼。不要让任何事蒙蔽了你的双眼。</p>
<p>Without hope and without fear, you can see clearly, and you can see what you must do and what you must not do. It is this sobriety, this objectivity, that will make you strong and resilient.</p>
<p>抛开希望，抛开恐惧，你就能看得清清楚楚，看清什么该做，什么不该做。正是这份清醒，这份客观，才能让你变得坚强，坚韧。</p>
<p>But it must be compassionate as well, for there will be much suffering around you. This is a condition that will call forth your greater service to the world where it needs to be given and other people’s great service to the world where it needs to be given.</p>
<p>但它也必须是同情的，因为你周围将充满苦难。这种情况将唤起你对世界需要给予的更伟大服务，以及其他人对世界需要给予的更伟大服务。</p>
<p>[May] the power and the presence of Knowledge guide you and bless you, redeem you and restore you. And may you come to accept these times and to realize the great redemption that they can foster if they can be seen and responded to with the power of Knowledge.</p>
<p>愿内识的力量和存在指引你、祝福你、救赎你、重建你。愿你能够接受这些时期，并认识到如果它们能够被看见并用内识的力量去回应，它们能够孕育的伟大救赎。</p>
