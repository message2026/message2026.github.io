<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on June 8, 2010 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2010 年 6 月 8 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Living in the world, having a Divine origin and a Divine destiny, means that you are living in two different realities at once. Your spiritual reality will emerge later in life, once you have gained some maturity and have realized the limits of the world and your worldly existence. Before that, you were gaining a foothold in the world to attempt to become a functional human being in relationship with others, taking on the responsibilities and the difficulties of living in manifest reality.</p>
<p>生活在世界上，拥有神圣的起源和神圣的天命，意味着你同时生活在两个不同的现实中。你的精神现实将在你日后的生命中浮现，那时你已获得一定程度的成熟，并意识到了世界和你世俗存在的局限。在此之前，你正在世上站稳脚跟，努力成为一个能够与他人建立关系的正常人，承担起在显化现实中生活的责任和挑战。</p>
<p>For many people, this will occupy their entire existence here. And for a great many people they will be bound by poverty and oppression, never to discover their greater spiritual reality, never to discover the other side of their lives.</p>
<p>对许多人来说，这将占据他们在此的整个人生。对许多人来说，他们将被贫困和压迫所束缚，永远无法发现他们更伟大的精神现实，永远无法发现他们生命的另一面。</p>
<p>You are living in two different realities, for you have never left Creation. Even while you walk this world in seeming Separation, a distinct person with a distinct personality and identity, you are still part of Creation. You are still part of the Ancient Home that you left to come here, for you cannot leave Creation in truth.</p>
<p>你生活在两个不同的现实中，因为你从未离开过创造。即使你行走在这个世界，看似分离，是一个拥有独特个性和身份的独特个体，但你依然是创造的一部分。你依然是你离开而来此的古老家园的一部分，因为你无法在真理中离开创造。</p>
<p>So you have a mind for the world and you have a holy Mind, the Mind We call Knowledge. Knowledge is the part of you that never left, that is not living in Separation, that is still connected to God and Creation. For you could never really leave God and Creation, even to live in such a very different reality, as living in the world, as living in the physical reality.</p>
<p>所以你拥有一个关乎世界的心灵，你拥有一个神圣的心灵，我们称之为内识的心灵。内识是你从未离开创造的一部分，它并非生活在分离之中，它依然与上帝和创造相连。因为你永远无法真正离开上帝和创造，即便生活在一个如此截然不同的现实中，比如生活在这个世界之中，比如生活在物质现实中。</p>
<p>This is a mystery to you now, for you have assumed a worldly mind and a worldly perspective. And though you have your individual rendition of that, it is still very similar to everyone else’s, the differences here being not very great in reality.</p>
<p>现在这对你来说是个谜，因为你已经拥有了世俗的心灵和世俗的视角。虽然你对此有你的独特理解，但它仍然与其他人非常相似，实际上差异并不大。</p>
<p>So you have a manifest life and you have a mysterious life. What you need to know is that your mysterious life holds all of the meaning and value and purpose for you living in the manifest reality.</p>
<p>所以，你既有显化的生命，也有神秘的生命。你需要知道的是，你的神秘生命蕴含着你活在显化现实中的全部意义、价值和目的。</p>
<p>Try as you might, you cannot fulfill yourself out in the world. Being a worldly person, trying to achieve fulfillment or success, you can never satisfy the deeper part of you, your deeper nature. This can only be fulfilled by eventually recognizing the greater purpose that has brought you into the world—to accept this purpose and to follow it and to fulfill it.</p>
<p>无论你如何努力，你都无法在世上满足你自己。作为一个世俗之人，努力追求成就或成功，你永远无法满足你内心的更深处，你内心更深层次的自然。这唯有通过最终认知将你带到世间的更伟大目的——接受这个目的，遵循它，并成就它——才能实现。</p>
<p>This satisfies the need of the soul, the greatest and most profound need you have within you. For after you have satisfied the needs of the body and the needs of the mind, you come to the greatest need, the most fundamental need, the need that is driving you even at this moment.</p>
<p>这满足了灵魂的需求，你内在最伟大、最深刻的需求。因为在你满足了身体和心灵的需求之后，你就会面临最大的需求，最根本的需求，即使在此刻也驱动着你的需求。</p>
<p>The reason that this need exists within you is that you are here for a greater purpose. The deeper Mind within you, the Mind of Knowledge, knows this, of course, and is prepared to guide you and to protect you so that you can discover and fulfill this greater purpose.</p>
<p>你内在存在这种需求，是因为你在此是为了一个更伟大的目的。你内在更深层次的心灵，内识的心灵，当然知道这一点，并准备好指引你、保护你，以便你能够发现并成就这个更伟大的目的。</p>
<p>You cannot escape the fact that you have a dual nature. And you cannot leave one for the other. So many people try. You cannot leave the world to become an entirely spiritual person because you still have to take care of the affairs of your life. You are still in relationship with others and all the difficulties that they can produce. You still have the needs of the body. You are still a citizen of a nation. You are still engaged with the world.</p>
<p>你无法逃避拥有双重自然的现实。你无法舍弃其中一种而去追求另一种。许多人都在尝试。你无法离开这个世界，成为一个完全精神的人，因为你仍然需要照顾你的生命。你仍然与他人保持联系，并承受着他们可能制造的所有困难。你仍然需要满足身体的需求。你仍然是一个国家的公民。你仍然与世界息息相关。</p>
<p>Likewise, you cannot give up your spiritual reality to become a completely worldly person, or you will never have a real sense of your life and destiny. And you will never understand or be able to experience consistently the greater purpose that has brought you here.</p>
<p>同样，你无法放弃你的精神现实，成为一个彻底世俗的人，否则你永远无法真正感知你的生命和天命。你也永远无法理解或能够持续体验引领你来到此地的更伟大目的。</p>
<p>You will make all your decisions based upon your ideas or the ideas of your culture. You will be bound and chained to your culture. It, more than you, will dictate who you are with, what you will do, what you will value and what you will avoid. And you will not be a free person, even if you live in a free nation.</p>
<p>你所有的决定都将基于你的想法，或者你文化的想法。你将被你的文化所束缚和拴住。文化比你，更会决定你与谁为伍，你将做什么，你将珍视什么，以及你将避免什么。即使你生活在一个自由的国家，你也不会成为一个自由的人。</p>
<p>There is no avoiding your real spiritual nature and your worldly nature. Though they are entirely different, and you cannot unite them fully, you must accept the reality of both—a reality that is distinct within each realm. Here the mind of the world, your worldly mind, is very different from the Mind of Knowledge.</p>
<p>你无法回避你真正的精神自然和你的世俗自然。尽管它们截然不同，你无法将它们完全统一，但你必须接受两者的现实——一个在各自领域中都截然不同的现实。在这里，世界的心灵，你的世俗心灵，与内识的心灵截然不同。</p>
<p>Your worldly mind is weak and impressionable. It is subject to your desires and the priorities of your culture. It is constantly afraid of loss, afraid of disapproval, afraid of deprivation and afraid of death. It is driven by fear and desire. It knows not of what is true within you, and so it is subject to other powers. It is easily influenced and manipulated. It is easily seduced.</p>
<p>你的世俗心灵软弱而易受影响。它受制于你的欲望和你所在文化的优先次序。它始终害怕失去，害怕非议，害怕剥夺，害怕死亡。它被恐惧和欲望所驱使。它不知道你内在的真实，因此它受制于其他力量。它很容易受到影响和操纵。它很容易被诱惑。</p>
<p>Without Knowledge to guide it, it is weak but also dangerous and destructive. It needs a guiding hand. It was not meant to be a god. It was not meant to be your sole reality. It is really meant to serve the deeper Mind within you, to be a vehicle of expression for a greater reality, the Reality of God.</p>
<p>没有内识的指引，它是虚弱的，也是危险的、具有破坏性的。它需要一只指引之手。它并非注定要成为神。它并非注定要成为你唯一的现实。它真正的意义在于服务于你内在更深层次的心灵，成为一个更伟大现实——上帝现实——的表达载体。</p>
<p>Your personal mind cannot understand the Mind of Knowledge. It can only follow it and learn to work in harmony with Knowledge. The manifest cannot understand the Mystery, but the Mystery is the more powerful of the two.</p>
<p>你的个人心灵无法理解内识的心灵。它只能遵循它，并学习与内识和谐共事。显化无法理解神秘，但神秘的力量远胜于此。</p>
<p>All the great inventions, the great innovations, the great services to humanity, in all fields of endeavor, have come from the Mystery—the impulses from the Mystery, the guidance and direction from the Mystery. This is what has led unique individuals to do uncommon things, to act in a selfless manner, and to achieve things that others had neither thought of nor would seek to fulfill.</p>
<p>所有伟大的发明、伟大的创新、对人类的伟大服务，在所有努力的领域，都源于神秘——来自神秘的动力，来自神秘的指引和方向。正是这引领着独特的个体去做非凡之事，以无私的方式行事，并成就他人未曾想到、也不愿去追求的事情。</p>
<p>So people even in the wealthy nations live like slaves—slaves to the addictions of culture, slaves to their compromises, slaves to their own self-judgment, slaves to the dictates and requirements of their family and their communities. Though they may be adorned with beautiful things, inside they are unknown to themselves and know not of their greater purpose and destiny here. True accomplishment and fulfillment are deprived from them, and the greater need of the soul goes unfulfilled. And they are restless as a result.</p>
<p>因此，即使在富裕国家，人们也像奴隶一样生活——成为文化成瘾的奴隶，成为他们妥协的奴隶，成为他们自我评判的奴隶，成为他们家庭和社区指令和要求的奴隶。尽管他们可能被美丽的事物装饰着，但他们的内心却对自己一无所知，不知道他们在此的更伟大目的和天命。他们被剥夺了真正的成就和满足，灵魂的更伟大需求得不到满足。因此，他们焦躁不安。</p>
<p>This is why once you have satisfied the basic needs of the body and the mind, and you have established a position for yourself in the world, and can at least communicate with others at a fundamental level successfully, and can manage your affairs fundamentally, the deeper need of the soul begins to emerge and with it the mystery of your life.</p>
<p>这就是为什么一旦你满足了身体和心灵的基本需求，并且在世界上确立了你自己位置，并且至少能够在基本层面上与他人成功沟通，并能够从根本上管理好你的事务，那么灵魂更深层次的需求就会开始浮现，随之而来的是你的生命之谜。</p>
<p>Of course, people are afraid of the Mystery. They think it will deprive them of what they want. They think it will overtake them or destroy them. All kinds of fears and ridiculous notions are projected upon the growing reality of the Mystery.</p>
<p>当然，人们害怕神秘。他们认为它会剥夺他们想要的东西。他们认为它会超越他们或毁灭他们。各种各样的恐惧和荒谬的想法都投射到了神秘日益增长的现实之上。</p>
<p>The Mystery is relegated to religious figures or religious institutions or systems of belief. But the Mystery is still the Mystery. You know not where it comes from or what it will do. It is the part of you that is free—free of all of the constraints that hold you down, that keep you from recognizing and experiencing your deeper nature and your unique gifts to the world.</p>
<p>神秘被贬低为宗教人物、宗教机构或信仰体系。但神秘依然是神秘。你不知道它来自何方，或它将做什么。它是你自由的部分——摆脱了所有束缚你的限制，摆脱了所有阻碍你认知和体验你更深层次自然以及你赋予世界的独特礼物的限制。</p>
<p>Knowledge is not corrupted by the world, the deeper Mind. It is free of the constraints of the world. It is not afraid of destruction and death because it is immortal. Though the body will perish eventually and may even undergo terrible experiences, this deeper part of you is immortal and cannot be destroyed.</p>
<p>内识不会被世界所腐蚀，它是更深层次的心灵。它不受世界束缚。它不惧怕毁灭和死亡，因为它是不朽的。虽然身体最终会消亡，甚至可能经历可怕的经历，但你内心深处的这个部分却是不朽的，无法被摧毁。</p>
<p>You are afraid of loss, future loss. You are afraid of losing everything you have. You are afraid of losing your mind. You are afraid of losing your position in society. You are afraid of losing your financial stability and security. You are afraid of losing the love and respect of your friends and family. You are afraid of being an outcast. You are afraid of personal failure. You are afraid of war. You are afraid of deprivation. You are afraid of violence. You are afraid of attack. You are afraid to lose your loved ones. You are afraid of loss.</p>
<p>你害怕失去，害怕未来的失去。你害怕失去你拥有的一切。你害怕失去你的心灵。你害怕失去你的社会地位。你害怕失去经济稳定和安全。你害怕失去朋友和家人的爱与尊重。你害怕被排斥。你害怕个人的失败。你害怕战争。你害怕被剥夺。你害怕暴力。你害怕袭击。你害怕失去你所爱的人。你害怕失去。</p>
<p>But there is a part of you that cannot be lost. You cannot lose it. You cannot destroy it. You cannot even cause it great agony, and that is why it is so very different from the mind that you think with—your worldly mind; your mind that is a product of your culture, your family, and your worldly experiences.</p>
<p>但你的一部分是无法丢失的。你无法失去它。你无法摧毁它。你甚至无法给它带来巨大的痛苦，正因如此，它与你用来思考的心灵——你世俗的心灵；你的心灵，是你的文化、你的家庭和你的世俗经验的产物——如此不同。</p>
<p>What great confidence it will give you to know that you have such a deeper Intelligence within you and that it can and will guide you in all things. It will show you what is important and will distinguish that from everything else. It will guide you to know who to be with and how to be with them and how not to fall prey to all the seductions and traps of beauty, wealth and charm.</p>
<p>知道你内在拥有一个如此更深层次的智能，并且它能够并且将会在所有事情上指引你，这将赋予你何等强大的自信。它会告诉你什么是重要的，并将它与其他一切区分开来。它会指引你懂得与谁相处，如何与他们相处，以及如何避免落入美貌、财富和魅力的所有诱惑和陷阱。</p>
<p>The mind will never feel secure without Knowledge to guide it. Your worldly mind will never be at ease and at peace without your greater Mind to direct it. Your life will never come into real balance until your deeper nature is discovered and is allowed to arise in your experience.</p>
<p>如果没有内识的指引，心灵永远不会感到安全。如果没有你更伟大的心灵的指引，你的世俗心灵永远不会感到安逸和平静。除非你更深层次的自然被发现，并被允许在你的体验中升起，否则你的生命永远不会获得真正的平衡。</p>
<p>This is the Mystery. We call it the Mystery because it is unknown to your worldly mind, and your worldly mind cannot explain it, define it or understand it completely.</p>
<p>这就是神秘。我们称之为神秘，因为它不为你世俗的心灵所知，你世俗的心灵也无法解释它、定义它，也无法完全领会它。</p>
<p>This is the Mystery of where you have come from and where you will go beyond this life, the Mystery of who guides you and those mysterious forces that seem to abide with you in times of great need and confusion. It is the Mystery of why certain things happen inexplicably. This is the Mystery of having events occur that you did not plan, but which prove to be very important for you.</p>
<p>这是关于你从何而来、以及你此生之后将去往何方的神秘；这是关于谁在指引你、以及那些在你极度匮乏和困惑之时似乎与你同在的神秘力量的神秘；这是关于某些事情为何莫名其妙地发生的神秘；这是关于发生一些你未曾计划、却最终证明对你至关重要的事件的神秘。</p>
<p>The Mystery will not overtake your life completely. You cannot simply be a passive follower. You must be actively engaged in the world and use all of your worldly wisdom, to whatever extent it has been achieved. And only here will your deeper Mind guide you. If you are indolent and irresponsible, if you want to live in some kind of spiritual welfare, Knowledge will not arise, and you will be left with your own disillusionment to face.</p>
<p>神秘不会完全掌控你的生命。你不能只是做一个被动的追随者。你必须积极地融入世界，运用你所有的世俗智慧，无论它已经达到何种程度。只有在这里，你更深层次的心灵才能指引你。如果你懒惰不负责任，如果你只想生活在某种精神的福利中，内识就不会升起，你将不得不面对你自身的幻灭。</p>
<p>You are here to serve. Service is your ultimate expression of your greater nature and the reality and the presence of the Divine in the world. But this is service not simply for a reward, not simply service to gain social recognition or even Divine approval. It is not service based upon restitution. It is not service as a kind of payment for your former errors.</p>
<p>你来此是为了服务。服务是你对你更伟大自然以及神圣在世间的现实和存在的终极表达。但这种服务并非仅仅为了回报，并非仅仅为了获得社会认可甚至神圣认可。它并非基于补偿的服务。它并非作为对你过去错误的某种补偿的服务。</p>
<p>It is something that emerges naturally within you, from a deeper conscience within you. It is not a compensation. It is a natural expression of your deeper nature and an early indicator of your greater work in the world.</p>
<p>它是你内在自然浮现的内识，来自你内在更深层次的良知。它不是一种补偿。它是你更深层次自然的自然表达，也是你在世界上更伟大工作的早期指标。</p>
<p>People want the Mystery to give them everything they want, but the Mystery has other plans for them. People want the Mystery to create miracles for them, to give them financial security and to bring them love and companionship and the perfect employment and wonderful health and all of this as if God were your servant and errand boy, serving your wandering, changing desires.</p>
<p>人们希望神秘能给予他们一切所需，但神秘却另有安排。人们希望神秘能为他们创造奇迹，给予他们经济保障，带来爱与陪伴、完美的工作和极佳的健康，所有这一切，仿佛上帝是你的仆人和跑腿小弟，服务于你那飘忽不定、变幻莫测的欲望。</p>
<p>But the Mystery has greater plans for you, and they are not your plans. They are not the plans that you have based upon culture and upon personal insecurity and need. And it is this relinquishment on your part, the willingness to have your plans and understanding superseded by something greater, more mysterious and more profound that begins to open the doors of revelation for you.</p>
<p>但是，神秘对你有着更伟大的计划，它们并非你的计划。它们并非你基于文化、基于个人的不安全感和需求而拥有的计划。正是你这方面的放弃，正是你愿意让你的计划和理解被一种更伟大、更神秘、更深刻的内识取代，才开始为你打开启示之门。</p>
<p>Here you finally realize the truth that you are not your mind, you are not your body and that your deeper nature can function in a much more expansive and creative universe. Even though you are still limited by physical reality—by the constraints of your body and by the constraints of your situation to a great degree—the power and presence of the Mystery within you can often exceed these limitations and allow you to see, know and do things that other people do not see, do not know and cannot do.</p>
<p>在这里，你终于意识到这个真理：你并非你的心灵，你并非你的身体，你更深层次的自然能够在一个远为广阔和富有创造力的宇宙里运作。即使你依然受限于物质现实——受限于你身体的制约，以及在很大程度上受限于你境况的制约——你内在神秘的力量和存在往往能够超越这些制约，并允许你看见、知道和做到其他人看不见、不知道、无法做到的事情。</p>
<p>This is the evidence made manifest of a greater reality working through you—bringing clarity, balance and power to your life, providing service to others. Here there is no Master. There is no superhuman. There is no super man or super woman. There is only the person who is allowing the Mystery to guide them and to give them a greater direction and purpose.</p>
<p>这是更伟大的现实通过你运作的显化证据——它为你的生命带来明晰、平衡与力量，并为他人提供服务。这里没有大师。没有超人。没有超人或女超人。只有允许神秘指引他们，赋予他们更伟大方向和目的的人。</p>
<p>But your mind knows not of the Mystery. It can only recognize it and open itself to its power and presence. This is the practice that people undertake in the study of Steps to Knowledge, the spiritual pathway that has been given to humanity at this great turning point in human evolution, at this time of increasing upheaval, uncertainty and discord in the world.</p>
<p>但你的心灵并不知道神秘。它只能认知它，并向它的力量和存在打开它自身。这就是人们在学习内识进阶时所进行的修行。内识进阶是人类进化史上这一伟大转折点上，在这个世界动荡、不确定与不和谐日益加剧的时代，赋予人类的精神之路。</p>
<p>Steps to Knowledge brings your worldly mind into an alignment and into a deeper experience of the Mystery within you. This is a preparation not created by the intellect. It is not a product of one man’s creativity or invention. It is a gift of the Divine for a struggling humanity.</p>
<p>内识进阶将带你的世俗心灵进入一种校准，并进入对你内在神秘的更深层次的体验。这是一种并非由智力创造的准备。它并非源于一个人的创造力或发明。它是神圣赐予挣扎中的人类的礼物。</p>
<p>Here your worldly mind learns to think productively, creatively and in harmony with your deeper nature, allowing a transference of power and a deeper reality to emerge within you. It is a mysterious process because it is beyond the realm and reach of the intellect. That is why you can experience it fully, but never fully understand it. You cannot conceptualize it and say, “This is it!”</p>
<p>在这里，你的世俗心灵学习富有成效地、创造性地思考，并与你更深层次的自然和谐相处，从而允许一种力量的转移和一个更深层次的现实在你内在浮现。它是一个神秘的过程，因为它超越了智力的范畴和范围。正因如此，你能够充分体验它，却永远无法完全理解它。你无法概念化它并说：“就是它了！”</p>
<p>That is why mastery and achievement are more subtle and have more to do with the Mystery than with the magnificence of the intellect. The intellect is a wonderful instrument of communication. It is immensely creative. But it can only function in its fullness, in its greatest capacity, in service to the Mystery.</p>
<p>正因如此，精通和成就更加微妙，与其说与智力的辉煌有关，不如说与神秘息息相关。智力是绝佳的沟通工具。它拥有无比的创造力。但它只有在服务于神秘时，才能充分发挥其最大潜能。</p>
<p>The Mystery is God, you see. Here you can experience God without understanding God. You can receive the blessings of the Creator without understanding how or why you receive these. Here you are always humble, and humbled, in the face of the greater power that is working through you and through others to direct humanity to a Greater Reality in the future and to prepare humanity for the great difficulties and the great change that are coming to the world.</p>
<p>你看，神秘就是上帝。在这里，你能够体验上帝，却不理解上帝。你能够接收造物主的祝福，却不理解你如何或为何接收这些。在这里，你始终谦逊，谦逊地面对着更伟大力量，它正通过你和他人运作，指引人类走向未来的更伟大现实，并让人类为即将降临世界的巨大困难和巨变进行准备。</p>
<p>People try to understand all these things with the intellect, and to a certain extent they can see the reality of this great change. They can certainly feel it at a deeper level. But only Knowledge knows what is coming over the horizon. Only the Mystery knows how you can prepare for a future that will be so unlike the past.</p>
<p>人们试图用智力去理解所有这些事情，并且在一定程度上能够看到这个伟大变革的现实。他们当然能够在更深的层面感受到它。但只有内识知道地平线上即将发生什么。只有神秘知道如何为一个与过去截然不同的未来做好准备。</p>
<p>Only God can bring you to God. Only the Mystery knows the Mystery. Only the Mystery knows who you are and why you are in the world at this time and what you must do specifically and whom you must meet and where you must go to fulfill your greater destiny here.</p>
<p>唯有上帝能够带你走向上帝。唯有神秘知晓神秘。唯有神秘知晓你是谁，你为何此刻身处世界，你必须具体做什么，你必须遇见谁，你必须去往何处才能成就你在此的更伟大天命。</p>
<p>Here the Mystery transcends religious distinctions, systems of belief and institutions. Here the Mystery transcends your great spiritual heroes, even those who have been deified, even those around whom whole religions have been created. This takes you beyond the manifestations and the boundaries of culture and intellectual understanding—opening your eyes to see greater things, opening your ears to hear greater things, opening your heart and your mind to know greater things.</p>
<p>在这里，神秘超越宗教区分、信仰体系和机构。在这里，神秘超越你伟大的精神英雄，甚至那些被神化的英雄，甚至那些被创造出各种宗教的人。这带你超越显化以及文化和智力理解的界限——打开你的眼睛去看更伟大的事情，打开你的耳朵去聆听更伟大的事情，打开你的内心和心灵去知道更伟大的事情。</p>
<p>While it is so true that a person can dedicate themselves to a religious life, but never really experience the Mystery very deeply at all. They are religious in their intellectual understanding and in their self-definition, in their values and pursuits, but it does not mean they have really made the Divine connection yet. And when they do, if they do, it will take them beyond their self-definitions. It will take them beyond their system of belief. It will take them beyond the limits and the boundaries of the intellect.</p>
<p>诚然，一个人可以献身于宗教生活，却从未真正深刻地体验过神秘。他们在智力上理解、自我定义、价值观和追求上是虔诚的，但这并不意味着他们已经真正建立了与神圣的连接。而当他们真正建立了连接时，如果他们建立了连接，这将使他们超越自我定义。这将使他们超越信仰体系。这将使他们超越智力的局限和界限。</p>
<p>That is why so many people are afraid of the Mystery, you see. They are afraid of what lies beyond the limits and boundaries of their understanding. And yet within them, there is always a deference to a greater power of some sort. To whatever they may ascribe that greater power to, there is always the need to yield to a greater power. But without the Mystery, this becomes a form of self-subjugation and dangerous submission to political and economic forces. This is why people can follow and so fervently believe in individuals who are wholly destructive and corrupt.</p>
<p>你看，正因为如此，如此多的人害怕神秘。他们害怕超越他们理解的界限和疆界的事情。然而，在他们内心深处，却始终存在着对某种更伟大力量的顺从。无论他们将那更伟大力量归于何方，他们始终需要臣服于那更伟大力量。但如果没有那神秘，这就会变成一种自我征服，以及对政治和经济力量的危险屈服。正因为如此，人们才会追随并如此狂热地相信那些完全具有破坏性和腐败性的个体。</p>
<p>You can only give yourself to the Mystery. If your approach is true and authentic—without hidden motives, without clever manipulations, without secret desires—then your connection will be real and true. It will unite you with people. It will give you compassion and tolerance. And it will show you that violence and conflict can never be successful in resolving the fundamental needs and problems of humanity.</p>
<p>你只能把你自己交给神秘。如果你的途径真实而真诚——没有隐藏的动机，没有巧妙的操控，没有隐秘的欲望——那么你的连接将是真实而真诚的。它将把你与人们团结起来。它将赋予你同情心和宽容。它将向你展示，暴力和冲突永远无法成功解决人类的根本需求和问题。</p>
<p>Here you will need a real pathway to follow, whether it be a traditional pathway or part of the New Revelation from the Creator, which is now in the world today. You will need a competent guide and teacher, for you yourself cannot see your blind spots and are prone to make serious mistakes in your understanding and your recognition of the Mystery.</p>
<p>在这里，你需要一条真正的道路去追随，无论它是一条传统的道路，还是来自造物主的新启示的一部分，它如今就存在于当今世界。你需要一位称职的向导和导师，因为你自己无法看到你的盲点，并且容易在你对神秘的理解和认知上犯下严重的错误。</p>
<p>You will need strong companions who can bear witness to the power of Knowledge and who they themselves are undergoing a process of preparation to engage with the Mystery. You will need strong support. You will need honest correction from others. You will need a community of Knowledge to be a part of. You will need to practice on your own and learn how to direct your mind instead of being a slave to your mind.</p>
<p>你需要强大的同伴，他们能够见证内识的力量，并且他们自身正在经历一个准备过程，以参与神秘。你需要强有力的支持。你需要来自他人的诚实纠正。你需要一个内识社区来成为其中的一部分。你需要独自修行，学习如何引导你的心灵，而不是成为你心灵的奴隶。</p>
<p>You will have to alter your course in life. This brings about a natural reshuffling of your priorities and values into something that is much more in alignment with your deeper feelings and experience. You will need a true teacher, and they are very hard to find in the world, but the Powers that serve your emergence will bring you to them.</p>
<p>你必须改变你的生命轨迹。这自然会将你的优先事项和价值观重新调整，使其更符合你更深层次的感受和体验。你需要一位真正的老师，而这样的老师在世上很难找到，但那些助你成长的力量会引领你走向他们。</p>
<p>This is part of the Mystery, you see. For while you have a worldly family, you have a Spiritual Family as well—those within the world and beyond who are here to engage you in your greater purpose for being here and who are themselves deeply connected to the Mystery.</p>
<p>你看，这是神秘的一部分。因为虽然你拥有一个世俗家庭，但你也拥有一个精神家庭——那些在世界之内和之外的存在，他们在此参与你身处此地的更伟大目的，他们自身也深深地联接着神秘。</p>
<p>Here you can be a Buddhist, or a Christian, or a Muslim or a Jew and be guided by the Mystery. You are not guided by rules and dictates, laws and customs here, except those which you must accommodate to function in society. Your heart is given to a Greater Power and to a greater manifestation.</p>
<p>在这里，你可以是佛教徒、基督徒、穆斯林或犹太教徒，并被神秘所指引。你不受规则、指令、法律和习俗的指引，除非你必须适应那些才能在社会中生存的事物。你的心被赋予了一种更伟大的力量，一种更伟大的显化。</p>
<p>Here there will be no conflict between the Christians and the Muslims, the Buddhists or the Jews or between any group because you are all connected to the Mystery. And in the Mystery, there is no conflict. There are only different avenues of expression. There are only different systems of thought to work through, different cultures to work through—all to bring a greater unity, a greater harmony and a greater power to humanity.</p>
<p>在这里，基督徒和穆斯林之间、佛教徒和犹太教徒之间，或者任何群体之间都不会发生冲突，因为你们都与神秘相连。而在神秘之中，没有冲突。只有不同的表达途径。只有不同的思想体系需要努力，不同的文化需要努力——所有这些都是为了给人类带来一种更伟大的团结、更伟大的和谐和更伟大的力量。</p>
<p>At this moment, you can think of many things you need, and even more things perhaps that you want or think that you want. But if you have enough food to eat and a roof over your head and clothing to protect you against the winds of the world, then your greatest need now is for the Mystery.</p>
<p>此时此刻，你能想到很多你需要的东西，甚至更多你想要的，或者自认为想要的东西。但如果你有足够的食物，有栖身之所，有遮风挡雨的衣服，那么你现在最需要的就是神秘。</p>
<p>This is a power that will save and redeem you, bring to you fulfillment and true relationship, and will guide and direct your life in ways that you could never discern from your intellect or from your worldly mind. This is a power that will utilize all of your wisdom and physical and mental abilities, and elevate them as well, as your life moves into an arena of greater contribution, greater relationship and greater recognition.</p>
<p>这股力量将拯救和救赎你，带给你成就感和真正的关系，并将以你从你的智力或世俗心灵中无法辨识的方式指引和指导你的生命。这股力量将善用你所有的智慧以及身心能力，并提升它们，因为你的生命将迈向一个更伟大贡献、更伟大关系和更伟大认知的舞台。</p>
<p>Here you will have to have faith that the Mystery is there during all the times when you are not experiencing it, for the Mystery does not manifest every day. The Mystery does not speak to you every day. The Mystery does not care what clothes you put on your body or what you choose to eat for dinner. It is concerned with greater matters.</p>
<p>在这里，你必须有信仰，即使你没有体验到神秘，它依然存在，因为神秘并非每天都在显现。神秘并非每天都在对你说话。神秘不在乎你穿什么衣服，也不在乎你晚餐选择吃什么。它关心的是更伟大的事情。</p>
<p>You have a mind and intellect to deal with the particulars of your life, with the daily management of your affairs, with the organization of your time and activities. That is in the [province] of your intellect. The Mystery will guide you when there are real conflicts, real confusion and difficult decisions to make to keep you on track with your greater destiny, which awaits you down the road.</p>
<p>你拥有心灵和智力，能够处理你生命中的细节，管理你的日常事务，组织你的时间和活动。这属于你的智力范畴。当你面临真正的冲突、真正的困惑和艰难抉择时，神秘会指引你，让你走在通往未来等待你的更伟大天命的道路上。</p>
<p>If you understand you are working with the Mystery and do not try to define it or give it a definition or a purpose according to your understanding, you will be able to allow part of your mind to always be open to its counsel, its guidance and its wisdom.</p>
<p>如果你理解你正在与神秘共事，并且不试图根据你的理解去定义它或给它一个定义或目的，你将能够让你的一部分心灵始终对它的忠告、它的指导和它的智慧保持开放。</p>
<p>You have an open mind, not to everything in the world, but to the power and presence of this guidance, which over time you will come to recognize and distinguish from all other forces, all other delusions, all other fantasies that may exist beyond the visual range, beyond the manifestation of the world.</p>
<p>你有一颗开放的心灵，不是对世界上的一切，而是对这种指导的力量和存在，​​随着时间的推移，你会认识到并区分所有其他力量、所有其他妄想、所有其他可能存在于视觉范围之外、世界表现之外的幻想。</p>
<p>Consider these things. Utilize the directives that We have given you here today. Put them in front of you and keep them in front of you. Allow your understanding to grow and to expand. Do not contract it or limit it by trying to have conclusions about something which you really cannot yet understand.</p>
<p>思考这些事。运用我们今天在此给予你的指示。把它们摆在你面前，并牢牢地记在眼前。让你的理解不断增长和拓展。不要试图对你尚无法真正理解的事物下结论，从而收缩或限制它。</p>
<p>Allow the Mystery to be the Mystery. But understand you have a deeper Mind that is beyond the influences of the world, that cannot be corrupted, that cannot be manipulated, that cannot be seduced or induced. For it is connected to God. It responds to the Will of God and to those Spiritual Forces who are here to assist you in your life and to oversee humanity’s development and successful emergence into a universe full of intelligent life—matters which are far beyond your personal concerns and your personal understanding.</p>
<p>让神秘成为神秘。但要理解，你拥有一个超越世界影响的更深层次的心灵，它无法被腐蚀，无法被操控，无法被诱惑或诱导。因为它与上帝相连。它回应上帝的意志，回应那些在此协助你生命、守护人类发展并成功迈向一个充满智能生命的宇宙的精神势力——这些事远远超越你个人的关切和你个人的理解。</p>
<p>Treat the manifestation practically, wisely, using the wisdom and the skills you have developed, and be open to developing more skill and wisdom here, for you will greatly need it. But do not confuse the Mystery with the manifestation.</p>
<p>务实地、明智地对待这个显化，运用你已发展出的智慧和技能，并敞开心扉，在此发展更多技能和智慧，因为你将非常需要它。但不要将神秘与显化混淆。</p>
<p>The manifestation you must understand and can understand to a very great degree, but the Mystery is the Mystery. It exceeds your capacity. It is bigger than you are. It is bigger than the world. Do not try to define it according to religious terms or limit it to a religious ideology, but allow it to be the Mystery. Then it can flow freely through you and to you, and you will not close the door to it or obstruct it by attempting to guide it or to understand it.</p>
<p>你必须理解这个显化，并且能够在很大程度上理解它，但神秘就是神秘。它超越你的能力。它比你自身更广阔。它比世界更广阔。别试图用宗教术语来定义它，或将它限制在某种宗教意识形态中，而是让它成为神秘。这样它就能自由地流经你，流向你，你就不会因为试图引导它或理解它而关闭它的大门或阻碍它。</p>
<p>It is a conduit of power. It is the golden thread of your life. It is your connection to the Divine. It exists above and beyond the realm of your intellect. It speaks of a deeper nature that existed before you came into the world and that you will experience once you leave this world. It has everything to do with who you are and why you are here, whom you must meet, what you must do, what you yourself must avoid, what you yourself must discern. It will reveal to you the hazards of life that you cannot yet see and how to navigate an increasingly uncertain and discordant world.</p>
<p>它是力量的管道。它是你生命的金线。它是你与神圣的联接。它存在于你的智力领域之上和之外。它讲述着一个在你来到世界之前就已存在的更深层次的自然，并且一旦你离开这个世界，你将会体验到它。它与你是谁以及你为何在此，你必须遇见谁，你必须做什么，你自己必须避免什么，你自己必须辨识什么息息相关。它将向你揭示你尚无法看见的生命危险，以及如何在一个日益不确定和不和谐的世界中航行。</p>
<p>What greater gift could God give to you? If you think that God could simply satisfy all your wandering desires, you would become ever more enslaved in the world, ever more burdened with the world, ever more trapped, ever more encumbered by your beliefs and possessions. Freedom would be unknown to you, and you would live in constant anxiety over the loss of these things.</p>
<p>上帝还能给你什么更大的礼物呢？如果你认为上帝能轻易满足你所有飘忽不定的欲望，你就会越来越被这个世界所奴役，越来越被这个世界所负担，越来越被你的信仰和财产所束缚。你将永远无法体会自由，你将永远生活在失去这些事物的焦虑之中。</p>
<p>God is here to liberate you, not to impoverish you. God is here to free you, not to encumber you or trap you. This you must discover for yourself, for Our words alone will not be enough to allay your fears and your anxieties.</p>
<p>上帝在此是为了解放你，而非使你贫困。上帝在此是为了解放你，而非束缚你或陷害你。这一点你必须自己去发现，因为单凭我们的话语不足以平息你的恐惧和焦虑。</p>
<p>God’s New Revelation will reveal the Mystery ever so clearly and speak to the Mystery and of the Mystery. You must learn to think of the Mystery, and to hold reverence for the Mystery, and be open to the Mystery—allowing your understanding to be incomplete, allowing your mind to be without conclusions, bearing witness to a Greater Power that over time will emerge in your life and which you will be able to see emerging in the lives of certain people who are undergoing the greater preparation in their lives.</p>
<p>上帝的新启示将非常清晰地揭示神秘，并谈论神秘和关于神秘。你必须学习思考神秘，敬畏神秘，并对神秘保持开放——允许你的理解不完整，允许你的心灵不带结论，见证一个更伟大的力量，随着时间的推移，它将在你的生命中呈现，你将能够看到它在某些正在经历更伟大准备的人们的生命中呈现。</p>
