<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on January 26, 2009 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2009 年 1 月 26 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humanity now must concern itself with avoiding disaster. This disaster is under recognized and under appreciated by the people who should be looking at this: people in government, people in commerce, religious leaders, community leaders and so forth.</p>
<p>人类现在必须关注如何避免灾难。这场灾难尚未被那些应该关注此事的人们所充分认识和重视：政府官员、商界人士、宗教领袖、社区领袖等等。</p>
<p>The disaster has to do with the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world—great environmental change, changing climate, violent weather, the loss of fundamental resources, the impact upon people and your ability to grow food, scarcity of water, growing economic hardship and instability, and the risk of nations going to war over who will have access to the remaining resources of the world.</p>
<p>灾难与正在降临世界的变革巨浪相关——巨大的环境变化，不断变化的气候，恶劣的天气，基础资源的丧失，对民众和你们种植粮食的能力的影响，水资源的匮乏，不断加剧的经济困境和不稳定，以及各国为争夺世界剩余资源而陷入战争的风险。</p>
<p>This is not merely a possibility or a distant event. It is very close at hand. Great Waves of change, all converging at the same time, each one of which has the power to destabilize human civilization, but collectively together they create a situation unlike anything that the human family has ever had to face before. And they will impact each other, creating cross currents and unforeseen events.</p>
<p>这不仅仅是一种可能性或一个遥远的事件。它近在咫尺。变革的巨浪，同时汇聚，每一个都拥有动摇人类文明的力量，但它们合在一起，创造了一种人类大家庭过去从未面临过的局面。它们将相互影响，制造逆流和不可预见的事件。</p>
<p>This makes it very unpredictable how this situation will unfold. But it cannot be denied that humanity is heading towards a disaster, a disaster that will have a greater impact upon the world over time than any war that has ever occurred here.</p>
<p>这使得局势如何发展变得非常难以预测。但不可否认的是，人类正走向一场灾难，这场灾难对世界的影响将远大于历史上任何一场战争。</p>
<p>Yet humanity is displaying all of the usual tendencies of denial and avoidance, blind optimism, faith in technology, a kind of weak response to a serious problem. While there are individuals who are becoming aware of the Great Waves of change and their immense potential for changing the landscape of the world, many people in positions of leadership and the public at large remain largely unaware.</p>
<p>然而，人类正在展现所有常见的否认和回避倾向，盲目乐观，对科技的迷信，以及对一个严重问题的某种软弱反应。尽管有些人开始意识到变革的巨浪及其改变世界格局的巨大潜力，但许多处于领导地位的人和广大公众仍然在很大程度上没有意识到。</p>
<p>Economic hardship is upon you now, but that really is only the beginning. That is a human creation that can be rectified over time. But the Great Waves of change involve a changing world, a different environment, a diminishing set of resources, something that humanity cannot easily rectify upon its own.</p>
<p>经济困境如今降临你们，但这真的只是一个开始。这是人类的创造，可以随着时间推移得到纠正。但变革的巨浪涉及一个变化的世界，一个不同的环境，一套日益缩减的资源，这是人类无法轻易独自纠正的。</p>
<p>For your natural inheritance has been spent unwisely, foolishly and greedily. The exploitation of the world has accelerated so quickly with such devastating effects that the human family will have to face a declining world in the future.</p>
<p>因为你们的自然遗产已被不明智、愚蠢和贪婪地浪费。对世界的剥削加速如此之快，其后果如此灾难性，以至于人类大家庭未来将不得不面对一个衰落的世界。</p>
<p>In essence, your children’s future is being spent. Your children’s resources are being spent. And while you have clever gadgets to entertain yourself with, who has the eyes to see and the ears to hear what has really occurred in the world at large?</p>
<p>本质上，你们孩子的未来正在被消耗。你们孩子的资源正在被消耗。虽然你们有各种精巧的玩意儿自娱自乐，但谁有眼睛去看，谁有耳朵去听，这个世界究竟发生了什么？</p>
<p>It is not simply that humanity has problems. It has always had problems, but this is of a far greater magnitude. How will humanity cope with a growing population and a shrinking well of resources? What would prevent humanity from destroying itself in constant conflict over who has access to these resources? What can lift humanity above its self-destructive tendencies, its foolishness and its lack of response to what is coming over the horizon?</p>
<p>人类的问题远不止于此。人类一直都面临问题，但这一次的规模要大得多。人类将如何应对日益增长的人口和日益萎缩的资源？什么能阻止人类在争夺资源的持续冲突中自我毁灭？什么能帮助人类超越自我毁灭的倾向、愚蠢以及对即将发生的事情的无动于衷？</p>
<p>Clearly, it must be a power that is greater than the intellect. For while the intellect is clever and inventive, it is rarely wise and prudent. It is a power that must be managed by a Greater Power to be truly effective and beneficial.</p>
<p>显然，它必须是一种超越智力的力量。因为智力虽然聪明且富有创造力，却很少明智且审慎。这种力量必须由一种更伟大的力量来掌控，才能真正有效且有益。</p>
<p>This Greater Power is the Power of Knowledge within the individual, a Greater Power that the Creator of all life has placed within each person to guide them, to protect them and to lead them to a greater life and contribution in the world. But so few people are aware of this great endowment, God’s great gift to humanity, that it is as if it does not exist or only seems to be a dream or a remote possibility for people.</p>
<p>这更伟大的力量是个体内在的内识力量，是所有生命的创造者置于每个人内在的更伟大的力量，用来指引他们、保护他们，并引领他们走向更伟大的生命，为世界做出贡献。然而，很少有人察觉到这伟大的礼物，这是上帝赐予人类的伟大礼物，以至于它仿佛并不存在，或者对人们来说只是一个梦想或一个遥不可及的可能性。</p>
<p>Look at the world around you. Look at the particular things in your environment and ask yourself: “Can this be sustained into the future?” Look at your automobiles, and the structure of your cities, and the transportation of your food, and the manufacture of your goods, and ask yourself in each case: “Can this be sustained into the future?” Look at your ever growing cities, ever expanding cities, and ask yourself: “Can this be sustained into the future?” Look at your shrinking forests and your polluted rivers and the loss of topsoil in your agricultural areas and ask yourself: “Can this be sustained into the future?” And look at your ever more unpredictable weather and violent weather events, and ask yourself: “Can this be dealt with in the future?”</p>
<p>看看你周围的世界。看看你周围环境中的具体事物，问问你自己：“这种情况在未来还能持续下去吗？”看看你们的汽车、你们的城市结构、你们的食品运输、你们的商品制造，并在每一种情况下都问问你自己：“这种情况在未来还能持续下去吗？”看看你不断增长的城市，不断扩张的城市，问问你自己：“这种情况在未来还能持续下去吗？”看看你们不断萎缩的森林、受污染的河流以及农业区表土的流失，问问你自己：“这种情况在未来还能持续下去吗？”看看你们越来越难以预测的天气和剧烈的天气事件，问问你自己：“这种情况在未来还能应对吗？”</p>
<p>It is a fundamental decision here that faces actually every person. It is the decision over what they will listen to within themselves. You have the power and the presence of Knowledge, a deeper conscience within you, which has the Wisdom of the Creator. But you also have all of the potential capabilities and incentives to carry out every form of destructiveness, ignorance and violence upon yourselves and one another.</p>
<p>它是每个人实际上都面临的一个根本性抉择。它是关于他们将聆听他们自己内在什么的抉择。你拥有内识的力量和存在，你内在的一种更深层次的良知，它拥有造物主的智慧。但你也拥有所有潜在的能力和动机，去对你自身以及彼此施行各种形式的破坏、无知和暴力。</p>
<p>What will you listen to? Which will you follow? You will follow one or the other. Because they are mutually exclusive, it is difficult to follow both to any great degree. So eventually you will have to choose one over the other increasingly.</p>
<p>你会听什么？你会追随哪一种？你要么追随其中一种。由于它们互相排斥，很难同时追随两者。所以最终你将不得不越来越倾向于选择其中一种。</p>
<p>It is not just having good government programs or charismatic leaders. This is the decision that everyone will have to make, and how they will decide will determine the outcome. It will determine whether disaster can be avoided or whether disaster will be encouraged.</p>
<p>它不仅仅是拥有良好的政府计划或富有魅力的领导人。这是每个人都必须做出的决定，而他们的决定将决定最终结果。它将决定灾难是可以避免的，还是会助长灾难。</p>
<p>Most people will not encourage disaster consciously or willingly, but clearly if humanity does not begin to recognize its predicament, it will cast itself into a very grave set of circumstances, which will produce immense hardship, deprivation and loss of life in the world. You do not have to be a genius to see this. You just have to ask the right questions and have the courage to look out over the horizon of your life with as much objectivity as you can—without fear or preference, without insisting upon what you want or denying what could take place.</p>
<p>大多数人不会有意或无意地鼓励灾难，但显然，如果人类不开始认识到其困境，人类将使它自己陷入一系列非常严峻的境况，这将给世界带来巨大的苦难、匮乏和生命损失。你无需是一位天才就能看到这一点。你只需要提出正确的问题，并有勇气以尽可能客观的态度审视你的生命视野——不带恐惧或偏好，不坚持你想要的，也不否认可能发生的事情。</p>
<p>Here you must recognize that what you are facing is unlike the past. You may say humanity has survived and worked through all of its great problems and tribulations, but that does not mean you will be able to do this into the future. The possibility is there. The need is there. The necessity is there.</p>
<p>在此你必须认识到，你所面对的与过去不同。你或许会说人类已经生存下来并克服了它所有的重大问题和磨难，但这并不意味着你能够在未来做到这一点。可能性就在那里。需求就在那里。必要性就在那里。</p>
<p>But it will have to do with what nations and their populations, individuals, and you yourself will have to choose—what you will choose, what you will be willing to give up, how much you can adapt to changing circumstances, and what kind of restraint you can put upon yourself so you do not become vehement and revengeful and hateful of others.</p>
<p>但它必须与哪些国家及其民众、个体以及你自己必须做出的选择有关——你将选择什么，你将愿意放弃什么，你能在多大程度上适应变化的境况，以及你能对你自己施加什么样的克制，这样你就不会变得激烈、报复和仇恨他人。</p>
<p>Most people do not want to lose wealth and power, whatever wealth and power they might already possess. And of course there are so many people who have no wealth or power, no social power, no ability to redirect their lives.</p>
<p>大多数人都不想失去财富和权力，无论他们已经拥有多少财富和权力。当然，还有很多人既没有财富，也没有权力，没有社会影响力，也没有能力重新规划他们的人生。</p>
<p>Here you cannot rely upon ideas, beliefs or systems of government alone. There must be a fundamental change of heart, a commitment to move in the right direction even if you do not have answers and solutions.</p>
<p>在这里，你不能仅仅依赖想法、信仰或政府体制。你必须从根本上改变内心，即使没有答案和解决方案，也要致力于朝着正确的方向前进。</p>
<p>People who insist upon answers and solutions have not really faced the situation for themselves. They have not really recognized that they too must take a journey—a journey of preparation, a journey that will require a re-evaluation of their lives, a journey that will alter the course of their lives and will change the circumstances of their lives.</p>
<p>那些坚持寻求答案和解决方案的人们并没有真正亲自面对境况。他们并没有真正认识到他们也必须踏上一段旅程——一段准备的旅程，一段将要求他们重新评估生命的旅程，一段将改变他们生命历程并改变他们生命境遇的旅程。</p>
<p>The people who insist that someone must have solutions or answers have not really taken responsibility for what they themselves must do and must face and must reconsider. Do not think that God will save humanity at the last minute. People have wild associations with this and wild expectations. They think it is the end times, and so the righteous will be spared, and everyone else will be cast into the inferno.</p>
<p>那些坚持认为必须有人提供解决方案或答案的人，并没有真正承担起他们自己必须做的事情、必须面对的事情和必须重新思考的事情的责任。不要认为上帝会在最后一刻拯救人类。人们对此有着不切实际的联想和不切实际的期望。他们认为这是末日，义人将幸免于难，而其他人将被投入地狱。</p>
<p>Here again there is no responsibility. There is no real recognition that humanity is facing the product of its own misuse of the world, and this has nothing to do with God or destiny or the end of times.</p>
<p>这里再次出现了责任缺失。人们没有真正认识到，人类正面临着它自身滥用世界的后果，这与上帝、天命或世界末日无关。</p>
<p>It will be the end of certain kinds of beliefs, values and perhaps lifestyles. It will be the end of an era. But the world will go on. Life will go on. This world is like a grain of sand in the universe. Everything will go on.</p>
<p>它将是某些信仰、价值观，甚至生活方式的终结。它将是一个时代的终结。但世界仍将继续。生命仍将继续。这个世界就像宇宙中的一粒沙。一切都将继续。</p>
<p>But whether human civilization can survive the product of its own self-destructive and unwise behavior is another question. It is a question that can only be answered in the minds and hearts of people.</p>
<p>但人类文明能否在其自我毁灭和不明智行为的产物中幸存下来则是另一个问题。这个问题只能在人们的心灵与内心中得到解答。</p>
<p>There will be no punishment from God. There will be no Judgment Day. Why would God judge you when God knows that without Knowledge, you could only make mistakes and would ceaselessly invest yourself against your own welfare and your own future.</p>
<p>上帝不会有惩罚。不会有审判日。上帝知道，若无内识，你只会犯错，只会不断地投入你自己，损害你自身的福祉和未来，那为何还要审判你呢？</p>
<p>The Creator of all life has given you Knowledge to guide you. Should you neglect it, deny it or avoid it, then your life will be reckless and hazardous, full of errors and regrets, full of frustration and self-recrimination. But the answer is still within you and within others. God has not given up on you though you have given up on God.</p>
<p>所有生命的创造者赋予了你内识来指引你。如果你忽视它、否认它或逃避它，那么你的生命将会变得鲁莽和危险，充满错误和遗憾，充满挫折和自责。但答案依然在你心中，也在他人心中。尽管你放弃了上帝，但上帝并没有放弃你。</p>
<p>Instead of praying for a miracle, you must pray for strength and courage for yourself and for others. Instead of praying for God to intervene on your behalf, you must pray for the strength to find and to follow the Knowledge that God has placed within you. God has already given you everything you need, but you do not know what God has given you. People remain blind and ignorant of the Power and the Presence that has been placed within them.</p>
<p>你不应该祈求奇迹，而应该祈求为你自己和他人的力量和勇气。你不应该祈求上帝为你介入，而应该祈求力量去发现并遵循上帝放置在你内在的内识。上帝已然赋予你所需的一切，但你却不知道上帝赋予了你什么。人们对被置于他们内在的力量和存在依然盲目和无知。</p>
<p>Until you recognize your circumstances and the situation at hand, you will not realize your profound need for guidance and counsel. You will still think it is a problem for other people to solve, for governments to solve, for other nations to solve. You will still be passive and irresponsible, thinking it is not really your problem and that you really cannot do anything anyway.</p>
<p>除非你认清你的处境和眼前的处境，否则你不会意识到你对指引和忠告的深刻需求。你仍然会认为这是一个需要其他人去解决、需要政府去解决、需要其他国家去解决的问题。你仍然会消极且不负责任，认为这实际上并非你的问题，而且你无论如何也无能为力。</p>
<p>It is these prevailing attitudes that keep humanity from responding to the signs of the world and to the signs from Knowledge within people—warning them, restraining them, guiding them. But if you cannot be restrained, if you cannot be warned, if you cannot be alerted, if you will not look and see, if you will not live with the problem for which you do not have answers, then the great gift and the endowment will be lost upon you.</p>
<p>正是这些普遍存在的态度，阻止人类回应世界的征兆，以及来自人们内在内识的征兆——警告他们，约束他们，引导他们。但是如果你无法被约束，如果你无法被警告，如果你无法被警醒，如果你不愿观察和看见，如果你不愿带着你没有答案的问题生活，那么你就会失去这伟大的礼物和禀赋。</p>
<p>Here you must not live in either hope or hopelessness, but instead adopt a position of courage, strength and determination. It is courage to face a set of circumstances for which you do not have answers or solutions. It is the courage to realize you must change your life and your circumstances accordingly so that your position can be more stable and secure, and so that you can be in a position to be of assistance to others.</p>
<p>在这里，你既不能生活在希望之中，也不能生活在绝望之中，而是要采取一种勇气、力量和决心的姿态。勇气在于直面一系列你没有答案或解决方案的境况。勇气在于认识到你必须相应地改变你的生命和你的境况，这样你的处境才能更加稳定和稳固，这样你才能处于能够帮助他人的位置。</p>
<p>This requires strength because you must overcome your own habits and tendencies that weaken you, that dissuade you, that tell you that you are hopeless or impotent in the face of great change. And you must be determined. You cannot give up. Even if everyone around you seems to be hopeless and helpless, you cannot give up.</p>
<p>这需要力量，因为你必须克服你自身的习惯和倾向，它们会削弱你，阻碍你，告诉你在伟大的变革面前你毫无希望或无能为力。你必须下定决心，不能放弃。即使你周围的每个人都显得绝望无助，你也不能放弃。</p>
<p>So many people will succumb to fear, will succumb to hopelessness, will succumb to panic. So many people will blame others. Their hatred will turn upon others and even upon their own leaders. It is those who will not follow this that hold the real promise for humanity and for its future and its ability to establish a new beginning.</p>
<p>如此多的人将屈服于恐惧，屈服于绝望，屈服于恐慌。如此多的人将责怪他人。他们的仇恨将转向他人，甚至转向他们自己的领导人。正是那些不愿遵循这一点的人，为人类、为它的未来以及为它建立新开端的能力，带来了真正的希望。</p>
<p>Do not say to yourself, “Well, if we don’t do something, the world will change.” For the world has already changed. It is too late to go back. There is no going back. You can only go forward. You can only face the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>不要对你自己说：“好吧，如果我们不采取行动，世界就会改变。”因为世界已经改变了。回头已经太晚了。没有回头路了。你只能向前走。你只能面对变革的巨浪。</p>
<p>The signs of the world will tell you what is coming. You can mitigate it to a certain point, but by and large you will have to adapt to a changing set of circumstances. Your work, your relationships, your health, your activities, your associations will all have to be reconsidered in the face of the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>世界的迹象会告诉你即将发生什么。你可以在一定程度上缓解它，但总的来说，你必须适应不断变化的环境。面对巨浪般的变革，你的工作、你的人际关系、你的健康、你的活动、你的交往，所有这些都必须重新审视。</p>
<p>Where will you find the courage? Where will you find the strength? Where will you find the determination to do all these things?</p>
<p>你要去哪里找勇气？你要去哪里找力量？你要去哪里找决心去做所有这些事？</p>
<p>Your ideas will fail you. Your false optimism will evaporate. Your denial will prove to be self-destructive. Your hope and belief that others will take care of these problems for you will fall into grave doubt and anguish. Your friends, even your family, may abandon you and your decision to face the Great Waves of change and to prepare for them before the great difficulties arrive.</p>
<p>你的想法会落空。你虚假的乐观会烟消云散。你的否定最终会自我毁灭。你希望并相信别人会替你解决这些问题，如今却陷入深深的怀疑和痛苦之中。你的朋友，甚至你的家人，都可能抛弃你，抛弃你直面变革巨浪、在巨大困难到来之前做好准备的决定。</p>
<p>Where will you find the courage, the strength and the determination? It must come from Knowledge, for Knowledge is not afraid of the world. Knowledge is here to serve the world. Knowledge does not care about beauty, wealth and power. It is not attracted to all of the seductions that weaken people and lead them to betray themselves.</p>
<p>你将在哪里找到勇气、力量和决心？它必须来自内识，因为内识不惧怕世界。内识在此服务于世界。内识不在乎美貌、财富和权力。它不受所有那些削弱人们、导致他们背叛自我的诱惑的吸引。</p>
<p>Here your choices are limited, but they are very fundamental and consequential. There is nowhere to run and hide in the face of the Great Waves of change. There is no place where you can find safety and immunity from the impact of events that will reshape the whole world. There is no avoiding your responsibilities here without putting yourself into a grave and perilous situation.</p>
<p>在这里，你的选择是有限的，但它们却至关重要且意义重大。面对变革的巨浪，你无处可逃，无处可躲。你没有任何地方能够找到安全，免受那些将重塑整个世界的事件的影响。你无法逃避你在此的责任，否则你将陷入一个严峻而危险的境地。</p>
<p>Beware of what you tell yourself in this regard. It is not a question between hope and hopelessness. It is really a question between being responsible or irresponsible, being wise or unwise. It is fundamental.</p>
<p>在这方面，要谨慎对待你自己。它不是一个希望与绝望之间的问题。它实际上是一个负责任与不负责任、明智与不明智的问题。它是根本问题。</p>
<p>If you can face the great threshold, then you can begin to gather your strength, to re-evaluate your life, to reconsider your circumstances and your involvements—where you live, how you live, how you travel about, your work, your relationships, everything.</p>
<p>如果你能够面对这个伟大门槛，那么你就能开始凝聚你的力量，重新评估你的生命，重新思考你的境遇和你的参与——你住在哪里，你如何生活，你如何旅行，你的工作，你的关系，一切。</p>
<p>For in the face of the Great Waves of change, you will have the criteria to choose strength over weakness, wisdom over foolishness. The Great Waves will give you a greater purpose. They will require a greater strength from you and a greater responsibility.</p>
<p>因为面对变革的巨浪，你将拥有选择力量而非软弱、智慧而非愚蠢的标准。巨浪将赋予你更伟大的目的。它们将要求你拥有更伟大的力量，承担更伟大的责任。</p>
<p>God is sending a warning around the world—warning of the Great Waves of change that are coming and warning humanity of Intervention from races from the universe who are here working in secret to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity. While people go about their lives unaware and unconcerned, these two great events are underway, and each of them has the power to change the future and the fate of humanity and the lives of every person in the world.</p>
<p>上帝正在向全世界发送一个警告——警告正在来临的变革巨浪，并警告人类来自宇宙种族的干预，他们正在这里秘密行动，以利用软弱和分裂的人类。当人们浑然不觉、漠不关心地过着他们的生活时，这两件伟大的事件正在进行，它们每一个都拥有改变人类未来和命运以及世界上每个人生命的力量。</p>
<p>While there are many problems facing humanity at a local, regional, national and worldwide level, these two great events will overshadow everything. But how few people are responding, how few people are aware. It is not the conversation of governments and leaders particularly.</p>
<p>尽管人类在地方、区域、国家乃至全球层面都面临着诸多问题，但这两件大事将掩盖一切。然而，回应的人如此之少，察觉到的人如此之少。这尤其不是政府和领导人的讨论话题。</p>
<p>People want to believe that they will have more in the future and will be able to keep what they have today. They want reassurance, they want to believe, they want to hope. This is what their leaders provide for them for the most part. There is no real service here. There is no real contribution here.</p>
<p>人们希望相信未来会拥有更多，并且能够保住现在拥有的一切。他们想要安心，想要相信，想要希望。而这，大多都是他们的领导人为他们提供的。这里没有真正的服务，也没有真正的贡献。</p>
<p>People will not be prepared. They will not be warned. They will not realize their vulnerability and the nature of change that is emerging on the horizon.</p>
<p>人们不会做好准备。他们不会得到警告。他们不会意识到他们的脆弱性以及即将出现的变化的自然。</p>
<p>You need time to prepare for the Great Waves of change. It will take many steps and much courage and much support to do this. If you wait until the end, it will be too late. Then your options will be few, and there will be not much you can do.</p>
<p>你需要时间来为变革的巨浪做准备。它需要许多步骤、巨大的勇气和大量的支持。如果等到最后，就太晚了。到那时，你的选择将会很少，你能做的事情也会很少。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you knows what you must do, where you must go, what you must reconsider, what you must change. Your intellect cannot fathom this. It is too complex. So you must appeal to a greater power within yourself and within others. And it is this greater power that can enable you to navigate the uncertain times to come. It is this greater power that will unite you with others who can strengthen you and strengthen the world.</p>
<p>你内在的内识知道你必须做什么，你必须去往何方，你必须重新思考什么，你必须改变什么。你的智力无法理解这些。它太复杂了。所以你必须诉诸你内在以及他人内在的一种更伟大力量。正是这种更伟大的力量能够让你驾驭未来的不确定时期。正是这更伟大力量将把你与那些能够强化你并强化世界的人们团结起来。</p>
<p>It is a great set of trials humanity is now facing. But most of the nations in the universe have had to face this as well, for they too have overreached their world’s ability to sustain them and have either collapsed and fallen under domination by other powers, or have re-established their societies to deal with changing circumstances and the requirements of a limited world.</p>
<p>它是人类如今面临的一系列伟大考验。但宇宙中大多数国家也不得不面对这一点，因为它们也超越了其世界维持它们的能力，要么崩溃并落入其他国家的统治，要么重建它们的社会，以应对变化的境况和一个有限世界的要求。</p>
<p>You cannot avoid disaster, but you can prevent disaster. You cannot run away from disaster. You must face it.</p>
<p>你无法避免灾难，但你可以预防灾难。你无法逃避灾难。你必须面对它。</p>
<p>In a way, you are on your own here. For the governments will be overwhelmed. Your social services will be overwhelmed. Your economies will be overwhelmed. There must be a greater self-reliance and reliance upon other individuals who are strong and their reliance upon you. When you realize the government cannot save you from the Great Waves of change, then you will begin to realize your own set of responsibilities and your own gifts and your own strengths.</p>
<p>某种程度上，你在这里是孤身一人。因为政府将不堪重负。你们的社会服务将不堪重负。你们的经济将不堪重负。必须有更大的自力更生，依靠其他强大的个体，以及他们对你的依靠。当你意识到政府无法将你从变革的巨浪中拯救出来时，你将开始意识到你自身的责任、你自身的礼物和你自身的力量。</p>
<p>Do not wait until the clouds darken. Do not wait until economies begin to collapse. Do not wait until humanity begins to run out of its essential resources. Do not wait until political and economic instability reaches a critical juncture. Do not only be concerned. Do not only be worried because you must take action.</p>
<p>不要等到阴云密布。不要等到经济开始崩溃。不要等到人类开始耗尽其基本资源。不要等到政治和经济不稳定达到关键时刻。不要仅仅担忧。不要仅仅因为你必须采取行动而感到担忧。</p>
<p>If you do not take action, you will not find any confidence. You will not believe in your abilities. And you will not experience your own courage, strength and determination.</p>
<p>如果你不采取行动，你就不会找到任何信心。你不会相信你的能力。你也不会感受到你自身的勇气、力量和决心。</p>
<p>The Great Waves will come. The degree of the impact will be determined by the degree to which people have foreseen them and have prepared for them accordingly. In any case, it will not be easy. But you can prevent disaster.</p>
<p>巨浪即将来临。其影响程度将取决于人们对其的预见程度和相应的准备程度。无论如何，这绝非易事。但你可以预防灾难。</p>
<p>If you see the situation clearly, you will recognize the power of the events of your time. You will see that humanity has reached a great threshold that will determine its freedom and its future. That is how great these times are.</p>
<p>如果你清晰地看待形势，你就会认识到你所在时代事件的力量。你会看到，人类已经到达了一个决定其自由和未来的伟大门槛。这就是这个时代如此伟大的原因。</p>
<p>It is not the end. It is the beginning. It is not the final curtain call for humanity. It is the beginning of the next act.</p>
<p>它不是结束，而是开始。它不是人类的谢幕，而是下一幕的开始。</p>
<p>God has sent a New Message into the world to warn humanity of the Great Waves of change and of its emergence into a Greater Community of intelligent life in the universe. God’s New Message will teach about spirituality at the level of Knowledge, beyond the level of ideals and beliefs. It is here to prepare humanity for a future that will be unlike the past and for your encounter and destiny within a Greater Community of life in the universe. It is here to teach humanity Knowledge and Wisdom from the Greater Community—Knowledge and Wisdom that has never been brought into the world before, for it was not needed until now.</p>
<p>上帝向世界发送了一条新讯息，警示人类变革的巨浪，以及它向宇宙智能生命大社区的迈进。上帝的新讯息将在内识层面，超越想法和信仰的层面，教导精神性。它在此帮助人类为一个不同于过去的未来，为你们在宇宙生命大社区内的相遇和天命进行准备。它在此教导人类来自大社区的内识和智慧——这些内识和智慧此前从未被带入世界，因为直到现在才被需要。</p>
<p>You are living in times of Revelation. You are also living in times of cataclysm. Do not take your life lightly, for you must take it seriously. Do not think these times are just like other times, for they are not the same. Do not think your future will be assured, for it is not assured. Do not think your nation is assured, for it is not assured.</p>
<p>你正生活在启示的时代。你也正生活在大灾变的时代。不要轻视你的生命，因为你必须认真对待它。不要认为这些时间与其他时间一样，因为它们并不相同。不要认为你的未来会有保障，因为它并非如此。不要认为你的国家会有保障，因为它并非如此。</p>
<p>You will respond either with strength or with rejection, depending on whether you choose strength or weakness within yourselves. This is the decision.</p>
<p>你会以坚强或拒绝来回应，这取决于你自身内在选择坚强还是软弱。这就是决定。</p>
<p>Part of you is wise, part of you is unwise. Part of you can prepare, part of you will not want to prepare. Part of you can see, part of you is too afraid to see. Part of you is strong, part of you is weak. Part of you has courage, part of you has no courage. Part of you is determined, and part of you has no determination.</p>
<p>你的一部分是明智的，一部分是不明智的。你的一部分想要准备，一部分却不愿准备。你的一部分可以看见，一部分因恐惧而不愿去看。你的一部分坚强，一部分软弱。你的一部分勇敢，一部分缺乏勇气。你的一部分坚定，一部分缺乏决心。</p>
<p>Decision is very fundamental. What will people choose? What will you choose?</p>
<p>决策至关重要。人们会选择什么？你会选择什么？</p>
<p>Your first step is to see the great thresholds that you are approaching, to look with courage and as much objectivity as you can muster—to see the signs from the world, and to heed the signs from within yourself.</p>
<p>你的第一步是看清你正在接近的伟大门槛，带着勇气和尽可能客观的态度去看——去发现来自世界的迹象，并留意来自你自己内心的迹象。</p>
<p>Here it is necessary to begin the deep evaluation of your life and circumstances to see what really can be sustained and what will have strength in the face of the Great Waves of change. This will give you incentives to settle your little problems so you can take on the greater challenges of your life.</p>
<p>在这里，有必要开始深度评估你的生命和境况，看清什么真正能够维系，什么将在变革的巨浪面前拥有力量。这将激励你去解决你的小问题，这样你就能应对你生命中更伟大的挑战。</p>
<p>It will give you the perspective and the understanding you will need to act courageously and swiftly in most cases—to clear up the confusion of your life; to withdraw from places you are losing energy and vitality; to step away from that which cannot be resolved; to step away from people and situations that are weakening you, and dissuading you, and reminding you that you are weak and incapable.</p>
<p>它将为你提供在大多数情况下勇敢而迅速采取行动所需的视角和理解——清理你生命中的困惑；退出你正在失去能量和活力的地方；远离那些无法解决的问题；远离那些削弱你、劝阻你、提醒你软弱无能的人和事。</p>
<p>You have to build your ark, and you have to assist others. This takes precedence over everything. This changes everything. This puts everything in a different light. This reveals things about yourself and about others that you did not see before.</p>
<p>你必须建造你的方舟，你必须帮助他人。这比一切都更重要。这改变了一切。这让一切都焕然一新。这揭示了你从未见过的关于你自己和他人的真理。</p>
<p>Here you can see strength and wisdom in others. Here you can see all the manifestations of weakness. Here you cannot save the world, for you must save yourself and others who are close to you, and then reach out to others who are vulnerable in your community who cannot prepare themselves.</p>
<p>在此你能看到他人身上的力量和智慧。在此你能看到所有软弱的展现。在此你无法拯救世界，因为你必须拯救你自己和你身边的其他人，然后去触及你社群中那些无法自我准备的脆弱者。</p>
<p>Here your ideas about politics and religion—your beliefs, your convictions, everything—must be re-evaluated. For you cannot rely upon these things and have any certainty in approaching the future.</p>
<p>在这里，你关于政治和宗教的想法——你的信仰、你的信念，一切——都必须被重新评估。因为你不能依靠这些东西，而对未来抱有任何确定性。</p>
<p>Perhaps you will think it is a great misfortune you are facing, a great inconvenience. But in essence it is the thing that can save your life, restore your value and your strength, and call forth your greater gifts from you.</p>
<p>或许你会认为你正面临着巨大的不幸，巨大的不便。但本质上，它能够拯救你的生命，恢复你的价值和力量，并激发你更伟大的礼物。</p>
<p>Redemption can be found in the most unfortunate circumstances. A miracle can occur in the face of great tragedy and difficulty. It all depends on what you choose within yourself, and what you follow within yourself, and how you respond to the world around you, and whether you will choose strength or weakness as your foundation.</p>
<p>即使在最不幸的情况下也能找到救赎。在巨大的悲剧和困境面前，奇迹也可能出现。这一切都取决于你内心的选择，你内心的追随，你如何回应周围的世界，以及你选择以坚强还是软弱作为你的根基。</p>
<p>Look at the world without judgment, and you will begin to see things and feel things and know things. Look at yourself in meditation without judgments, and you will begin to see things, feel things and know things. Look at your relationships and involvements with others objectively, and you will see things you did not see before. Ask the right questions, and the real answers will appear.</p>
<p>不带评判地看待世界，你就会开始看见事物、感受到事物、知道事物。不带评判地在冥想中审视你自己，你就会开始看见事物、感受到事物、知道事物。客观地审视你与他人的关系和参与，你会看到以前未曾看到的事情。提出正确的问题，真正的答案就会出现。</p>
<p>The Creator of all life has provided guidelines for preparing for the Great Waves of change. God has provided a Revelation of the future. It is speaking to the Power of Knowledge within you. It is speaking to people of all religious traditions and to people who have no religious tradition to respond to the great needs of the world and the great events of your time—calling people to respond to the power and the presence of Knowledge within themselves, and to give this greater priority than their beliefs, their admonitions, their convictions and their traditions. This is how you reconnect with God, by responding to what God has given you to see, to know and to do.</p>
<p>所有生命的创造者提供了指引，用于为变革的巨浪进行准备。上帝提供了一个未来的启示。它正在对你内在内识的力量讲话。它正在对所有宗教传统的人们以及没有宗教传统的人们讲话，去回应世界的伟大需求和你们时代的伟大事件——召唤人们回应他们内在内识的力量和存在，并赋予它比他们的信仰、他们的训诫、他们的信念和他们的传统更优先的地位。这就是你重新联接上帝的方式，通过回应上帝赋予你去看、去知道和去做的事情。</p>
<p>You do not have to belong to a religion, or go to the temple or the mosque or the church to have this experience. Here your experience of the Divine will be pure and will occur either within or without the context of religion.</p>
<p>你无需信仰任何宗教，也无需前往寺庙、清真寺或教堂，即可拥有这种体验。在这里，你对神圣的体验将是纯粹的，无论是否在宗教的框架内。</p>
<p>For God is everywhere. God is here. But God is speaking through Knowledge within you. This is how God speaks to you and guides you.</p>
<p>因为上帝无处不在。上帝就在这里。但上帝通过你内在的内识进行讲话。这就是上帝对你讲话和指引你的方式。</p>
<p>Learn to listen. Learn to tell the difference between your thoughts or your compulsions and the power and the presence of Knowledge. Take the Steps to Knowledge to learn how to connect with the greater power that God has given you. Learn to be humble and open, but wise and discerning. Gain the strength to question your own beliefs and past assumptions, and gain the vision to see the signs that the world is giving you—telling you what is coming and what you must do to prepare.</p>
<p>学习聆听。学习分辨你的想法或冲动与内识的力量和存在之间的区别。开展内识进阶，学习如何联接上帝赋予你的更伟大力量。学习谦逊和开放，但也要智慧和辨识。获得质疑你自身信仰和过往假设的力量，获得洞察世界正在赋予你的征象的远见——它告诉你即将发生什么，以及你必须做什么来准备。</p>
<p>God will redeem you through even the worst circumstances, and sometimes the worst circumstances have the greatest opportunity in this regard. But do not take the Great Waves of change lightly. Do not think that you can avoid disaster by simply avoiding reality.</p>
<p>即使在最糟糕的境遇中，上帝也会救赎你，有时最糟糕的境遇恰恰蕴藏着最大的救赎机会。但切勿轻视变革的巨浪。不要认为仅仅逃避现实就能避免灾难。</p>
<p>It will be the courageous efforts of people everywhere that will turn the tide for the human family. Wise leadership will help, wise guidance and counsel will help, but without the strength of the individual, the commitment of the individual, then humanity’s future cannot be assured.</p>
<p>正是世界各地人民的勇敢努力，才能扭转人类大家庭的命运。明智的领导会有所帮助，明智的指导和忠告也会有所帮助，但如果没有个人的力量，没有个人的奉献，人类的未来就无法得到保障。</p>
<p>This is all about you and why you came into the world, for you came to be in the world to face the Great Waves of change. It is no accident that you are here at this time. This has everything to do with you—who you are and what you are here to accomplish.</p>
<p>这一切都与你有关，与你为何来到这个世界有关，因为你来到这个世界是为了面对变革的巨浪。你此刻身处此地并非偶然。这一切都与你息息相关——你是谁，你来此是为了成就什么。</p>
<p>Therefore, it is a calling. It is a recognition. It is a deeper reckoning within yourself. And it is a recognition in the human family that it will have to live differently in the world and unite to protect the world—to protect the world from internal collapse and to protect the world from intervention from beyond.</p>
<p>因此，它是一种召唤。它是一种认知。它是一种你自己内在更深层次的清算。它也是人类大家庭的一种认知：它将必须以不同的方式生活在世界上，并团结起来保护世界——保护世界免遭内部崩溃，保护世界免遭外来干预。</p>
<p>This has the power to forge a unity that could never be established under any other circumstances. And if this unity is guided by freedom and wisdom, then it will provide humanity a new beginning—a greater beginning, a greater strength and union than it has ever achieved before.</p>
<p>这拥有打造一种在任何其他情况下都无法实现的团结的力量。如果这种团结以自由和智慧为指引，那么它将为人类带来一个新的开端——一个比以往任何时期都更伟大的开端，一种更伟大的力量与团结。</p>
<p>But this strength and union will not be based on ideology, or upon one religious view, or upon convenience or affluence. It will be built upon necessity and forged in the fires of the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>但这种力量和团结并非基于意识形态，或基于某种宗教观点，或基于便利或富裕。它将建立在必要性之上，并在变革巨浪的烈火中锻造。</p>
