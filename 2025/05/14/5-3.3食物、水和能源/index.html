<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on February 19, 2009 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2009 年 2 月 19 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humanity has overspent its natural inheritance. It has overused and misused the world’s resources. It has defiled the waters of the world. It has poisoned the soils of the world. It has attacked and eliminated species of the world. It has filled the air with poisonous gases, particulate matter, pollution of so many kinds.</p>
<p>人类过度消耗了其自然遗产。它过度使用并滥用了世界资源。它污染了世界水域。它毒害了世界土壤。它攻击并消灭了世界物种。它使空气中充满了有毒气体、颗粒物和各种污染物。</p>
<p>You cannot do this without consequences. And to think that the consequences are insignificant, or should not be your primary concern, is literally to push them off into the future to burden your children with them.</p>
<p>你们这样做必然会承担后果。如果你认为后果无关紧要，或者认为后果不应该成为你的首要考虑，那么实际上就是把后果推到未来，让你的孩子承担。</p>
<p>To overuse the world has predictable consequences. But because of greed and recklessness and the unwillingness or inability to think ahead, humanity has now created an era of deprivation. You are now facing a world of declining resources, a world of diminishing assets, a world where a growing population will have to drink from a slowly shrinking well.</p>
<p>过度使用地球的后果是可以预见的。然而，由于贪婪、鲁莽以及不愿或无力深谋远虑，人类如今创造了一个匮乏的时代。你们现在正面临着一个资源日益减少、资产日益缩水的世界，一个不断增长的人口不得不从一口逐渐萎缩的井中汲取水源的世界。</p>
<p>The climates of the world have now been disrupted, which will bring great havoc upon peoples everywhere, disturbing the natural balance to such an extent that it will produce unfavorable conditions for the human family.</p>
<p>当今世界气候已遭到破坏，这将给世界各地的人民带来巨大灾难，扰乱自然平衡，从而给人类大家庭带来不利条件。</p>
<p>Why does humanity overuse its resources? The answer to this can be placed at many different levels of course: greed, irresponsibility, competition, conflict, ignorance, prejudice. The list goes on and on. If these tendencies can be restrained for the welfare of all peoples, then humanity has a much greater chance.</p>
<p>人类为何过度消耗资源？答案当然可以归结于许多不同的层面：贪婪、不负责任、竞争、冲突、无知、偏见。诸如此类，不胜枚举。如果为了全人类的福祉，这些倾向能够得到抑制，那么人类将拥有更伟大的发展机会。</p>
<p>But the impact upon the world is growing, not shrinking. The despoiling of the world is increasing and is not being significantly reduced. So the impact is growing.</p>
<p>但其对世界的影响却在不断增长，而非缩小。对世界的掠夺在不断增加，而且并没有显著减少。所以，其影响正在不断增长。</p>
<p>You are putting on your children the consequences of the actions you take today. They will have to face a much more difficult world, a world with far greater hazards. And they will look back on the greedy generations with contempt, and even with despair. They, even more than you, will bear the brunt of this. The young people today, what kind of world will you pass on to them? What kind of reality will they have to face?</p>
<p>你们正在把今天行为的后果转嫁给你们的孩子们。他们将不得不面对一个更加艰难、更加危险的世界。他们将带着轻蔑甚至绝望回顾这几代贪婪的后代。他们将比你们承受更大的冲击。今天的年轻人，你们将留给他们一个什么样的世界？他们将不得不面对什么样的现实？</p>
<p>People are still blind and reckless. They think the Earth will provide endlessly for their wandering desires. They think that technology will solve any problems in gaining access to resources. This is not the approach of an intelligent race. This is not the approach of a wise race. This is the approach of a reckless race, wild and irresponsible.</p>
<p>人们依然盲目鲁莽。他们认为地球能无止境地满足他们飘忽不定的欲望。他们认为科技能解决任何获取资源的问题。这不是智能种族的做法。这不是明智种族的做法。这是鲁莽、野蛮、不负责任的种族的做法。</p>
<p>There are growing numbers of people today who are beginning to assume a greater responsibility and awareness of these things, but their numbers are very small. And ever-growing numbers of people living in poverty will push humanity to the very brink.</p>
<p>如今，越来越多的人开始承担起更伟大的责任，并觉知到这些事情，但他们的数量仍然非常少。而贫困人口数量的不断增长，将把人类推向崩溃的边缘。</p>
<p>Food, water, energy and all of the things they can provide, such as a stable social structure, the availability of medicines and social security—here the needs of humanity will become more elemental, even in the wealthy nations.</p>
<p>食物、水、能源以及它们所能提供的一切，例如稳定的社会结构、药品的可用性和社会保障——在这里，人类的需求将变得更加基本，即使在富裕的国家也是如此。</p>
<p>At some point, humanity will have to limit consumption because it will be facing a dire set of circumstances. At some point, humanity will have to find a humane way of limiting the human population, or humanity will drive the world into depletion. At some point, nations will have to unite or face mutual collapse.</p>
<p>终有一天，人类将不得不限制消费，因为它将面临一系列严峻的形势。终有一天，人类将不得不找到一种人道的方式来限制人口，否则人类将把世界推向资源枯竭的深渊。终有一天，各国将不得不团结起来，否则将面临共同崩溃。</p>
<p>These things today may be socially unacceptable because the public is not yet aware of the reality of living in a finite world. Some people think that you will go out into space to gain whatever you want, that whatever you have depleted here on Earth, you will find out there.</p>
<p>如今，这些事情或许在社会上难以接受，因为公众尚未意识到生活在有限世界的现实。有些人认为，你们可以去太空获取你们想要的一切，你们在地球上消耗掉的一切，你们都能在那里找到。</p>
<p>But the universe is barren. There are very few worlds such as yours, and the regions within which these worlds exist are owned and governed by other races in the universe who will protect them against any incursion. And they will succeed, for they are far more powerful than humanity is.</p>
<p>但宇宙是贫瘠的。像你们这样的世界寥寥无几，这些世界所在的区域由宇宙中的其他种族拥有和统治，他们将保护这些世界免遭任何入侵。而且他们必将成功，因为他们远比人类强大。</p>
<p>Therefore, you must look to your life to see how you live and what you consume. You may think this would make no difference at all in the larger scheme of things, but in fact everyone has to take responsibility at this level, or humanity is driving itself to collapse.</p>
<p>因此，你必须审视你的生命，看看你如何生活，消费了什么。你或许认为，从宏观角度来看，这根本无关紧要，但事实上，每个人都必须承担起这个层面的责任，否则人类正在走向自我毁灭。</p>
<p>In the future, food will become more difficult to grow, more difficult to distribute and become a subject of contention, competition and conflict. Nations will hoard their productivity or only sell their surplus to other favored nations. There will be less food available for the world.</p>
<p>未来，粮食种植和分配将变得更加困难，并成为争夺、竞争和冲突的焦点。各国将囤积其生产资料，或只将剩余的粮食出售给其他受惠国。世界粮食供应将减少。</p>
<p>Changing climate will have an ever-greater destructive force on humanity’s ability to produce adequate food. And water resources will become ever more scarce, both in the drier regions of the world, and in providing the source of rivers.</p>
<p>气候变化将对人类生产充足粮食的能力产生越来越大的破坏力。水资源将变得越来越稀缺，无论是在世界干旱地区，还是在江河源头。</p>
<p>You can see this today if you will look. It is not a fantasy. It is not a conspiracy. It is not a machination of governments or leaders.</p>
<p>如果你今天留心观察，就能看到这一点。它不是一种幻想。它不是一种阴谋。它不是一种政府或领导人的阴谋。</p>
<p>If humanity really understood its situation, it would impose great restrictions on the productivity of resources, to secure those resources for the future. Conservation would become a primary ethic of every culture, and humanitarian aid to the foreign, desperate, impoverished countries would be very significant.</p>
<p>如果人类真正理解自身的处境，就会对资源的生产力施加严格的限制，以确保这些资源在未来得到充分利用。保护环境将成为每种文化的首要伦理，对外国、绝望的贫困国家的人道主义援助将意义非凡。</p>
<p>Do not think if you live in a wealthy country that your government will be able to protect you against the Great Waves of change that are coming. Do not think that your current privileges and affluence can be assured in any way given these circumstances.</p>
<p>不要认为，如果你生活在一个富裕的国家，你的政府就能保护你免受即将到来的变革巨浪的侵袭。不要认为，在这种情况下，你现有的特权和富裕能够得到任何保障。</p>
<p>The governments should be warning their peoples instead of encouraging gross overconsumption. Governments should be planning for the future. People should be planning for the future.</p>
<p>政府应该警告民众，而不是鼓励过度消费。政府应该为未来做打算。民众也应该为未来做打算。</p>
<p>Think food, water and energy. Where will they come from? How will you acquire them? How will they be distributed to every person? How will they be equitably distributed between nations to prevent war and chaos? This is not simply a question for an expert to consider. It is a problem for every person.</p>
<p>想想食物、水和能源。它们从哪里来？如何获取？如何分配给每个人？如何在各国之间公平分配，以防止战争和动乱？这不仅仅是专家需要考虑的问题。这是每个人面临的问题。</p>
<p>If you have children, you must look at them and think: “How will they survive in a world like this? What will they need to know? What skills will they need to have?” Do not think that you can provide for them an affluent lifestyle, if you have had such a lifestyle. You cannot assure this for them now.</p>
<p>如果你有孩子，你必须看着他们，思考：“在这样的世界里，他们将如何生存？他们需要知道什么？他们需要掌握哪些技能？”不要认为，如果你已经拥有了富裕的生活方式，你就能为他们提供这样的生活。你现在无法保证他们拥有这样的生活。</p>
<p>Technology has its limits. New sources of energy will be found, but it will take a very long time to find them and develop them. Meanwhile, the world is declining.</p>
<p>技术有其局限性。新的能源终将被发现，但发现和开发它们将需要很长时间。与此同时，世界正在走向衰落。</p>
<p>Governments would respond if their peoples demanded preparations, demanded that their government take primary action here. But that is not the criteria; that is not what governments are focusing on.</p>
<p>如果民众要求做好准备，要求政府采取主要行动，各国政府就会做出回应。但这不是标准，也不是各国政府关注的重点。</p>
<p>So you can begin to see, if you are willing to look with clear eyes, the great problems that humanity is facing here in the world, the great tribulation this can produce, the great economic and political instability that will result.</p>
<p>因此，如果你愿意用清晰的眼睛去看，你就会开始看到人类在这个世界上所面临的巨大问题、这可能产生的巨大磨难、以及由此造成的巨大经济和政治不稳定。</p>
<p>Today governments are insolvent. Large institutions are insolvent. Individual households are insolvent. It is the beginning of the reality. So if you have the courage to look, you will find yourself at a loss for an explanation or a solution. For it will take ten thousand solutions to resolve this, and some of them are far beyond what you are considering today.</p>
<p>如今，政府破产了。大型机构破产了。个体家庭破产了。这就是现实的开端。所以，如果你有勇气去审视，你会发现你自己无从解释，也找不到解决方案。因为解决这个问题需要一万种方案，其中一些方案远远超出了你今天所能考虑的范围。</p>
<p>Where then will you find the strength to face this? Where will you find the courage, the strength and the inspiration to change your own life, to bring your own life into greater balance and simplicity? Where will you find the vision and the guidance to navigate the difficult and uncertain times ahead? What will you teach your children? What skills and awareness must they have to face a world in decline?</p>
<p>那么，你将从哪里找到力量来面对这一切？你将从哪里找到勇气、力量和灵感来改变你的生命，让你的生命更加平衡、更加简单？你将从哪里找到远见和指引，来应对未来充满挑战和不确定性的时期？你将教给你的孩子什么？他们必须具备哪些技能和觉知来面对一个正在衰落的世界？</p>
<p>The Creator of all life has given you the power of Knowledge. Knowledge is not deceived. Knowledge is not afraid. Knowledge is not discouraged. Knowledge is not living in denial. Knowledge is not guided by fantasy or preference. It is here to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to a greater life of service in the world, and a greater fulfillment that such a service can provide.</p>
<p>所有生命的创造者赋予了你内识的力量。内识不会被欺骗。内识不会害怕。内识不会灰心丧气。内识不会活在否认之中。内识不受幻想或偏好的引导。它在此指引你，保护你，引领你走向一个更伟大的服务世界的生命，以及这种服务所能提供的更伟大的成就。</p>
<p>To be without Knowledge is to live with a set of failing assumptions. It is to live blindly and foolishly, to live driven by desire and fear. It is a reckless, unstable life, a life that cannot foresee what is coming, a life that will be unprepared for the eventualities. You will only be able to escape fear and a sense of helplessness here under the guidance and the power of Knowledge.</p>
<p>没有内识，你就生活在一系列失败的假设之中。它的生活是盲目而愚蠢的，被欲望和恐惧所驱使。它是一种鲁莽、不稳定的生活，一种无法预见未来的生命，一种对不测事件毫无准备的生命。在此，你只有在内识的指引和力量下，才能逃离恐惧和无助感。</p>
<p>This warning, then, and this prescription is a gift of profound love for you from the Creator of all life, for God would not leave humanity unaware or unprepared for the world to come.</p>
<p>那么，这个警告和这个处方是所有生命的创造者对你深厚的爱的礼物，因为上帝不会让人类对未来的世界毫无察觉或毫无准备。</p>
<p>If you want to know what your priorities are, in terms of establishing and maintaining stability, you must think in terms of food, water and energy. These will become ever more important and significant, not only to governments or to experts, but to average citizens—and not just citizens living in drought-stricken parts of the world, or impoverished nations, but everywhere.</p>
<p>如果你想要知道在建立和维护稳定方面的优先事项，你必须考虑粮食、水和能源。这些将变得越来越重要和意义非凡，不仅对政府或专家如此，对普通民众也是如此——不仅仅是生活在世界干旱地区或贫困国家的民众，而是所有地方。</p>
<p>If you live in an affluent nation, look at all of the things that you depend upon that you use without question, always assuming they will be there for you. Imagine what it would be like if these things became unavailable, or even interrupted.</p>
<p>如果你生活在一个富裕的国家，想想你依赖的一切，你总是毫不犹豫地使用它们，总是假设它们会一直为你服务。想象一下，如果这些东西变得不可用，甚至中断，会是什么样子。</p>
<p>You turn on the faucet; there is water. You flick the switch; there are lights and power for everything. You go to the store; it is full of food. You go to the petrol station; it is full of petrol. You go to the stores; their shelves are full. You live in such abundance. Even if you cannot afford everything, you still live in abundance.</p>
<p>你打开水龙头，水就来了。你轻轻一按开关，灯亮了，一切都有电了。你去商店，里面摆满了食物。你去加油站，里面装满了汽油。你去商店，货架上摆满了东西。你们的生活如此富足。即使你买不起所有东西，你仍然生活在富足之中。</p>
<p>But this will not carry into the future, as you have known it. And the price of everything will become greater because it will be more difficult to acquire and to transport.</p>
<p>但正如你所知，这种情况不会延续到未来。所有东西的价格都会变得更高，因为获取和运输将更加困难。</p>
<p>This is an extremely valuable awareness because it throws you back on yourself. Where will you place your faith now? Where will you find strength and certainty and courage? What will you believe in? What will you trust? How will you provide for your children, and how will they be able to provide for themselves when they are grown?</p>
<p>这是一种极其宝贵的觉知，因为它让你重新审视你自己。现在，你的信仰将寄托于何处？你将在哪里找到力量、确定性和勇气？你将相信什么？你将信任什么？你将如何养活你的孩子？他们长大后又将如何自食其力？</p>
<p>You will look around at everyone else who seems to be living in a kind of dream, and you will be so dismayed. The people are asleep. The Great Waves are coming, and people are lying on the beach.</p>
<p>环顾四周，你会发现每个人都仿佛活在梦境中，你会感到无比沮丧。人们都睡着了。巨浪袭来，人们躺在沙滩上。</p>
<p>People are mesmerized. People are caught up. People are giving a great amount of time, energy and resources to things of no significance. People are self-obsessed. And the alarms are sounding everywhere. But who is listening? Who is watching? Who is paying attention? If you think that others are doing this for you, then you are living blind.</p>
<p>人们被迷惑了。人们被困住了。人们把大量的时间、精力和资源投入到毫无意义的事情上。人们沉迷于自我。警报声四处响起。但谁在听？谁在看？谁在关注？如果你认为别人在为你做这些，那你就生活在盲目之中。</p>
<p>Every parent should be very concerned about the condition of the world—about food, water and energy and all that they provide. Every leader of government and religion should be speaking about this. Every person who is in a position of responsibility or social power should be concerned with this. Every person who possesses wealth should be greatly concerned with this, for this wealth is not assured now and could be undone by forces that the person could be completely unaware of.</p>
<p>每位父母都应该非常关心世界的状况——食物、水、能源以及它们所提供的一切。每个政府和宗教领袖都应该谈论这一点。每位身居要职或拥有社会权力的人都应该关注这一点。每位拥有财富的人都应该高度关注这一点，因为这些财富现在并无保障，而且可能会被那些他们完全没有意识到的力量所摧毁。</p>
<p>It is disconcerting to think of these things. It is disruptive to one’s life. It can produce immense fear and anxiety. But these are only the first responses. Beyond this, you want to gain a place of clarity, objectivity and determination.</p>
<p>想到这些事情令人不安。它会扰乱一个人的生命，并可能产生巨大的恐惧和焦虑。但这些只是最初的反应。除此之外，你还需要获得清晰、客观和坚定的心态。</p>
<p>If you stay afraid and do nothing, well, you will lose confidence in yourself and in everything else. So you must begin to respond and to act and to take action regarding the simple things of your life first, that you can fix easily—reduce your possessions, simplify your life, save energy, learn how to grow food. In the future, everyone, or nearly everyone, will have to be growing food.</p>
<p>如果你一直心存恐惧，什么也不做，那么你就会对你自己和一切失去信心。所以你必须开始应对，采取行动，先从生命中那些简单的事情开始，那些你可以轻松解决的事情——减少你的物品，简化你的生活，节约能源，学习如何种植食物。在未来，每个人，或者几乎每个人，都必须种植食物。</p>
<p>In a way, humanity is creating a situation that can bring it back to a far simpler life, a more authentic life, a life more connected to nature and to the land, a life where there could be a far simpler social interaction and set of priorities.</p>
<p>从某种程度上来说，人类正在创造一种可以回归到更简单的生活、更真实的生活、与自然和土地联系更紧密生活的状态，一种社会互动和优先事项更简单的生活。</p>
<p>Technology and the fantasies about technology have disassociated people from one another, from the realities of life, from the meaning of their existence. While technology has produced wonderful benefits, powerful medicines, great remedies for so many things, it has also destroyed the basic social fabric of human society to a very great extent. So to gain the rewards and to limit the liabilities of this is very important.</p>
<p>科技以及对科技的幻想使人们彼此疏离，脱离了生命的现实，也脱离了生存的意义。科技虽然带来了许多奇妙的益处、强大的药物和灵丹妙药，但它也在很大程度上摧毁了人类社会的基本结构。因此，获取科技带来的回报并限制其带来的负面影响至关重要。</p>
<p>Those who do well in the future will be prepared for the future. They will have taken the shock of recognizing the true situation at hand, and they will have passed beyond the fear and trepidation to a state of greater discernment and responsibility. They are not waiting for leaders, or governments, or institutions to tell them the truth. They are trying to discern this themselves.</p>
<p>那些在未来取得成功的人，将会为未来做好准备。他们将承受着认清眼前真实情况的冲击，他们将超越恐惧和不安，迈向更敏锐的辨别力和责任感。他们不会等待领导人、政府或机构告诉他们真相。他们正在努力自己去辨别真相。</p>
<p>The revelations that are being given here will be very helpful because there is no compromise in what is being presented here. There is no self-interest here. There is no delusion or fantasy here.</p>
<p>这里给出的启示将会非常有帮助，因为这里呈现的内容没有妥协。这里没有私利。这里没有妄想或幻想。</p>
<p>People may respond in a delusional way. They may go into denial. They may think it is all about something else. They may be unable to face this. But the reality that We are presenting is very true, very clear and very discernible.</p>
<p>人们的反应可能带有妄想色彩。他们可能会否认。他们可能认为这一切都与别的事情有关。他们可能无法面对这一切。但我们呈现的现实却非常真实、清晰且显而易见。</p>
<p>You do not have to be an expert or a genius to see that if you overuse the world, it will deprive you, and that humanity’s impact upon the world has been so destructive for so long that the consequences are now coming; the payment is coming due; the true costs of humanity’s disruption of the world and misuse of the world are now producing ever-increasing impacts.</p>
<p>你不需要是专家或天才就能看到，如果你们过度使用这个世界，它就会剥夺你们，而且人类对世界的影响长期以来是如此具有破坏性，以至于后果现在即将到来；代价即将到来；人类破坏世界和滥用世界的真正代价正在产生越来越大的影响。</p>
<p>After you go through your initial shock and dismay, it is time to return to Knowledge. It is time to begin to set out a plan for yourself, a plan that is based upon a deep evaluation of your situation—where you stand in your relationship with people, with possessions, how you live, where you live, how you travel. It is time to re-evaluate your plans and goals and expectations.</p>
<p>在你经历最初的震惊和沮丧之后，是时候回归内识了。是时候开始为你自己设定一个计划，一个基于对你处境的深度评估的计划——你与他人的关系、与财产的关系、你的生活方式、你居住的地方、你如何旅行。是时候重新评估你的计划、目标和期望了。</p>
<p>Here you do not give up hope. You do not capitulate to fear or cynicism. But you do have to re-evaluate what you are doing and where you think you are going in life. And you re-evaluate this in the light of the Great Waves of change, in the light of the real situation facing humanity, in the light of the fact that only a very few people will become aware and will really prepare for what is to come, sowing the seeds for future panic and social disorder.</p>
<p>在此你不会放弃希望。你不会屈服于恐惧或愤世嫉俗。但你确实必须重新评估你正在做什么，以及你认为你的生命将走向何方。你根据变革的巨浪，根据人类面临的真实境况，根据只有极少数人会察觉并真正为即将到来的事情做好准备，播下未来恐慌和社会混乱的种子这一事实，来重新评估这一点。</p>
<p>Do not think you should move out into the country far away, for the three basic things you will need will be far more unavailable there. There is a danger of isolation there.</p>
<p>不要想着搬到遥远的乡下去，因为你需要的三样基本东西在那里会更加难得。那里有被孤立的危险。</p>
<p>Knowledge will guide you step by step, but you must face your real need here. You must face the realities of the world. You must recognize that your ideas and your assumptions and your hopes and wishes will not be sufficient to prepare you or to guide you now. This will require great self-reliance, and a great reliance on others who are strong with Knowledge.</p>
<p>内识将一步步指引你，但你必须面对你在此的真正需求。你必须面对世界的现实。你必须认识到，你的想法、你的假设、你的希望和愿望现在不足以让你进行准备或指引你。这将需要巨大的自力更生，以及对那些拥有强大内识的人的巨大依赖。</p>
<p>People will think there are simple solutions, new technologies that will take care of all these things, but they have no idea what they are looking at. They want to have a simple solution so the problem will go away and not be a problem for them. But there are no simple solutions now. There are only demanding solutions, requiring ever-greater responsibility and adaptation.</p>
<p>人们会认为有简单的解决方案，有新技术可以解决所有这些问题，但他们根本不知道他们在寻找什么。他们希望有一个简单的解决方案，这样问题就会消失，不再成为他们的麻烦。但现在没有简单的解决方案。只有要求更高的解决方案，需要更大的责任感和适应能力。</p>
<p>The Creator of all life does not want to see you fail, does not want to see you overcome, does not want to see your great opportunity in this life destroyed out of ignorance and neglect. That is why God’s New Message is providing a warning about the Great Waves of change; and a warning about the dangers of Contact with intelligent life in the universe; and a warning against following your fantasies, your prejudices and your condemnation—for these things all blind you and render you unable and unwilling to respond to the realities of life and to the signs the world is giving you now about what is happening now and what is to come. Here you prepare for a future that you see and feel, not for a future that you want or that you prefer.</p>
<p>所有生命的创造者不愿看到你们的失败，不愿看到你们被击败，不愿看到你此生的伟大机会因为无知和忽视而被毁掉。正因如此，上帝的新讯息发出了关于变革巨浪的警告；关于与宇宙智能生命接触的危险的警告；以及关于不要追随你的空想、你的偏见和你的谴责的警告——因为这些东西全都蒙蔽了你，让你无法也不愿回应生命的现实，以及世界现在正在给予你们的关于正在发生什么以及即将发生什么的征兆。在这里，你为一个你看见和感受到的未来做准备，而非为一个你想要或你偏好的未来做准备。</p>
<p>You can see here that this will require a tremendously deep evaluation of your situation—not only your outer circumstances, but where your mind is focused, where you are placing priorities, where you are spending your energy and your resources. What you feel is important today may have no meaning in the future. And for so many people, their priorities are out of sync with reality.</p>
<p>由此可见，这需要你对你处境进行极其深入的评估——不仅是你的外部环境，还包括你的心灵焦点、你的优先事项、你的能量和资源的投入。你今天认为重要的事情，在未来可能毫无意义。而对许多人来说，他们的优先事项与现实并不同​​步。</p>
<p>So there must be this deep evaluation, you see, and it will be ongoing. But it must be very thorough. If you are willing to take the Steps to Knowledge, this evaluation will become much simpler and easier to accomplish, for Knowledge is not deceived by anything. It will only respond to that which is true and necessary, and will not respond to anything else.</p>
<p>所以，你看，必须有这种深度的评估，而且它将持续进行。但它必须非常彻底。如果你愿意开展内识进阶，这种评估将变得更加简单，更加容易完成，因为内识不会被任何事物欺骗。它只会回应那些真实和必要的事物，而不会回应任何其他事物。</p>
<p>Here your range of concern is reduced down to an essential and elemental focus. Here instead of trying to solve other people’s problems or the problems of the world, you begin to concentrate on what is essential for yourself and your children, and for other people who might be extremely vulnerable—the elderly, the infirm and members of your family who would be vulnerable.</p>
<p>在这里，你的关注范围被缩减至一个本质的、基本的焦点。在这里，你不再试图解决他人的问题或世界的问题，而是开始关注对你自己、你的孩子，以及其他可能极其脆弱的人——老年人、体弱者以及你的家庭成员——至关重要的事情。</p>
<p>Naturally, you will begin to exert pressure on your local governments and your leaders. Do not assume they are wise and well informed. They will need to hear from you. And you will have to be very strong—stronger than you are today, more focused than you are today, more concentrated than you are today. This will bring your life into focus and clarity, and enable you to find the source of your strength in the deeper Knowledge that lives within you.</p>
<p>自然而然地，你将开始向你的地方政府和你的领导人施加压力。不要认为他们睿智且见多识广。他们需要听到你的声音。你必须非常强大——比你今天更加强大，比你今天更加专注，比你今天更加集中。这将使你的生命进入专注和明晰，并使你能够在你内在的更深层次的内识中找到你的力量源泉。</p>
<p>People’s first response to all this is to think, “Oh, what a tragedy! This is a great inconvenience to my life. How could this happen? Who should I blame? Where should I go? What must I do?” And they run around in a big panic.</p>
<p>人们面对这一切的第一反应是想：“哦，真是一场悲剧！这给我的生活带来了极大的不便。怎么会发生这种事？我该怪谁？我该去哪里？我该怎么办？”然后他们惊慌失措地四处逃窜。</p>
<p>What may take time to see is that you were born for these times. You were destined to enter the world at a time when humanity would be facing these Great Waves of change. Your higher purpose in coming here is connected to this, for this is the greater context of life into which you will be functioning increasingly as time goes on.</p>
<p>或许需要一些时间才能看清的是，你生来就是为了这个时代。你注定要在人类面临巨变浪潮的时期来到这个世界。你来到此地的更高宗旨与此息息相关，因为这是更伟大的生命背景，随着时间的推移，你将越来越多地在其中发挥作用。</p>
<p>Of course, people will resist this realization. They will fight against it. They will insist upon solutions. They will think their leaders or their scientists will take care of the problem for them. They will complain endlessly. They will be angry. They will be upset when they find out they cannot avoid all of this. They will blame other peoples, other nations, other groups. They will act foolishly. They will panic. They will encourage people to come to power in government who will be dangerous and oppressive. Because they are not seeing, they are not prepared.</p>
<p>当然，人们会抵制这种认识。他们会与之抗争。他们会坚持寻求解决方案。他们会认为他们的领导人或科学家会替他们解决问题。他们会无休止地抱怨。他们会愤怒。当他们发现他们无法避免这一切时，他们会感到沮丧。他们会责怪其他民族、其他国家、其他群体。他们会愚蠢行事。他们会惊慌失措。他们会鼓励那些危险且压迫性的人上台执政。因为他们没有预见到，所以他们没有做好准备。</p>
<p>If you are prepared and you are preparing your life, then these things have less and less of an impact in producing fear and uncertainty.</p>
<p>如果你做好了准备，并且正在为你的生命做准备，那么这些事情对产生恐惧和不确定性的影响就会越来越小。</p>
<p>It is like having a child. If you are prepared for having a child, if you have built a financial foundation, if you have a strong and secure relationship, if you are emotionally ready, if you have gained the maturity to be prepared to raise a family, having a child—though challenging—is a very wonderful thing.</p>
<p>它就像生孩子一样。如果你做好了生孩子的准备，如果你已经建立了经济基础，如果你拥有稳固而稳定的感情，如果你在情感上做好了准备，如果你已经成熟到可以养育家庭，那么生孩子——尽管充满挑战——也是一件非常美好的事情。</p>
<p>But for people who are not ready, who do not have a financial foundation, who do not have a stable and secure relationship, who are not mature or emotionally ready, well, it is almost like a disaster.</p>
<p>但对于那些还没有准备好、没有经济基础、没有稳定安全的关系、不成熟或情感上没有准备好的人来说，它几乎就像一场灾难。</p>
<p>So readiness and preparation are essential to meet all of the great opportunities and challenges of life. And the degree of this awareness and preparation will determine the outcome, and whether the great changes to come can be beneficial for humanity or whether they will be utterly destructive.</p>
<p>因此，做好准备和准备对于迎接生命中所有伟大机遇和挑战至关重要。而这种认知和准备的程度将决定最终结果，以及即将到来的变革究竟是造福人类，还是带来彻底的破坏。</p>
<p>You cannot determine that for everyone, but you must determine it for yourself, and begin to think now of yourself as a person who is preparing for the Great Waves of change, who is engaged with the world, who is looking out over the horizon to see what is coming.</p>
<p>你无法为每个人确定这一点，但你必须为你自己确定这一点，并开始将你自己视为一个正在为变革的巨浪进行准备的人，一个正在与世界互动的人，一个正在眺望地平线以预见未来的人。</p>
<p>If you can do this while building the deeper connection to Knowledge, by taking the Steps to Knowledge, you will find the strength, the wisdom and the certainty to proceed. You will not fall prey to errant thinking and foolish assumptions. And you will not panic and run when the difficulties begin to arise.</p>
<p>如果你能做到这一点，同时通过开展内识进阶，构建与内识的更深层次的联接，你将找到前行的力量、智慧和确定性。你将不会沦为错误思维和愚蠢假设的牺牲品。当困难开始出现时，你也不会惊慌失措地逃跑。</p>
<p>Already the world is in financial hazard. It is a prelude to greater difficulties to come. Do not sit and complain. Do not sit and judge others. Do not sit and just try to understand the problems. Look to your life.</p>
<p>世界已深陷金融危机。这是更大困境的前兆。别坐着抱怨。别坐着评判他人。别坐着，试着去理解问题所在。看看你的生命。</p>
<p>Is your work secure? Will it be secure into the future? Do you live in a place where you could function without the use of an automobile? Do you know what resources your community can provide? And how can you support your community in providing these resources? Are you becoming educated, and are you educating others in a constructive manner?</p>
<p>你的工作有保障吗？未来还会有保障吗？你居住的地方是否无需汽车就能正常生活？你知道你的社区可以提供哪些资源吗？你又如何支持你的社区提供这些资源？你是否正在接受教育？你是否正在以建设性的方式教育他人？</p>
<p>You do not want to just scare people here. You have to give them things to do. You have to provide guidance. And the New Message from God provides the beginning guidelines for preparing for all of these things.</p>
<p>你不想只是吓唬这里的人们。你必须给他们事情做。你必须提供指引。而来自上帝的新讯息提供了为所有这些事情做准备的初步指导。</p>
<p>The more people who are prepared, the safer your communities will be, and the stronger your local governments will be. Look at all the empty lots in your town and city, and see where food could be grown, and how healthy this would be for people to be engaged in these activities.</p>
<p>准备充分的人越多，社区就越安全，地方政府也就越强大。看看你所在城镇的空地，看看哪里可以种植粮食，以及从事这些活动对人们的健康有多大益处。</p>
<p>It is time to turn off the television and the radio, and begin to get to work. This will be redemptive to you and restorative. You change the outcome by adding every little bit of productive activity and dedication.</p>
<p>是时候关掉电视和收音机，开始工作了。这会对你起到救赎和恢复的作用。你可以通过一点点的积极活动和奉献来改变结果。</p>
<p>It is like a scale. On one side is a huge weight, and you wonder how could you ever counterbalance the weight of human destructiveness and ignorance. And all you have to add to the other side of the scale is a penny, a little coin. You say, “My god, this will have no impact at all.” But if you put your penny on the scale, and other people put their pennies on the scale, eventually the scale is equalized and is tipped in your favor.</p>
<p>它就像一架天平。一边是巨大的砝码，你不禁纳闷，你该如何平衡人类破坏性和无知的重量。而你只需在天平的另一边加一分钱，一枚小小的硬币。你会说：“我的天，这根本没什么影响。” 但如果你把你的一分钱放在天平上，其他人也把他们的一分钱放在天平上，最终天平会趋于平衡，对你有利。</p>
<p>Never underestimate what an individual can do when guided by the power and the presence of Knowledge. Humanity’s fate and outcome has been altered by the contributions of individuals and very small groups of people—the great discoveries, the great accomplishments, the great humanitarians, the great inventors, the great leaders.</p>
<p>永远不要低估一个人在内识的力量和指引下所能成就的一切。人类的命运和结局，因个人和极少数群体的贡献而改变——伟大的发现、伟大的成就、伟大的人道主义者、伟大的发明家、伟大的领袖。</p>
<p>Do not underestimate the power of your contribution. If you are guided by Knowledge and you are committed, you will find inner resolution, you will find inner strength, and you will find an escape from self-doubt and self-denial. You will find the power and strength that God has put within you that is meant to be discovered and contributed to the world. The Great Waves of change give you the greatest incentive for this. There is great moral hazard here in neglecting this.</p>
<p>别低估你贡献的力量。如果你受到内识的指引，并且你全身心投入，你将找到内在的决心，你将找到内在的力量，你将找到摆脱自我怀疑和自我否定的出口。你将找到上帝赋予你内在的力量和实力，它注定要被发现并贡献给世界。变革的巨浪赋予你对此的最大激励。忽视这一点会带来极大的道德风险。</p>
<p>You have time to prepare. Time is precious. Do not assume it will be there for you in the future. Every day, every month, every year is very significant in the movement of the great events. In five years time, the world will be very different, and your options will be far more limited, and the situation can be much more grave than it appears to be today.</p>
<p>你有时间做准备。时间宝贵。不要认为将来还会有时间。在重大事件的进程中，每一天、每一月、每一年都至关重要。五年后，世界将大不相同，你的选择将更加有限，形势也可能比现在更加严峻。</p>
<p>You must be driven by necessity now, not by preference, not by ideology, not merely by personal perspective, but by necessity. It is a powerful force and can be redemptive if it is discerned correctly, and if it is responded to wisely. You do not have to continue to worry about what you are going to do in life, and who you are, and what you want—this endless subjective dilemma.</p>
<p>你现在必须被必然性所驱动，不是偏好，不是意识形态，也不是仅仅个人视角，而是必然性。它是一股强大的力量，如果能够正确辨别，并明智地回应，它就能带来救赎。你不必继续担心你这辈子要做什么，你是谁，你想要什么——这无休止的主观困境。</p>
<p>The Great Waves of change will solve all of that for you. They will call you into action. They will require your greatest talents. They will require your determination and commitment. They will require you to have a sound mind and to be experiencing the source of your inner strength, the power of Knowledge within you. In this, they are wholly redemptive, for they will give purpose, meaning and direction to your life.</p>
<p>变革的巨浪将为你解决所有这些问题。它们将召唤你采取行动。它们将需要你最伟大的才能。它们将需要你的决心和承诺。它们将需要你拥有一个健全的心灵，并体验你内在力量的源泉，你内在内识的力量。在这里，它们是完全救赎性的，因为它们将赋予你的生命目的、意义和方向。</p>
<p>You were born for these times. You were born for these events. You have not come into the world simply to be a consumer, simply to feather your nest, simply to enrich yourself, simply to be safe, simply to hide out somewhere, caught up in your desires and fantasies and dilemmas.</p>
<p>你生来就是为了这些时代。你生来就是为了这些事件。你来到这个世界，并非只是为了消费，并非只是为了中饱私囊，并非只是为了致富，并非只是为了寻求安全，并非只是为了躲藏在某个地方，陷于你的欲望、幻想和困境之中。</p>
<p>Life has a much greater purpose for you. It is a gift, if you can see it. It is a blessing, if you can see it. It is exactly what you need for your life, if you can see it.</p>
<p>生命对你来说，有着更伟大的意义。它是一份礼物，只要你能看到它。它是一份祝福，只要你能看到它。它正是你生命的必需品，只要你能看到它。</p>
<p>Your unique contribution will arise in the face of great necessity. Do not deny the necessity, or you deny that which will call out of you your greatest gifts, that which will provide for you the real redemption that your life requires and that your heart desires.</p>
<p>你独特的贡献将在伟大的必要性面前显现。不要否认这种必要性，否则你就否认了那将激发你最伟大礼物的事情，那将为你提供你生命所需、你内心渴望的真正救赎的东西。</p>
<p>You were born for these times. Face them. Accept them. Recognize them. Allow them to counsel you as to what you must see and know and do. Allow them to issue forth and call forth a greater courage and a greater commitment.</p>
<p>你生来就是为了这些时代。面对它们。接受它们。认知它们。让它们指引你，告诉你必须看见什么、知道什么、做什么。让它们发出并召唤你更伟大的勇气和更伟大的承诺。</p>
<p>And if your mind wanders, if you lose your vision, or if you think you can escape into some other fantasy about life, think about food, water and energy. These things are no longer guaranteed. This will bring you back to your senses, to simple clarity, to personal responsibility and to true determination.</p>
<p>如果你思绪飘忽，如果你迷失了方向，或者如果你以为可以逃避现实，那就想想食物、水和能源。这些东西不再是可以保证的。这会带你恢复理智，回归简单的清晰，回归个人责任，回归真正的决心。</p>
<p>Look to your children, and to other children, and to the elderly, to the vulnerable members of society. You have a responsibility to them, too.</p>
<p>关注你的孩子，关注其他孩子，关注老人，关注社会上的弱势群体。你对他们也负有责任。</p>
<p>If humanity cannot unite and succeed in the face of prosperity, it must unite and succeed in the face of failure. It can and must do this. In this, failure can be a greater incentive than success.</p>
<p>如果人类无法在繁荣面前团结一致、取得成功，那么就必须团结一致、在失败面前取得成功。人类能够而且必须做到这一点。在这方面，失败比成功更能激励人心。</p>
<p>The power and presence of Knowledge is with you. It is prepared for these times. It is ready. It has always been ready. It is now time to prepare your mind and emotions, and your circumstances, and your priorities for the life you are facing now and will be facing increasingly in the future.</p>
<p>内识的力量和存在与你同在。它为这些时代做好了准备。它已经准备好了。它一直都准备好了。现在是时候为你的心灵和情感，你的境遇，以及你的优先事项，为你现在所面对的以及未来将越来越多地面对的生命做好准备了。</p>
<p>How all these things will play out, no one can tell for sure. The future is always changing in that regard. But generally what is coming is clear, and the world is giving you its signs and its indications.</p>
<p>所有这些事情最终会如何发展，无人能言。未来总是在变化。但总的来说，未来是清晰的，世界正在向你展现它的征兆和迹象。</p>
<p>You do not need to be in confusion or in deliberation regarding this. The question is: How will you respond? What will motivate you? Where will you find courage, strength and determination? How can you avoid falling into panic and self-denial? How can you keep your mind clear while everyone around you is sinking into despair and confusion and outrage?</p>
<p>你无需为此感到困惑或深思熟虑。问题是：你将如何应对？什么会激励你？你将从何处获得勇气、力量和决心？你如何避免陷入恐慌和自我否定？当你周围的人都陷入绝望、困惑和愤怒时，你如何保持心灵的清晰？</p>
<p>It will take great courage, and you must be committed to having this courage and having clarity of mind—not being swayed by fear or preference now, but by clarity based upon what you are seeing and what the world is telling you.</p>
<p>它需要伟大的勇气，你必须致力于拥有这种勇气和清晰的心灵——现在不被恐惧或偏好所左右，而是基于你所看见的和世界告诉你的清晰的心灵。</p>
<p>This will bring your life into a greater focus and a greater meaning and direction—everything you have sought before but could not find. It is a blessing of untold power. But you can only receive this blessing with your recognition and with your preparation and with a greater commitment that will take you into the future.</p>
<p>这将带你的生命进入一个更伟大的焦点、更伟大的意义和方向——所有你过去寻求却未能找到的东西。它是一个蕴含着无尽力量的祝福。但你只有凭借你的认知、你的准备以及一个将引领你走向未来的更伟大承诺，才能接收这个祝福。</p>
<p>Ultimately, you and everyone here is destined and designed to provide the gifts of Knowledge to the world, in whatever form, substance, context is necessary. Every person is designed to contribute something unique here, but very few people are aware of what this really is, for they think it is just [about] what they want.</p>
<p>最终，你和这里的每个人注定并被设计为向世界提供内识的礼物，无论以何种形式、内容和背景都是必要的。每个人都被设计在这里贡献一些独特的东西，但很少有人察觉到这究竟是什么，因为他们认为这只是他们想要的。</p>
<p>But the world will help tell you what it needs from you. It will call out of you your greater gifts. It will take you beyond personal preference and personal fear. It will reveal to you what you can and must give, and where these gifts must be given, and the people with whom you will associate who will assist you in this great effort.</p>
<p>但世界将帮助你告诉你它需要你什么。它将从你身上唤起你更伟大的礼物。它将带你超越个人偏好和个人恐惧。它将向你揭示你能够和必须给予什么，这些礼物必须给予到哪里，以及你将与之交往、在这个伟大努力中协助你的人们。</p>
<p>You may be confused, but Knowledge is certain. The world is heading in its direction. You cannot change that now. You may be able to mitigate the impacts of humanity’s present and future actions, but what you are facing is coming with great certainty.</p>
<p>你或许感到困惑，但内识是确定无疑的。世界正朝着它的方向前进。你现在无法改变这一点。你或许能够减轻人类现在和未来行动的影响，但你所面临的一切却必然会到来。</p>
<p>When you realize you cannot avoid reality, then you must determine [how] you will be successful, and [how] you will be of great benefit to others within this reality. And this is where your strength will emerge.</p>
<p>当你意识到你无法逃避现实时，你必须确定你将如何成功，以及你将如何在这个现实中为他人带来伟大的益处。而这正是你的力量显现的地方。</p>
