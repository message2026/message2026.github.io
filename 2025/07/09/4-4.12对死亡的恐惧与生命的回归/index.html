<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on January 21, 2008 in Boulder, Colorado<br>2008 年 1 月 21 日，在科罗拉多州博尔德(Boulder, Colorado)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fear of death is a very pervasive fear. It gives rise to anxiety about the future, about the prospect for future loss. It gives rise to an inordinate emphasis on personal safety and security. It conditions people’s perception, how they view their life and their future and the whole world. It is the great price of consciousness. And with the fear of death is the loss of peace and equanimity.</p>
<p>对死亡的恐惧是一种非常普遍的恐惧。它引发对未来的焦虑，对未来可能失去的担忧。它导致人们过度强调个人安全。它影响着人们的感知，影响着他们如何看待他们的生命、未来以及整个世界。它是意识的巨大代价。而对死亡的恐惧，也意味着和平与宁静的丧失。</p>
<p>This is the great price of being conscious of one’s future and to be aware of the process of life and death. The animals certainly have instinctual cautions, and they will take evasive action in the face of immediate threat. But they are not concerned about their future demise or of all the myriad possibilities of what could happen to them.</p>
<p>这是意识到自身未来并察觉生死过程的巨大代价。动物当然有本能的谨慎，面对迫在眉睫的威胁时，它们会采取规避行动。但它们并不担心未来的死亡，也不担心可能发生的种种可能性。</p>
<p>This is the burden of the awareness of life and death. It is the price one pays for having a greater consciousness in a world of change. It is the difficulty an eternal being must face in living in a temporary reality.</p>
<p>这是对生死觉知的负担。它是在变化的世界中拥有更伟大意识的代价。它是永恒生命在短暂的现实中生存时必须面对的困境。</p>
<p>A great deal of what religion emphasizes has to deal with the reality of death, the meaning of one’s afterlife and how one can resolve this fundamental conflict, this fundamental paradox between the reality of one’s inner spiritual life and one’s mortality in the world.</p>
<p>宗教所强调的很多内容都与死亡的现实、来世的意义以及如何解决这种根本冲突、这种人的内在精神生命现实与人在世间的必死性之间的根本矛盾有关。</p>
<p>This has been the focal point for religion and philosophy, and for social sciences and for human thinking and human preoccupation. It has been the source of tremendous suffering. It is what has kept people from living in the moment, and being present to the moment, and finding the deeper voice that God has placed within them to guide them and to protect them and to lead them to their greater accomplishments in life.</p>
<p>这一直是宗教和哲学、社会科学以及人类思维和人类关注的焦点。它一直是巨大苦难的根源。它阻止人们活在当下，无法活在当下，无法找到上帝置于他们内在的更深层次的声音，来指引他们、保护他们、引领他们走向生命中更伟大的成就。</p>
<p>The part of you that has been born in the world and conditioned by the world and educated by the world is constantly afraid of death, and not only loss of your physical vehicle, your physical body, but the loss of everything you value—the loss of your wealth, the loss of your privileges, the loss of your power, the loss of your self-determination, the loss of your relationships, the loss of your home, the loss of your possessions. So predominating this is that it conditions and determines how people will live, how they will respond to the world and what they will do and not do to prepare for the future.</p>
<p>你生于世界、受世界熏陶、受世界教育的部分，始终害怕死亡，害怕的不仅是失去你的物质载体，你的物质身体，还有失去你珍视的一切——失去你的财富，失去你的特权，失去你的权力，失去你的自决权，失去你的关系，失去你的家园，失去你的财产。这些如此主导，以至于它制约并决定了人们将如何生活，他们将如何回应世界，以及他们将做什么和不做什么来为未来进行准备。</p>
<p>The emphasis on death is all around you—in your media, in the reporting of terrible events all over the world, in the wealthy people’s preoccupation with their health and their physical survival, and with the great dangers that the ever-growing numbers of poor people in the world must face regarding their own fundamental lack of security and provision of vital resources.</p>
<p>对死亡的强调无处不在——在你们的媒体中，在对世界各地可怕事件的报道中，在富人对他们的健康和身体生存的关注中，在世界上越来越多的穷人因缺乏基本安全感和重要资源供应而必须面对的巨大危险中。</p>
<p>It is true to say that people are more focused on death than on life. They are already more dead than they are alive. That is why their worldly mind is constantly driven by having to have more and more and more—even beyond any reasonable acquisition or provision—more and more, trying to quell the anxiety, the insecurity that is so fundamental to living in a temporary reality. People are so afraid to die because regardless of their religious beliefs and reassurances, they think they are losing everything. They think they are gambling everything as if there either is nothing on the other side or it will be so disappointing, so insignificant compared to what they have now.</p>
<p>确实，人们更关注死亡而非生命。他们已经比活着更像死亡了。正因如此，他们的世俗之心不断被想要拥有更多、更多、更多——甚至超越任何合理的获取或供给——的欲望所驱使，试图平息焦虑和不安全感，而这些对于生活在短暂的现实中至关重要。人们如此害怕死亡，因为无论他们的宗教信仰和安慰如何，他们都认为他们正在失去一切。他们认为他们正在孤注一掷，仿佛另一边要么一无所有，要么与现在拥有的相比，那将是无比令人失望、无比微不足道的。</p>
<p>The reality of death is so with people, even on an unconscious level, that they really have difficulty experiencing life. They are dying a thousand and ten thousand times over through their concerns and anxieties, through their apprehension, through their terror, through their denial, through their avoidance, through their compulsive consumption. They are dying over and over again, as if life is nothing more than simply trying to mitigate the inevitable death.</p>
<p>死亡的现实如此深刻地存在于人们身上，即使在潜意识层面，他们也难以真正体验生命。他们因为担忧、焦虑、恐惧、否认、逃避、以及强迫性消费而死上千次、万次。他们一次又一次地死去，仿佛生命只不过是试图减轻死亡的必然性。</p>
<p>But you see, you were sent into the world for a greater purpose, and this greater purpose is what illuminates your life, what gives it value and meaning, purpose and direction. Those who sent you here know that this is like a tour of duty; it is temporary. And it is important that life in the physical is temporary because it is fundamentally difficult.</p>
<p>但你看，你被派到这个世界是为了一个更伟大的目的，正是这个更伟大的目的照亮了你的生命，赋予了它价值和意义、目的和方向。那些派你来到这里的人知道，它就像一次任务之旅；它是暂时的。重要的是，物质生命是暂时的，因为它从根本上来说是困难的。</p>
<p>Even if you acquire so much wealth that you never see the evidence of human suffering and death, which would be quite an absurd existence, even if you condition your mind in thinking in such a way that the anxiety about death and loss has a very minimal impact upon you, you are still living in a very compromised environment—an environment of constant change, constant adaptation, constant problem solving, constant renegotiating what you must do, where you must go, how to be with people, how to be with situations, how to be with yourself.</p>
<p>即便你获得了如此多的财富，以至于你永远不会看到人类苦难和死亡的证据，这将是一种相当荒谬的存在，即便你调节你的心灵，使对死亡和失去的焦虑对你的影响非常小，你仍然生活在一个非常妥协的环境中——一个不断变化、不断适应、不断解决问题、不断重新协商你必须做什么、你必须去哪里、如何与人相处、如何与境遇相处、如何与你自己相处的环境。</p>
<p>To the soul, it is like a tour of duty. It is like a mission. It is like going from a wonderful place to a difficult place to make a contribution. That is what being in the world is to your soul. Because you live in your mind, which has been born in the world and conditioned by the world and identified with the world, the specter of change, the specter of loss, all the realities of life that can become so amplified here, now completely dominate you. And sadness and loss and grief are inevitable here.</p>
<p>对灵魂而言，它就像一次值班之旅。它就像一项使命。它就像从一个美妙的地方来到一个艰难的地方，去做出贡献。这就是身处世间对你的灵魂的意义。因为你活在你的心灵中，而你的心灵诞生于世界，受世事所制约，并认同于世事，所以改变的幽灵、失落的幽灵，以及所有在此得以放大的生命现实，如今完全主宰了你。悲伤、失落和悲痛在此不可避免。</p>
<p>If you really try to be without fear, how will you be able to love anything—any person, any place, nature, any possession, any experience? They are all temporary, you see. At some point you will not have them anymore, at least not here. And regarding your relationships, certainly you will meet them again but under very different circumstances, and you do not know what they are.</p>
<p>如果你真的试图不去恐惧，你又怎么可能爱任何事物——任何人、任何地点、任何自然、任何财产、任何体验？你看，它们都是暂时的。总有一天，你会失去它们，至少不会在这里。至于你的关系，你当然会再次遇到它们，但处境截然不同，而你却不知道它们究竟是什么。</p>
<p>What returns you to life is Knowledge within you, the greater Mind that the Creator has given you and the purpose for which you have come, which is stored safely in Knowledge within you, and which will arise gradually as you begin to move in a true direction in your life.</p>
<p>让你重获生命的是你内在的内识，是造物主赋予你的更伟大心灵以及你来此的目的，它安全地储存在你内在的内识中，当你开始朝着你生命的真正方向前进时，它将逐渐浮现。</p>
<p>It is not as if the awareness of death or the anxiety of death disappears entirely here. It is that they are overshadowed by something far more significant, far more important. For without this greater purpose, without this greater Intelligence within you, life then becomes a struggle for survival, a desperate attempt to secure and maintain temporary pleasures, a quest for power, a struggle, a competition.</p>
<p>并非死亡的觉知或死亡的焦虑在此完全消失。而是它们被一种远为重要、远为深远的内识所遮蔽。因为如果没有这个更伟大的目的，如果没有你内在的这个更伟大的智能，生命就会变成一场生存的挣扎，一场对短暂快乐的绝望尝试，一场对权力的追求，一场斗争，一场竞争。</p>
<p>However you look at it, it is without hope. It is fundamentally miserable. It is fundamentally insecure. It is fundamentally full of anxiety. You can pretend and try to keep all of these things at bay, believing and indulging in what you want and what you have and the prospect of having more and so forth. But within yourself, you are running scared. You are running wild, trying to keep one step ahead of the truth and the reality within yourself.</p>
<p>无论你怎么看，它都毫无希望。它从根本上来说是悲惨的。它从根本上来说是不安全的。它从根本上来说是充满焦虑的。你可以假装，试图避开所有这些，相信并沉溺于你想要的、你拥有的以及拥有更多等等的前景。但在你自己的内心，你却在恐惧中奔跑。你正在疯狂奔跑，试图领先你自己内心的真理与现实一步。</p>
<p>That is why people cannot be still. That is why people need constant stimulation. That is why people need to be preoccupied every waking moment so they do not have to feel their condition. Unable now to be with themselves, unable now to be with anything really, they must race from thing to thing. They must be constantly engaged in conversation and must have constant stimulation.</p>
<p>这就是为什么人们无法静下心来。这就是为什么人们需要持续的刺激。这就是为什么人们需要每时每刻都全神贯注，这样他们才不必去感受他们的处境。他们现在无法与他们自己相处，无法真正地与任何事物相处，他们必须从一件事赶到另一件事。他们必须不断地参与对话，必须不断地获得刺激。</p>
<p>This is truly the sign of desperation, whether a person is rich or whether they are poor. They are desperately running away from themselves. And because of this, they are running away from the one thing that could save them and serve them and strengthen them and give them the great antidote to fear.</p>
<p>这确实是绝望的标志，无论一个人是富人还是穷人。他们拼命地逃避他们自己。正因如此，他们逃避了唯一能够拯救他们、服务他们、赋予他们力量、给予他们战胜恐惧的良药。</p>
<p>Knowledge within you, the deeper Mind within you that represents your true and permanent reality, it is not afraid. It has, however, one concern and that is that you will not follow it, that you will not pay attention to it, that you will not take the steps to becoming aware of it, regaining your relationship with it. Its one concern is that it cannot reach you.</p>
<p>你内在的内识，你内在更深层次的心灵，代表着你真实而持久的现实，它并不害怕。然而，它有一个顾虑，那就是你不会追随它，你不会关注它，你不会迈出察觉它的步伐，重新获得你与它的关系。它唯一的顾虑是，它无法触及你。</p>
<p>This concern is different from fear. It is really about wasting a tremendous opportunity in life. If you do not find and follow Knowledge within yourself in this life, you go home to your Spiritual Family with your gifts ungiven, with your presents unopened, and you return to your learning group, who has been assigned to you, and you realize, “Oh, my God. I didn’t do it. I didn’t give what I wanted to give. I didn’t do what I wanted to do. I forgot. I want to go back. When can I go back?”</p>
<p>这种担忧不同于恐惧。它实际上是在浪费生命中一个绝佳的机会。如果你此生没有找到并遵循你内在的内识，你带着未给予的礼物、未打开的礼物回到你的精神家庭，你回到你被指派的学习小组，你意识到：“哦，我的上帝。我没有做到。我没有给予我想给予的礼物。我没有做我想做的事。我忘记了。我想要回去。我什么时候才能回去？”</p>
<p>Then, well, you have to wait for the right time, for the right opportunity, for the right engagements. And you may not even be assigned to this world. You may have to go to some other world. You may have to wait a long time.</p>
<p>那么，你必须等待正确的时间，正确的机会，正确的参与。你甚至可能不会被分配到这个世界。你可能不得不去另一个世界。你可能要等待很长的时间。</p>
<p>So anxious you are to give what you want to give, to establish your reality, your permanent reality, within your awareness while you are living in a temporary reality. So important this is. You realize it. You see it. It is clear as day. You know it to be true. Free now from all the anxieties and concerns over loss and survival and acquisition and pleasure and wealth and so forth, your true purpose shines like the sun.</p>
<p>你如此渴望给予你想给予的内识，渴望在你的觉知中建立你的现实，你持久的现实，即便你活在一个暂时的现实中。这如此重要。你意识到了它。你看到了它。它清晰可见。你知道它是真实的。现在，你摆脱了所有关于失去、生存、获得、快乐、财富等等的焦虑和担忧，你真正的目的将如阳光般闪耀。</p>
<p>But here in this world at this time, the sun is hidden by many clouds. These clouds create great confusion, great anxiety, great suffering and great misapplication of your time and energy, a misunderstanding of the purpose of your relationships, wasteful expenditure of your resources.</p>
<p>但此时此刻，这个世界的太阳被乌云所遮蔽。这些乌云造成了巨大的困惑、焦虑、痛苦，并导致时间和精力的浪费，对关系目的的误解，以及资源的浪费。</p>
<p>God has given you an antidote to fear. It is an antidote to everything that preoccupies you and keeps you frightened, keeps you desperate, keeps you running, keeps you trying to escape, keeps you addicted and a slave to other forces. But to find it, you must return to yourself. You must stop your desperate attempts. You must slow yourself down. You must create an opening in your life and must continue to do this to re-establish over time your fundamental relationship with Knowledge, which is your fundamental relationship with yourself and through this, your relationship with God.</p>
<p>上帝赋予了你一剂恐惧解药。它是一剂解药，可以解除所有困扰你、让你恐惧、让你绝望、让你奔跑、让你试图逃离、让你沉迷并成为其他力量的奴隶的一切。但要找到它，你必须回归你自己。你必须停止你绝望的尝试。你必须放慢脚步。你必须在你的生命中创造一个开口，必须持续这样做，以便随着时间的推移重建你与内识的根本关系，这是你与你自己的根本关系，并由此，你与上帝的关系。</p>
<p>You cannot come to God as a desperate, frantic person overwhelmed with fear and anxiety or rage, indignation and prejudice. You will go to some other god with these attitudes, with these conditions. You cannot go to God like this because you will not be able to experience the Presence of God in your life, which will provide you all the reassurance you need and the reminder that you are only here temporarily and that your life in the world, regardless of your circumstances, is really a tremendous sacrifice to be here. It cannot compare with your Ancient Home.</p>
<p>你无法以一个绝望、疯狂、被恐惧、焦虑或愤怒、愤慨和偏见淹没的人的身份来到上帝面前。你会带着这些态度，带着这些状态，去投奔某个其他的上帝。你无法这样来到上帝面前，因为你将无法体验上帝在你生命中的存在，这将提供你所需的所有保证，并提醒你只是暂时在此，你在此世上的生命，无论你的境遇如何，都是一种极大的牺牲。它无法与你的古老家园相比。</p>
<p>But when you experience the Presence of God, when you experience the reality of Knowledge within yourself, then you have these reminders. You have these experiences. You have this sense that “Well, my life is really about something else, and I must find out what that is, and I must follow what is given me to follow to find out what that is, over time.” For a simple definition will not answer it. An explanation will not answer it. A nametag will not answer it. Declaring yourself to be this or to be that will not answer it. This is the return to life. This is coming back to what is really life within you and really life within the world.</p>
<p>但是当你体验上帝的存在，当你体验你内在内识的现实时，你就会拥有这些提醒。你会拥有这些体验。你会有这种感觉：“嗯，我的生命实际上是关于某种别的东西，我必须发现那是什么，我必须遵循被赋予我去遵循的内识，随着时间的推移，去发现内识是什么。”因为一个简单的定义无法回答它。一个解释无法回答它。一个名字标签无法回答它。宣称你自己是这个或那个也无法回答它。这就是生命的回归。这就是回归你内在的真正生命，回归世界中的实际生命。</p>
<p>Everything in the world is here playing its part, but human beings are having a real difficult time in playing their parts. Aware of their death, aware of their temporary existence and all of the mental and physical illness that arises out of this; all of the compulsion, all of the rage, all of the indignation have given rise to a world where humanity is not playing its part, where individuals are not playing their part, where you are not yet playing your part. It is like a shift from living in a state of darkness and self-avoidance to living in a state of purpose and self-engagement. It creates a total revolution, as if you have gone 360 degrees. You have completely shifted.</p>
<p>世间万物都在扮演着各自的角色，但人类在扮演他们的角色时却异常艰难。察觉到他们的死亡，察觉到他们的短暂存在，以及由此引发的所有身心疾病；所有的冲动、所有的愤怒、所有的愤慨，造就了这样一个世界：人类没有扮演它的角色，个体没有扮演他们的角色，你也还没有扮演好你的角色。它就像是从生活在黑暗和自我回避的状态，转变为生活在目的明确和自我参与的状态。它带来了一场彻底的革命，仿佛你经历了360度的转变。你彻底改变了。</p>
<p>During this shift, things begin to change for you—your values, your priorities, what you seek in your relationships, the qualities you want to experience within yourself. And as you [under]take this shift, as you go through this transition, you see, you begin to regain a sense of power and purpose and competence.</p>
<p>在这个转变过程中，你的一切都开始改变——你的价值观、你的优先事项、你在关系中的追求，以及你渴望在你自己中体验到的品质。当你接受这个转变，当你经历这个转变，你会看到，你开始重新获得力量、目的与能力。</p>
<p>The fear of this and all that is associated with it is still there, but it is becoming weaker, not so predominating now. You become less concerned about what is happening in the world, which is ultimately just a concern about one’s survival and the loss of one’s privileges and entitlements and the loss of the things that one loves and values. There is a shift away from this overarching anxiety to a sense of purpose: “Regardless of what happens, I’m here to do certain things, and I must find my way to do those things. I must follow the voice that tells me where to go and what to do and what not to do. And I must watch the signs, and I must feel the impulses within myself and learn to distinguish them from my own compulsions or ideas.”</p>
<p>对此及其相关事物的恐惧依然存在，但正在减弱，不再那么主导。你不再那么关心世事，而这最终只是对生存的担忧，对失去特权和权益的担忧，以及对失去所爱所珍视之物的担忧。这种压倒性的焦虑正在转变为一种目的感：“无论发生什么，我来到这个世界上是为了做某些事情，我必须找到自己的方式去做这些事情。我必须听从那个告诉我该去哪里、该做什么、不该做什么的声音。我必须观察这些迹象，我必须感受自己内心的冲动，并学会将它们与我自己的冲动或想法区分开来。”</p>
<p>People have a very incorrect notion of what redemption is. They think redemption is behaving well and then going to have a reward in Heaven. This is ridiculous. You are not ready for Heaven. Even if your behavior is very commendable, you are still full of rage and anxiety and condemnation and judgment and conflict. You still cannot even be with yourself, so how are you going to be with God? You cannot be still for a moment. How are you going to enter a realm of eternal stillness? You cannot really give yourself to another very effectively. How are you going to give yourself to all of Creation?</p>
<p>人们对救赎有着非常错误的理解。他们认为救赎就是行为良好，然后在天堂获得奖赏。这是荒谬的。你还没有为天堂做好准备。即便你的行为非常值得称赞，你依然充满愤怒、焦虑、谴责、评判和冲突。你甚至无法与你自己相处，那么你如何与上帝相处？你一刻也静不下来。你如何进入一个永恒静止的境界？你无法真正有效地将你自己交给另一个人。你如何将你自己交给所有创造？</p>
<p>People think that Heaven is like a reward for being a good boy or a good girl or following the religious edicts or believing what you are told to believe. You cannot return to your Ancient Home if that is your emphasis. What are you going to do, wait at the gates forever?</p>
<p>人们认为天堂就像是对好男孩或好女孩、遵守宗教戒律或相信教义的奖励。如果你强调这一点，你就无法回到你的古老家园。你打算怎么做？永远在门口等待吗？</p>
<p>You have to come into the world to fulfill a purpose. It is that purpose that redeems you. It is that service that restores to you the memory and the sense of your Ancient Home. It is this purpose and this awareness that dispels and weakens the weight of the world on you.</p>
<p>你必须来到这个世界去履行一个目的。正是这个目的救赎了你。正是这个服务重建了你对你古老家园的记忆与感知。正是这个目的和这个觉知驱散并削弱了世界对你造成的重负。</p>
<p>Then if you are a success, death is looked at very differently. It is still an anxiety-provoking event, certainly. “Oh, my God what will happen? Oh, my God, I’m not going to be here any more. Oh, my God, what will remain? What will happen? What will be next?” But in your heart there is a sense of completion and relief. “It is ok. I’m ready to move on. I have done what I came here to do to the best of my ability. I’m not sure what I did, but I did something and it feels right and I think I’m ready to go on to the next thing.”</p>
<p>如果你成功了，人们对死亡的看法就会截然不同。当然，它仍然是一件令人焦虑的事情。“哦，我的上帝，会发生什么？哦，我的上帝，我再也不在这里了。哦，我的上帝，还会剩下什么？会发生什么？接下来会发生什么？”但你的内心会有一种圆满和解脱的感觉。“没关系。我准备好继续前进了。我已经尽我所能完成了我来这里要做的事情。我不确定我做了什么，但我做了一些事情，感觉是对的，我想我已经准备好继续下一件事了。”</p>
<p>It is a natural progression, you see. But if your work has [not been done] here, that produces another kind of anxiety and represents a deeper need within you. It does make a difference, you see, whether you achieve your goals here or not. It makes a fundamental difference in the quality and the meaning of your life and how you will view death at the end. Will death then be a natural and anticipated transition? Or will it carry with it a great sense of failure and discouragement?</p>
<p>你看，它是一个自然的进程。但如果你的工作在这里没有完成，就会产生另一种焦虑，代表你内心一种更深层次的需求。你看，你能否在这里实现你的目标，确实会有所不同。它会对你生命的质量和意义，以及你最终如何看待死亡，产生根本性的影响。那么，死亡会是一个自然而然、意料之中的过渡吗？还是它会伴随着巨大的失败感和沮丧？</p>
<p>The return to life is the return to Knowledge and the return to the purpose that has brought you into the world. This happens gradually through many stages because to go through such a great transition from being a person who is a product of the world to being a person who has been sent into the world by God, that is not a cosmetic makeover of oneself. You do not rearrange your wardrobe, simply.</p>
<p>回归生命，就是回归内识，回归将你带到这个世界的目的。这需要通过多个阶段逐渐实现，因为要经历如此伟大的转变：从一个世界的产物，到一个被上帝派到这个世界的人，这并非是对自身的一次美容改造。你并非简单地重新整理你的衣橱。</p>
<p>You have to go through a great transition in yourself. You have to bring to bear the power of Knowledge in your relationships, in your decisions, in your work, regarding your health, where you are, what you are doing, who you are with, everything. The application goes everywhere. You cannot simply be a foolish person and have a few subtle thoughts or great ideas.</p>
<p>你必须经历你自己内在的一次伟大转变。你必须将内识的力量运用到你的关系中，你的决定中，你的工作中，你的健康中，你身在何处，你正在做什么，你和谁在一起，所有的一切。内识的应用无处不在。你不能只是做一个愚蠢的人，拥有一些微妙的思想或伟大的想法。</p>
<p>For Knowledge brings with it responsibility and a sense of commitment. Here the real anxiety is whether you can accomplish what you came to accomplish, for if you do not, you will be disappointed. You will go Home to your Spiritual Family, and you will be disappointed. You will feel that your journey in the world was unsuccessful, that you were seduced and overwhelmed and persuaded and lost. At that point, you will see clearly what happened to you and the great lost opportunity that your life was.</p>
<p>因为内识带来了责任感和一种承诺感。在这里，真正的焦虑在于你能否完成你来此要完成的事情，因为如果你做不到，你将会失望。你将回归你的精神家庭，你将失望。你将感到你在世界上的旅程是失败的，你被诱惑、被淹没、被说服、被迷失。在那一刻，你将清晰地看到你身上发生了什么，以及你的生命失去了多么伟大的机会。</p>
<p>Now it is very important to realize that your intellect cannot manufacture your purpose. It cannot even comprehend your purpose in its entirety. It can only see the evidence of purpose. It can only see the signs. You cannot sit down and figure this out. If you try to create an explanation or a philosophy, you are still up at the surface. You have not gone deep enough. You are trying to create your reality instead of finding the reality that created you, that is directing you, and that is taking you somewhere, as it has a plan for you.</p>
<p>现在，非常重要的是要意识到，你的智力无法产生你的目的。它甚至无法完全领会你的目的。它只能看到目的的证据。它只能看到迹象。你无法坐下来弄清楚这一点。如果你试图创造一种解释或一种哲学，那么你仍然停留在表面。你还没有深入到足够深的层面。你试图创造你的现实，而不是去寻找那个创造了你、指引着你、带你去往某个地方的现实，因为它为你制定了一个计划。</p>
<p>Some people think this leads to a kind of passivity where they just sit around and God tells them what to do. But this is not correct at all. You have to be the captain of your ship. God will tell you where to sail and what your cargo is, but you have to manage your mind. You have to manage your behavior. You have to manage your affairs. You have to make important decisions. You have to rise to the occasion of your life. You have to regain your strength, your composure and your focus.</p>
<p>有些人认为这会导致一种被动，他们只是坐在那里，听上帝的指挥。但这完全不正确。你必须成为你这艘船的船长。上帝会告诉你航行的方向和货物，但你必须掌控你的心灵。你必须掌控你的行为。你必须管理你的事务。你必须做出重要的决定。你必须迎接生命的挑战。你必须重新获得你的实力、你的镇定和你的专注。</p>
<p>People think you just be like a little child, and God just moves your life around. That is just a desire to be irresponsible. “I’ll give it all to God to do it. I’ll just hang out somewhere.” There is no welfare here. There is no spiritual welfare. You do not simply go and collect every week your paycheck from Heaven. You were sent here to achieve certain things with certain people. You cannot be fooling around. You cannot drop the ball and go sit down somewhere for the rest of your life. You cannot be idiotic.</p>
<p>人们认为你就像一个小孩子，任由上帝摆布你的人生。这只是一种不负责任的欲望。“我把一切都交给上帝去做。我随便找个地方待着就好。”这里没有福利。没有精神上的福利。你不是简单地每周去天堂领取薪水。你被派到这里是为了和特定的人一起完成特定的事。你不能混日子。你不能把事情搞砸，然后找个地方安度余生。你不能做傻事。</p>
<p>You have to get serious about what you are doing, where your energy is going, where you are losing energy, the relationships that are taking energy away from you even right now, the journeys you are taking that lead nowhere, the misuse of your time, the misuse of your resources, the misuse and application of your love and attention.</p>
<p>你必须认真对待你正在做的事情，你的能量都花在了哪里，你在哪里损失了能量，那些甚至现在就从你身上吸取能量的关系，你正在进行的毫无结果的旅程，你的时间被错误使用，你的资源被错误使用，你的爱和注意力被错误使用与应用。</p>
<p>People love all kinds of things that have nothing to do with who they are and why they are here. This is not preparing them for the Great Waves of change that are coming in the future. People love knick-knacks. They love things that are so inconsequential, and then they feel inconsequential. They devote themselves to things that have no inherent meaning; therefore, they feel they have no inherent meaning.</p>
<p>人们喜爱各种与他们的身份和身处此地无关的事物。这并不能让他们为未来即将到来的巨变做好准备。人们喜爱小玩意儿。他们喜爱那些如此无关紧要的事物，然后他们感到无关紧要。他们把他们自己奉献给那些没有内在意义的事物；因此，人们感到他们没有内在的意义。</p>
<p>In time, the experience of Knowledge and the experience of resonance with others and shared purpose with others will be the things that you value the most. Everything else will fall in line after that. And nothing else will be really that important, unless it represents something you are here specifically to do for the well-being of the world and the well-being of humanity, or the well-being of whoever you are assigned to serve or whatever you are here to do, which is waiting for you to discover.</p>
<p>假以时日，内识的体验，与他人共鸣的体验以及与他人共同的目的，将成为你最珍视的事情。此后，其他一切都会水到渠成。没有其他任何事情会真正那么重要，除非它代表着你在此特别要做的事情，为了世界的福祉和人类的福祉，或者为了你被指派去服务的任何人的福祉，或者为了你在此要做的事情，而这正在等待你去发现。</p>
<p>What was meaningful before is not so meaningful now. What was significant before is not so significant now, for that significance has been given to something greater and more fundamental and more authentic and genuine within you.</p>
<p>以前有意义的事物，现在不那么有意义了。以前重要的事物，现在不那么重要了，因为那个意义已经被赋予了你内在一种更伟大、更根本、更真实、更真诚的内识。</p>
<p>God saves you while you are here by giving you something important to do. It has already been given to you. People pray to God for all kinds of things, but they are neglecting the real endowment from God, the real gift from God, which is something beyond their ideas and their beliefs, something fundamental to their nature and reality of their Being.</p>
<p>当你身处此地时，上帝通过赋予你一些重要的事情去做来拯救你。它已经被赋予了你。人们向上帝祈祷各种各样的事情，但他们却忽视了来自上帝的真正恩赐，来自上帝的真正礼物，它是超越他们的想法和信仰的内识，是对他们的自然与他们存在的现实至关重要的内识。</p>
<p>Everyone who comes into the world gets lost in the world. Your first job is to find your way back, to get out of the state of being lost, being groundless, like a rudderless ship that is simply being blown all over the place. You have to get your bearings. You have to come back and listen to your deeper experience.</p>
<p>每个来到这个世界上的人都会迷失在这个世界上。你的首要任务就是找到回去的路，摆脱迷失、无根基的状态，就像一艘没有舵的船，被吹得四处飘荡。你必须找到你的方向。你必须回来，倾听你内心更深层次的体验。</p>
<p>That is why in taking the Steps to Knowledge, one of the first things you learn is to become still and observant so you can begin to experience your deeper experience. Otherwise, it is all overlaid with your frantic thinking and your frantic behavior, your loves, your passions, your hobbies, your obsessions, your conflicts, your grievances, your campaigns. There is no time to experience the deeper current of your life here.</p>
<p>正因如此，开展内识进阶的过程中，你首先要学习的事情之一就是保持静心和观察，这样你才能开始经历你更深层次的体验。否则，你的体验就会被你疯狂的思维、疯狂的行为、你的爱、你的激情、你的爱好、你的执念、你的冲突、你的不满、你的活动所覆盖。你没有时间去体验你生命中更深层次的潮流。</p>
<p>The New Message from God has provided a way to regain your relationship with your ancient Knowledge, and with it the purpose that has brought you here, and the direction that you really need to follow. For the promise of redemption would mean nothing if the means for its accomplishment were not provided. And they have been provided. They have been provided through religions through the centuries too, but people do not seem to understand the deeper meaning here.</p>
<p>来自上帝的新讯息提供了一种方式，让你重新获得与你古老内识的关系，并由此找到引领你来到此地的目的，以及你真正需要遵循的方向。因为如果没有提供实现救赎的途径，救赎的承诺将毫无意义。而这些途径已经被提供。这些途径也通过几个世纪以来的宗教被提供，但人们似乎并未理解这里更深层次的含义。</p>
<p>Religion has become a kind of consolation, kind of a shelter. It is not seen as a requirement. It is not seen as a responsibility. It is not taken seriously by many people. It is just part of what they consume in the world. So they use it for consolation, for reassurance, but they do not see that it really carries with it a greater responsibility. And here the responsibility is to Knowledge fundamentally, not to laws and edicts and rules that do not represent Knowledge.</p>
<p>宗教已经成为一种慰藉，一种庇护所。它不被视为一种要求。它不被视为一种责任。它不被很多人认真对待。它只是他们在世界上消费的一部分。因此他们用它来寻求慰藉，寻求安慰，但他们没有看到它真正承载着一种更伟大的责任。而在这里，这种责任从根本上是对内识的，而非对那些并不代表内识的法律、法令和规则的。</p>
<p>People try to please God. They pray to God. They worship God. They fall down on their knees. They flagellate themselves. And they think that this appeases a judgmental, angry God, or this pleases a God that needs to be pleased, a God that needs to be worshiped. This is the God that they have invented.</p>
<p>人们试图取悦上帝。他们向上帝祈祷。他们敬拜上帝。他们跪倒在地。他们鞭笞他们自己。他们认为这样可以安抚那位充满审判和愤怒的上帝，或者取悦那位需要被取悦、需要被崇拜的上帝。这就是他们虚构出来的上帝。</p>
<p>The real God is acknowledged when you begin to respond to what God has put within you, and when you carry out what God has given for you to carry out in this life. That is the real meaning of religion. That is real spirituality. That is how you become close to God. That is how you please God. All this clanging and banging and worshipping—if that regenerates the memory of God and the sense of responsibility to God, then it is very good. But for many people, it is just a lot of noise and moving around.</p>
<p>当你开始回应上帝赋予你内在的内识时，当你践行上帝赋予你今生的使命时，你便会承认真正的上帝。这才是宗教的真正意义。这才是真正的精神性。这才是你接近上帝的方式。这才是你取悦上帝的方式。所有这些叮叮当当、撞击声和崇拜——如果这能重新唤起人们对上帝的记忆，并激发对上帝的责任感，那就非常好。但对许多人来说，它只不过是喧闹和四处奔波罢了。</p>
<p>Your fundamental engagement with God is by returning to Knowledge; by finding your way back from being in a lost state in the world; by learning to be still and observant; by learning to yield, to be humble; by learning to set aside, even for a few moments, your ambitions, your goals, your driving needs, your obligations—to listen more deeply.</p>
<p>你与上帝的根本接触是通过回归内识；通过从世界上的迷失状态中找到你回归的道路；通过学习保持静止与观察；通过学习屈服、保持谦逊；通过学习放下，哪怕只是片刻，你的野心、你的目标、你的驱动需求、你的义务——去更深入地聆听。</p>
<p>God does not need worship, but God does need for you to carry out what you came here to do, and to learn how to do this over time; and to not invent the journey for yourself; and to not pretend that you understand when you do not understand; and not to be irresponsible or passive but to undergo this preparation, this return to your Source and your strength, your purpose and your direction. This is the return to life.</p>
<p>上帝不需要崇拜，但上帝需要你去完成你来此要做的事，并随着时间的推移学习如何去做；不要为你自己发明旅程；不要在你不理解的时候假装你理解；不要不负责任或被动，而是要经历这种准备，回归你的本源、你的实力、你的目的和你的方向。这就是生命的回归。</p>
<p>If you cannot return to life here in this world, you have not advanced; you have not progressed. You could go home to your Spiritual Family, but you will want to come back. You will see the need. It will be evident to you. You will not be deluded by the world. You will not be consumed by the world. You will not be terrified by the world. You will just see what has to happen, and you will want to get back in the game, you see. You want to get back to do what you came here to do, to re-experience your Ancient Home while you are in the world, to stay close to the truth that lives within you, the greater reality of Knowledge.</p>
<p>如果你不能在这个世界上回归生命，你就没有进步；你没有进展。你可以回家，回到你的精神家庭，但你将想要回来。你将看到这种需求。它将对你显而易见。你将不会被世界欺骗。你将不会被世界吞噬。你将不会被世界所吓倒。你将只是看到必须发生什么，你将想要回到游戏中，你看。你想要回去做你来这里要做的事情，当你身处世界时重新体验你的古老家园，贴近活在你内在的真理，内识的更伟大现实。</p>
<p>The presence of Knowledge lives within you. It is behind the stillness that you experience when you finally calm down. It is ten paces back from the darkness that lives within your mind, the darkness that is just emptiness beneath the level of your frantic thinking and your firm beliefs. Knowledge is just there, a powerful Presence, a Presence that is not corrupted by the world, that is not fooled by the world, that is not afraid of the world, a Presence that knows who it is, why it is here, that will focus on setting a direction and fulfilling certain needs.</p>
<p>内识的存在活在你的内在。它存在于你最终冷静下来时所体验到的静止背后。它距离你心灵内蕴的黑暗只有十步之遥，这个黑暗只是你狂乱思维和坚定信念之下的空虚。内识就在那里，一个强大的存在，一个不被世界腐蚀、不被世界愚弄、不惧怕世界的存在，一个知道它是谁、它为何在此、它将专注于设定方向并满足特定需求的存在。</p>
<p>You live life at two levels, the life at which you think and the life at which you know. It is to return to the life that you know that represents redemption, and the return to God, and to wholeness and to integrity within yourself. If you can move in this direction, then death, well, it is just a transition. It will still make you nervous. You might still avoid it, but it does not carry such a weight now. It is not governing your life. It is not overwhelming you at every moment. It is not like a dark cloud that hangs over you in everything that you do.</p>
<p>你的生命生活在两个层面：你思考的层面，以及你知道的层面。回归你所知道的、代表救赎的层面，回归上帝，回归你内在的完整与正直。如果你能朝着这个方向前进，那么死亡，好吧，它只不过是一个过渡。它仍然会让你紧张。你或许仍然会回避它，但它现在不再那么沉重。它不再主宰你的生命。它不再时时刻刻压倒你。它不再像一片乌云，笼罩着你所做的一切。</p>
<p>In the world, people are depressed because they are not connected to Knowledge. They have seen the shallowness and the temporary nature of human acquisition and human success, but they have nothing to take its place, and so they feel empty. They feel the lack of real direction in their lives. They are empty.</p>
<p>在这个世界上，人们因为没有与内识连接而感到沮丧。他们看到了人类获取和人类成功的肤浅和短暂性，但他们没有任何事情可以取代它，所以他们感到空虚。他们感到生命中缺乏真正的方向。他们是空的。</p>
<p>If you are fully engaged truly in your life, you just will not have time for certain kinds of personal indulgences. You will not have time to be constantly worried about yourself, worried about your happiness, worried about your thoughts, worried about all these things. There just will not be time. You will be engaged somewhere else.</p>
<p>如果你真正全身心地投入到你的生命，你就不会有时间沉溺于某些个人的放纵。你不会有时间一直担心你自己，担心你的幸福，担心你的思想，担心所有这些事情。你根本就没有时间。你会专注于别的事情。</p>
<p>God has given you something more important to do, and you are doing that, and it takes up a lot of your time and a lot of your energy, you see. You just do not have time to fall back into those old dark places. You do not have time to go into the house and be in a rut, for your life is moving. You are moving.</p>
<p>上帝赋予了你更重要的事情去做，而你正在做这件事，你看，这耗费了你大量的时间与能量。你根本没时间再回到那些阴暗的地方。你也没时间待在家里，陷入千篇一律的困境，因为你的生命正在前进。你正在前进。</p>
<p>So whatever circumstance you are in, ask within yourself, “How can I find Knowledge within myself? What do I need to do now to find Knowledge within myself? How can I return to the real certainty that lives within me, certainty born of God? What is it I need to do in my life right now that will free me to do this, to find out these things?” Ask yourself, “Where am I losing energy to other people or to other activities?” Ask yourself, “Who am I obliged to and is that obligation correct and really appropriate?”</p>
<p>因此，无论你身处何种境况，都要问问你自己：“我如何才能找到内在的内识？我现在需要做什么才能找到内在的内识？我如何才能回归那存在于我内在的真正的确定性，那源自上帝的确定性？我现在需要在生命中做什么才能让我自由地去做这些事，去发现这些事？”问问你自己：“我在哪里把能量浪费在了其他人或其他活动上？”问问你自己：“我对谁负有义务？这种义务是否正确且真正合适？”</p>
<p>Find a place where you can be still. Learn the Steps to Knowledge that God has provided. Use them. Apply them. Follow them patiently. Your life will not change in a day, a week, or a month, but it will change profoundly if you proceed.</p>
<p>找到一个你可以静心的地方。学习上帝提供的内识进阶。运用它们。应用它们。耐心地遵循它们。你的生命不会在一天、一周或一个月内改变，但如果你继续前行，它将发生深刻的改变。</p>
<p>The experience of Knowledge is not simply having a whole new set of ideas, a different theory of life. It is more like having openings in the mind, through which greater messages can come to you, through which you can interpret and see the signs of the world, through which you can listen to your own experience.</p>
<p>内识的体验并非简单地拥有一套全新的想法，一种不同的生命理论。它更像是在心灵中拥有开口，通过它，更伟大的讯息能够来到你身边，通过它，你能够解读并看见世界的迹象，通过它，你能够聆听你自己的体验。</p>
<p>If the mind is like a windowless room, then nothing can come in. You are sealed inside of it, trapped, a prisoner, a slave to your own ideas and beliefs. But experiencing Knowledge, it is like the mind with many open windows, through which life can pass through, through which the signs of life outside yourself can speak to you and re-engage you and refresh you. You can open and close those windows when you need to, but they are there, and they let you see out. They let you see life and the world beyond yourself.</p>
<p>如果心灵就像一间没有窗户的房间，那么什么都进不来。你被封闭在里面，被困住，成为囚徒，成为你自身想法和信念的奴隶。但体验内识，它就像心灵敞开了许多窗户，生命可以通过这些窗户穿梭，你之外的生命迹象可以通过这些窗户与你对话，重新吸引你，让你焕然一新。你可以在需要的时候打开或关闭这些窗户，但它们就在那里，它们让你看到外面的世界。它们让你看到生命，以及你之外的世界。</p>
<p>For all suffering results from self-obsession. This suffering is escaped by serving something greater than your worldly mind, and being a part of something greater than your little tiny personal reality, and finding greater relationships with other people beyond the desperate attempts at pleasure and romance that you see all around you.</p>
<p>因为所有的痛苦都源于自我迷恋。唯有服务超越你世俗心灵的更伟大内识，成为超越你渺小个人现实的更伟大现实的一部分，并超越你周围随处可见的对快乐和浪漫的绝望追求，找到与他人的更伟大关系，才能逃离这种痛苦。</p>
<p>It is time to return to life. The world needs you. God needs you. You need to find your bearings and your true foundation and to build your life upon this true foundation and to take the Steps to Knowledge, which will prepare you for a future that will be unlike the past and which will weaken the hold of the world on you—on your mind, your experience, your emotions and your circumstances.</p>
<p>是时候回归生命了。世界需要你。上帝需要你。你需要找到你的方向和你真正的基础，并在此真正基础上构建你的生命，并开展内识进阶，这将让你为一个不同于过去的未来进行准备，这将削弱世界对你的束缚——对你的心灵、你的体验、你的情感和你的境况的束缚。</p>
<p>This is the journey back. This is what will restore you to who you were before you came into the world, to what you will be after you leave the world and to who and what you must be here now.</p>
<p>这就是回归之旅。它将使你回归到来到这个世界之前的你，回归到你离开这个世界之后的你，回归到你此刻必须成为的人。</p>
