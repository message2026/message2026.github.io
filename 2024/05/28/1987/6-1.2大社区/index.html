<p>As received by Marshall Vian Summers on March 13, 1987 in Reno, Nevada<br>1987 年 3 月 13 日，在内华达州里诺市(Reno, Nevada)，向上帝的信使马歇尔・维安・萨默斯(Marshall Vian Summers)揭示</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Greater Community of worlds is a subject that may be difficult to comprehend intellectually. Yet if this message stirs a deeper emotion within you, that would be good. When We speak of factual matters that are beyond the sphere of individual concerns, it is most important that you not speculate according to your ideas, for ideas alone cannot account for reality. That is why if you feel stirred in your deeper feelings, it is good.</p>
<p>大社区的世界是一个在智力上可能难以领会的主题。然而，如果这个讯息在你的内心激起了一种更深层次的情感，那将是件好事。当我们谈论超越个人关切范围的事实问题时，最重要的是，你不要根据你的想法去推测，因为仅凭想法是无法解释现实的。正因如此，如果你感觉到更深层次的触动，它是好的。</p>
<p>When We speak about relationships and career in the world, people have a more immediate and direct experience of these things. The experience of the Greater Community is not so accessible. It is very interesting, and people are fascinated by it to some degree, but when you go back to your daily personal life, it does not seem very relevant. Yet it is very relevant to your daily concerns because it is relevant to the direction that your world is traveling.</p>
<p>当我们谈论世界上的关系和职业时，人们对这些事情有更直接、更切身的体验。大社区的经验则不那么容易获得。它非常有趣，人们在一定程度上对它着迷，但是当你回到你个人的日常生命时，它似乎并不十分相关。然而，它与你日常的关切密切相关，因为它与你所处世界的发展方向密切相关。</p>
<p>First, let Us say what We mean by the Greater Community. Humanity, unknowingly, is part of a greater association of worlds in this sector. A sector is a delineation of space within physical reality—your local universe, you might say. It is not very great in the larger scope of things, yet in contrast to your measurements, it is quite large.</p>
<p>首先，让我们阐述一下我们所说的大社区是什么意思。人类，在不知不觉中，成为了这个星区中一个更大世界联盟的一部分。星区是物质现实中的一个空间划分——你也可以说，它是你们的本地宇宙。在更大的范围内，它并不十分巨大，然而，与你们的尺度相比，它却相当巨大。</p>
<p>We would like to make the information We present very down to earth, if possible. Of course, it is not really down to earth, yet it is quite relevant to your experience. The reason that it is an important aspect of your daily life is that this world, this planet, is undergoing the transition to emerge into the Greater Community of worlds. This is its evolutionary stage and its place in history. This may seem very distant from your personal interests, yet We can assure you that it has a direct bearing on all the affairs that are happening now.</p>
<p>如果可能的话，我们希望使我们提供的信息非常贴近实际。当然，它不是真正的脚踏实地，然而它与你的经历密切相关。它是你日常生命的一个重要方面，原因是这个世界，这个星球，正在经历过渡，以出现在世界大社区之中。这是它的进化阶段，也是它在历史中的位置。这或许看起来与你的个人利益非常遥远，然而我可以向你保证，它与现在正在发生的所有事情有着直接的关系。</p>
<p>To undergo this emergence, your world has had to accelerate technologically and experience a collapse in its tribal cultures and civilizations. When We speak of tribal, we are not speaking of native peoples only. We are speaking of nations that are now being forged into one another. For when a world undergoes the transition into the Greater Community, out of necessity it must unify its own people. This is evolutionary. It occurs in all worlds where intelligent life has been seeded.</p>
<p>为了经历在大社区中的出现，你们的世界不得不加速科技发展，并经历其部落文化和文明的崩溃。当我们谈论部落时，我们指的不仅仅是原住民。我们谈论的是现在正在相互融合的国家。因为当一个世界经历向大社区的过渡时，出于必要性，世界必须统一它自己的人民。这是进化的过程。它发生在所有智能生命被播种的世界。</p>
<p>Therefore, if you bear witness to the events in your world, you will see that your world is racing to a culminating experience. Everyone feels this, but not many people know what it is about. As in all great turning points, catastrophes, apocalypses and messianic arrivals are predicted. This always occurs at times of transition because people feel they must give some kind of explanation to account for this deeper experience of change.</p>
<p>因此，如果你见证了你所在世界中的事件，你会看到你的世界正在奔向一种顶点的体验。每个人都能感受到这一点，但很少有人知道这究竟意味着什么。正如所有伟大的转折点一样，灾难、末日和救世主的降临都被预言了。这种情况总是发生在过渡的时期，因为人们觉得他们必须给出某种解释来说明这种更深层次的变革体验。</p>
<p>It is quite essential that you have this viewpoint because it allows you to experience your environment and your relationships from beyond your own personal inventory of feelings and concerns. If you are dominated by your own anxieties and wishes, then you will not be able to see what is happening. You will not be able to perceive life as it is truly functioning and evolving.</p>
<p>拥有这种视角至关重要，因为它能让你超越你自己的感受和担忧，去体验你的环境与你的关系。如果你被你自己的焦虑和愿望所支配，你就无法看清正在发生的事情。你将无法感知生命的真实运作与演变。</p>
<p>Of course, your personal issues must be addressed, and your personal dilemmas must in time find resolution. Yet part of this resolution is realizing that your life is functioning within a greater context. This is as true for you, functioning individually in a greater society of people, as it is true for your world functioning in a Greater Community of worlds.</p>
<p>当然，你的个人问题必须得到解决，你的个人困境必须及时找到解决的方法。然而，这种解决的一部分是意识到你的生命是在一个更伟大的背景下运作的。这对于你作为一个个体在一个更大的人类社会中的运作来说，同样适用，就像你们的世界在大社区的世界中运作一样。</p>
<p>Why is the Greater Community important? It is something everyone knows exists. Your belief system may account for it or not. Your ideas may speak of it or not. It may be a subject of personal interest or not. Yet everyone knows it exists. Everyone knows that humanity, in its slight ventures into space, in its rapid technological development, in the collapse of its tribal civilizations, will inevitably emerge into the Greater Community. It is very important to see this because if you fight against the evolutionary forces that are shaping your world, then you will not be in harmony with your own life’s purpose.</p>
<p>为什么大社区是重要的？每个人都知道它的存在。你们的信念体系或许解释了它，或许没有。你们的想法或许提及它，或许没有。它或许是个人感兴趣的话题，或许不是。然而，每个人都知道它的存在。每个人都知道，人类，在其对太空的轻微试探中，在其快速的科技发展中，在其部落文明的崩溃中，终将不可避免地迈入大社区。看到这一点非常重要，因为如果你对抗那些正在塑造你们世界的进化驱动力，那么你将无法与你自己的生命目的和谐相处。</p>
<p>Higher purpose is a central theme in this Teaching, but higher purpose cannot be based upon idealism. It cannot be based upon what you think the world should be, for there is no foundation there, and you will deceive yourself and others. Your higher purpose is based upon the true evolutionary progress that is occurring now.</p>
<p>更高宗旨是这个教程的核心主题，但更高宗旨不能基于理想主义。它不能基于你认为世界应该是什么样子，因为那里没有基础，你将欺骗你自己和他人。你的更高宗旨基于现在正在发生的真正进化进程。</p>
<p>To discover higher purpose is to discover your role in serving this constructively. If you think about these things, they will take you beyond your own personal sphere of concerns and wishes. This is healthy. It is important that your world is demanding your attention, yet it must demand your attention in a special way.</p>
<p>发现更高宗旨，就是发现你在建设性地服务于此目的中的角色。如果你思考这些事情，它们将带你超越个人的担忧和愿望。它是健康的。重要的是，你们的世界需要你的关注，然而它必须以一种特殊的方式来要求你的关注。</p>
<p>Humanity is preoccupied with itself as adolescents are preoccupied with themselves. Human beings, upon reaching adulthood, mature largely because they begin to account for a greater reality beyond themselves and to respond to the needs of others. This represents the predicament of your world now. It is emerging into a greater reality, yet it is still preoccupied with itself. There are very serious dangers here and very great opportunities.</p>
<p>人类专注于它自身，正如青少年专注于他们自己一样。人类在成年后之所以成熟，很大程度上是因为他们开始考虑超越他们自身之外的一个更伟大现实，并对他人的需求做出回应。这代表着你们世界当下的困境。它正在迈向一个更伟大的现实，然而它依然专注于它自身。这里存在着非常严重的危险，也蕴藏着非常伟大的机遇。</p>
<p>Many of you have felt strangely moved emotionally in these recent times. You may think it is your own personal development, but that cannot account for everything. You [may] say to yourself, “Something is happening, but I don’t know what it is. I can feel it. I know something is about to happen, but I don’t know what it is.”</p>
<p>你们中的许多人在最近的这些时间里，在情感上感到奇怪的波动。你可能认为这是你自己的个人发展，但这并不能解释一切。你或许会对你自己说：“有些事情正在发生，但我不知道它是什么。我可以感觉到它。我知道有些事情即将发生，但我不知道它是什么。”</p>
<p>The Greater Community is having a tremendous impact here, and it will increase as the years go [on]. There is much speculation now that your world will undergo tremendous disaster, breakdown and so forth. We wish to dispel much of this, for this is projection. Yet it is indeed true that you will undergo a greater change than you have ever known. After all, what is the value of your religion and your sociological emphasis when you see that the universe is not based upon you? This recognition will change things very much. It will also unite your world, for your world will now have a greater problem to contend with.</p>
<p>大社区正在这里产生极大的影响，而且随着时间的推移，这种影响还会增强。现在有很多猜测，说你们的世界将经历巨大的灾难、崩溃等等。我们希望消除其中的大部分猜测，因为这只是投射。然而，你们确实将经历一场比你们所知的一种更伟大的变革。毕竟，当你们看到宇宙并非以你们为基础时，你们的宗教和社会学所强调的价值又何在呢？这种认知将极大地改变事物。它还将使你们的世界团结起来，因为你们的世界现在将面临一个更大的问题需要应对。</p>
<p>When We talk about the Greater Community, We are speaking of a tremendous transition in understanding. Here you realize that the God whom you aspire to reach, or perhaps whom you worship or idealize, is not human. In fact, God does not even think like a human because God cannot do that. Here you realize that you are only part of Creation. This becomes much more evident now, requiring a greater vision of the world and a more expansive view of religion and spiritual development.</p>
<p>当我们谈论大社区时，我们谈论的是理解上的极大转变。在这里，你意识到你渴望触及上帝，或者也许是你崇拜的或理想化的上帝，并不是人类。事实上，上帝甚至不会像人一样思考，因为上帝无法这样做。在这里，你意识到你只是创造的一部分。这一点现在变得更加明显，需要一种更伟大的世界观，以及一种更广阔的宗教和精神发展观。</p>
<p>You see, your religious traditions have been centered upon humanity alone, but you are already part of a Greater Community, and your Ancient Heritage before this life included lives in other worlds as well. That is why many of you have had great difficulty in adjusting to being here. For some of you, your Heritage lies beyond this world, and it is strange for you to be here.</p>
<p>你看，你们的宗教传统一直只以人类为中心，但你们早已是一个大社区的组成部分，你在这个生命之前的古老传承也涵盖了其他世界的生命。这就是为什么你们中的许多人在适应这里的存在着很大的困难。对你们中的一些人来说，你们的传承在这个世界之外，身处此地对你们来说是一种奇特的体验。</p>
<p>Why are you here now in a world that seems so odd, so difficult and so alien to you? It is because people who have this background have a major contribution to make to the world’s emergence into the Greater Community. It is their Heritage they must contribute, not only their ideas. Yet until they find this, they will be profoundly alienated, and they will have great difficulty with their own temperament and nature, which in many ways seem incompatible with this world.</p>
<p>为什么你现在身处一个对你来说如此奇怪、如此困难、如此陌生的世界上？它是因为拥有这种背景的人们，对世界向大社区的迈进有着主要贡献。他们必须贡献的是他们的传承，而不仅仅是他们的想法。然而，在他们找到这一点之前，他们将被深深地疏远，他们将难以适应他们自己的气质和自然，它在许多方面似乎与这个世界格格不入。</p>
<p>Emergence into the Greater Community brings an expansion of love and intrinsic relationship. It also means that your personal lives are seen in a greater context and that your personal problems can be understood from a larger point of view.</p>
<p>迈入大社区，带来爱与固有关系的扩展。它也意味着你的个人生命被放置在一个更伟大的背景下看待，你的个人问题也将从更大的视角得到理解。</p>
<p>There is war in the world now because tribal cultures are breaking down. The world must, out of necessity, become a unified community. Why is this so? It is so because this is evolution. It is completely predictable wherever intelligent life has colonized. When this great turning point comes, it will be a time of tremendous stress and development. This is what many of you feel within yourselves—stress and development. Change is rarely graceful.</p>
<p>如今世界战乱不已，是因为部落文化正在瓦解。出于必要性，世界必须成为一个统一的社区。为什么会这样？因为这就是进化。凡是有智能生命殖民的地方，它是完全可以预见的。当这个伟大的转折点到来时，它将是一个充满巨大压力和发展的时间。这就是你们中的许多人在你们自己内心感受到的——压力与发展。改变很少是优雅的。</p>
<p>The oppositions that exist in this world will be overshadowed by difficulties from abroad in the Greater Community. You may say, “We do not need greater difficulties. We have enough difficulties. No more difficulties!” But greater difficulties can solve lesser ones. Many of the preoccupations with your human difficulties will dissolve in the face of a larger challenge. This is good for your people in many ways.</p>
<p>这个世界存在的对立将被来自大社区的外部困难所掩盖。你或许会说：“我们不需要更大的困难。我们已经有足够多的困难了。不再需要更多的困难！”但更大的困难可以解决较小的困难。在更大的挑战面前，许多对你们人类困难的关注将被消解。这在许多方面对你们的人民是有益的。</p>
<p>We and members of your Spiritual Family account for life in numerous places. Altogether We bring a larger expanse of understanding, a greater appreciation for life in many forms and an awareness of the difficulties that face true spiritual development everywhere.</p>
<p>我们与你精神家庭的成员，对众多地方的生命有所阐释。我们携手，带来了更大范围内的理解，对各种形式的生命有一种更伟大的欣赏，并觉知世界各地真正的精神发展所面临的种种困境。</p>
<p>The Greater Community is not made up of enlightened beings who are all anxiously waiting to come and enlighten humankind. Your neighbors from abroad share many of your same difficulties. If they were as enlightened as many of you wish they were, they would not be in physical reality. Because they exist on the physical plane, they essentially all have the same difficulties that you do. Though their physical, biological and psychological processes vary greatly, they are not perfect because they are still in physical reality. Their technological advances do not necessarily mean that they have advanced in their inner lives, in spiritual matters.</p>
<p>大社区并非由那些焦急地等待着到来启迪人类的开明生命组成。你们的外星邻居与你们有许多相同的困难。如果他们真如你们许多人所希望的那样开明，他们就不会存在于物质现实中。因为他们存在于物质层面，他们本质上与你们面临着相同的困难。尽管他们的物理、生理和心理过程千差万别，但他们并不完美，因为他们仍然处于物质现实中。他们的技术进步并不一定意味着他们在内在生命或精神事务上有所进步。</p>
<p>Technological development is problematic. It is a different kind of development from spiritual development within a race. Actually, your world is quite evolved spiritually, contrary to what many here think. You are very evolved, very rich spiritually.</p>
<p>技术发展是有问题的。它与一个种族的精神发展截然不同。事实上，你们的世界在精神上已经相当发达，与这里许多人认为的相反。你们是非常进化的，精神上非常丰富。</p>
<p>There are difficulties in the Greater Community as there are difficulties here. They are simply on a greater scale, that is all. There are opposing forces in this sector that you must realize, for life beyond this world is not that unlike your life here. Conflicts exist, alliances exist, betrayal exists, and the spiritual Presence works everywhere. So do not get too involved in the drama of things. It is the spiritual Presence at work that is the most important. Your world is undergoing the same problems that you are undergoing individually. It is simply a larger picture of yourself. The Greater Community is simply a larger picture of your world.</p>
<p>大社区中存在的困难和这里的困难是一样的。它们只是在更大的规模上，仅此而已。在这个区域中有一些对立的势力，你必须意识到，因为这个世界之外的生命与你在这里的生命并没有什么不同。冲突存在，联盟存在，背叛存在，并且精神存在的工作无处不在。所以，不要太过沉迷于世间的戏剧性。最重要的是工作中的精神存在。你们的世界正在经历着你正在经历的同样问题。它只是你自己的一个更大图景。大社区只是你们世界的一个更大图景。</p>
<p>If you are to function in a Greater Community context, then you must prepare both internally and externally, primarily in your viewpoint and in the foundation of your thinking. Entering the Greater Community is entering a larger sphere of interaction. If you are idealistic like the young adolescent, you will misperceive the situation and make false assumptions that can only be unlearned through difficulty and error. But if you enter this larger sphere with an open mind, recognizing how little you know and anxious to learn, then you shall find the counsel you need.</p>
<p>如果你要在大社区的背景下运作，那么你必须在内部和外部做好准备，主要是在你的视角和你的思维基础上。进入大社区就是进入一个更广阔的互动领域。如果你像青少年一样理想主义，你将会误解情况，做出错误的假设，而这些假设只能通过困难与错误来解除。但如果你带着开放的心灵进入这个更广阔的领域，认识到你所知道的是多么的匮乏，并且渴望学习，那么你就能找到你需要的建议。</p>
<p>Your world is preparing technologically, economically and even politically for emergence into the Greater Community. It is as if humanity were unknowingly racing to a certain meeting place. You cannot account for this completely unless you see it within a larger context.</p>
<p>你的世界正在技术上、经济上、甚至政治上为进入大社区进行准备。人类仿佛在不知不觉中奔向一个特定的聚集地点。除非你在更大的背景下看到它，否则你无法完全解释这一点。</p>
<p>It is essential if you are to undertake space travel that your planet become one community. That is a requirement. All worlds undergo this. They must be unified to travel beyond their realm or they cannot do it, and their technology will become destructive.</p>
<p>如果你们要进行太空旅行，你们的星球必须成为一个社区。这是一个要求。所有星球都要经历这个过程。它们必须团结起来才能跨越他们的领域进行旅行，否则就无法进行，而且它们的技术也会变得毁灭性。</p>
<p>This idea of a Greater Community is something that everyone knows, but people do not want to talk about it. It either seems irrelevant to their personal needs, or it is so fantastic that they are afraid others will laugh at them. Yet people do have their deeper feelings.</p>
<p>这个关于大社区的想法是每个人都知道的，但人们不想谈论它。它要么看起来与他们的个人需求无关，要么太过奇特，以至于他们害怕被他人嘲笑。然而，人们确实有着更深层次的感受。</p>
<p>You see, you are like a little village that is about to find itself in the midst of a bigger world. Your little village has never encountered a bigger world, yet you live in one nonetheless. You must continue to expand as a race.</p>
<p>你看，你们就像一个小村庄，即将置身于一个更大的世界之中。你们的小村庄从未接触过更大的世界，但你们却生活在其中。作为一个种族，你们必须继续扩展。</p>
<p>Placed within your Knowledge when you came into this world was certain information that is relevant to your role, should it ever be discovered. That has direct bearing on the events to come because you were placed here in the hope that your Knowledge may be activated and that its gifts may be given at the proper time.</p>
<p>当你来到这个世界时，你的内识中就蕴藏着与你角色相关的特定信息，如果它被发现的话。这些信息与未来的事件直接相关，因为你被安置在这里，希望你的内识可以被激活，它的礼物可以在适当的时间被给予。</p>
<p>Spiritual development in all times and in all places must happen in accordance with the evolution of the world in which individuals are placed, not only for their own individual development but for the well-being of all life living there. Your individual nature and temperament are well suited to fulfill your function, but if your function is unknown to you, then you will not understand their relevance.</p>
<p>所有时间和所有地点的精神发展都必须根据个人所处世界的进化而发生，这不仅是为了他们自己的个体发展，也是为了生活在那里所有生命的福祉。你的个人天性和气质很适合履行你的职能，但如果你的职能不为你所知，那么你就不会理解它们的相关性。</p>
<p>The Greater Community is with you now. All of this emphasis on extraterrestrials is very recent. Of all the illustrations of extraterrestrials, the wild speculation and the fantasy, much of it is useless and nonsense. Yet the seed of it is true. Why is this all happening now? You may say, “What difference does it make to me? I don’t care. I have my own problems!” Yet the Greater Community is influencing you emotionally, and it is changing your circumstances.</p>
<p>大社区现在与你们同在。所有这些对外星人的强调都是最近才出现的。所有关于外星人的例证、疯狂的猜测和幻想，其中大部分都是无用且荒谬的。然而，它的种子是真实的。为什么这一切现在才发生？你可能会说：“这跟我有什么关系？我并不关心。我有我自己的问题！”然而，大社区正在影响你的情感，它正在改变你的环境。</p>
<p>People are very interested in peace in this world, but there cannot be peace now. Do you know why? It is because of what We speak of. We work for peace always, but We recognize that change is very stressful. It involves decision, commitment and adjustment as well as some sacrifices. This is true of change both on a personal level and on a greater level. Why can there not be peace now? Because your world is attempting to unify itself, and all factions in your world that refuse to do this will wage war. It is very sad that this is true.</p>
<p>人们对这个世界的和平非常感兴趣，但现在却不会有和平。你知道为什么吗？它是因为我们所说的大社区。我们始终致力于和平，但我们认识到改变会带来巨大的压力。它需要决策、承诺与调整，以及一些牺牲。无论是在个人层面还是在一个更伟大的层面，改变都是如此。为什么现在不能有和平？因为你们的世界正试图统一它自己，而你们世界中拒绝这样做的所有派系都会发起战争。它是非常可悲的，但这是事实。</p>
<p>Do not demand that everyone settle down in peace. You will be working against the undercurrent in this world. We never advocate conflict, but you must understand that conflict arises in times of great change. With every great advancement in your world, there is tremendous combustion and upheaval. It is not because change requires this. It is simply because people cannot see beyond themselves.</p>
<p>不要要求每个人都在和平中安定下来。你将在这个世界的暗流中工作。我们从不提倡冲突，但你必须理解，冲突是在伟大变革时期产生的。你们世界的每一次伟大进步，都伴随着极大的冲突和动荡。它并不是因为变革需要如此，原因很简单，因为人们无法看到他们自己之外的内识。</p>
<p>If you look, you will see. But if all you can see are your own thoughts, then that is all you will see. If you are not thinking, you will see what is there. If you are preoccupied with your own thinking, you will only see your own thoughts. We want to stimulate people to look without thinking so that they may see what is there and respond to it directly, like your animals do. They do not have the burden of reckless thinking.</p>
<p>如果你观察，你就会看见。但如果你所能看到的只是你自己的思想，那么你看到的也只有这些。如果你没有在思考，你就会看到眼前的事物。如果你专注于你自己的思维，你只会看到你自己的思想。我们想要鼓励人们不假思索地观察，这样他们就能看到那里的事物，并像你们的动物一样直接做出反应。他们没有鲁莽思考的负担。</p>
<p>The Greater Community must be approached through Knowledge. If you speculate about it intellectually, you will find yourself liking the idea or not, but that says nothing about what you know. Therefore, Our primary emphasis is the development of Knowledge so that you may gain access to what is known within you, this precious cargo that you carry unknowingly. Until this happens, your life will not make sense. It will seem aimless and without consistent direction. The only consistency you will have is that you know you are progressing towards something for some reason to serve a Greater Power.</p>
<p>大社区必须通过内识来触及。如果你在智力上推测它，你会发现你自己喜欢或不喜欢这个想法，但这并不能说明你所知道的是什么。因此，我们首要的重点是内识的发展，这样你就能触及你内在知道的内识，这是你在不知不觉中携带的珍贵货物。除非这发生，否则你的生命将毫无意义。它将显得漫无目的，缺乏一致的方向。你唯一能保持一致的是，你知道你出于某种原因正在朝着某个方向前进，为一种更伟大的力量服务。</p>
<p>The more you are with Knowledge, the less the world will affect you because the world cannot touch Knowledge. But Knowledge can touch the world. Knowledge is not swayed by the world. It has one purpose and one direction. As it emerges within the person, the person becomes uniform and focused and then commitment is natural. You cannot be anything but committed. Commitment is life. To be uncommitted is to be dead. You cannot make commitments. You can make pledges to try to be committed, but your real commitment comes from within you. It commits you. When Knowledge emerges, you will not have any choice about commitment. Your Knowledge is totally committed.</p>
<p>你越是与内识在一起，世界对你的影响就越小，因为世界无法触及内识。但内识可以触及世界。内识不受世界左右。它有一个目的和一个方向。当它在一个人的内在显现时，这个人就会变得统一与集中，然后承诺是自然的。除了承诺，你无法成为任何人。承诺就是生命。不承诺就等于死亡。你无法做出承诺。但你可以试图做出承诺，但你真正的承诺来自于你的内心。它使你承诺。当内识显现时，你将没有任何关于承诺的选择。你的内识是完全承诺的。</p>
<p>Knowledge is a gift that you have, but it is also your true Being. It has a plan for your life already and once activated, it will begin to exert itself in a much more direct way. You will realize you do not need the burden of decision, for increasingly Knowledge will motivate you, guide you and direct you, gracefully, but powerfully. Then you will be able to extend the greatest gift that one can give to another. Your Knowledge will activate their Knowledge, and you will bear witness to this great event. This is true healing, for once this happens, the person’s emergence will begin, and they will be entering a greater reality while they are still living in the world.</p>
<p>内识是你拥有的一份礼物，但它也是你真正的存在。它已经为你的生命制定了计划，一旦被激活，它就会以一种更直接的方式开始发挥作用。你会意识到你不再需要做出决定的负担，因为内识会越来越多地激励你、指导你、指引你，优雅而有力。然后，你将能够将一个人能够给予另一个人的最伟大礼物延伸出去。你的内识将激活他们的内识，你将见证这个伟大的事件。这是真正的治愈，因为一旦发生，这个人的崛起将开始，他们将进入一个更伟大的现实，而他们仍然生活在这个世界上。</p>
<p>It is hard to see that you are already part of something greater that is affecting you very deeply. It is not that you will become part of something. You already are. You are already part of a greater physical reality and a greater spiritual reality.</p>
<p>很难看到，你已经是更伟大关系的一部分，它正在深深地影响着你。它并不是说你会成为某种关系的一部分。你已经是了。你已经是一个更伟大的物质现实与一个更伟大的精神现实的一部分。</p>
<p>Why do you need Teachers? Because you cannot cultivate Knowledge on your own. It is far more powerful than you are. It recognizes you as intrinsically part of something already, so separation is already over. Knowledge does not act like a separated mind. It is not preoccupied with survival. It does not have defenses. It is the power of the Spiritual Family and the power of God manifested in the physical.</p>
<p>你为什么还需要老师呢？因为你不能靠你自己培养内识。它远比你强大得多。它承认你已经是固有关系的组成部分，所以分离已经结束。内识不像一个分离的心灵那样运作。它不执着于生存。它没有防卫。它是精神家庭的力量，也是上帝的力量在物质中的显现。</p>
<p>Spiritual teaching at this time must account for the state of the world. You have all been placed in time and space in history. Your Knowledge and your purpose contain a particular application for a particular time. Though spiritual advancement is universal, it is always historically placed. You came here specifically for a purpose to serve in a specific capacity at this time.</p>
<p>这个时间的精神教导必须考虑到世界的现状。你被安置在历史的时间和空间之中。你的内识与你的目的包含着针对特定时间的特定应用。尽管精神上的进步是普世的，但它总是被放置在历史之上。你来到这里，是为了一个特定的目的，在这个时间以特定的身份去服务。</p>
<p>It behooves you then to understand what is happening in the world; otherwise, you will see no relevance for your sense of purpose. Since purpose speaks of service to a greater reality than your own personal reality, you must see beyond your personal reality, or purpose will be an idea only.</p>
<p>那么，你有必要去理解世界上正在发生的事情；否则，你会发现你的目的感没有任何关联性。既然目的意味着服务于一个比你自己个人现实的更伟大现实，你就必须超越你个人的现实，否则目的将只能是一个想法。</p>
<p>Hear Our lesson, please. We will tell you about a race in the Greater Community that was advanced far beyond what you can imagine, yet they did not have Knowledge. They did not become aware of events before they happened. They were not prepared. They were specialists in technological development, yet they fell prey to a Greater Community that they did not understand because they did not have Knowledge. Therefore, they were ignorant of the forces around them. And though they contracted to make devices for other races, they did not understand the intent of the other races, nor did they wish to. They were isolated and ignorant and, as a result, their civilization is no more. This loss was a major loss, even for the Spiritual Families. It was a setback. Yet because truth emanates from beyond time, redemption will occur. But it is a lost opportunity.</p>
<p>请聆听我们的课程。我们将讲述大社区中的一个种族的故事，它的先进性远远超出你们的想象，然而他们缺乏内识。他们未能在事件发生前觉察到它们。他们没有做好准备。他们是技术发展方面的专家，然而他们却沦为一个他们并不理解的大社区的牺牲品，因为他们缺乏内识。因此，他们对他们周围的势力一无所知。尽管他们签署为其他种族制造设备，但他们并不理解其他种族的意图，他们也不想理解。他们孤立无援，无知无觉，结果，他们的文明不复存在。这次损失是一次重大损失，即使对精神家庭而言也是如此。它是一个挫折。然而，因为真理来自于时间之外，所以救赎将会发生。但它是一个失去的机会。</p>
<p>If you do not activate Knowledge in your life, your life is a lost opportunity. This you will reflect upon when you leave, as did the seers in this other world. They could not change their world. They could not speak intelligently of Knowledge to their own people. The Unseen Ones, the Angelic Presence, contacted the seers, and they were developed while in physical life, yet what the seers spoke of gained very little attention. Their race had created a device of great power. They created it because of their own inventiveness and their own curiosity. Because they lived underground, they wished to learn a means of travel that was not impeded by physical obstacles. It had a very practical benefit, yet they had no idea of the meaning of this to other races. Therefore, they were ignorant of what they were doing. How could the seers of this world dissuade their whole race, who were very excited about this new technology?</p>
<p>如果你不在你的生命中激活内识，你的生命就是一次失去的机会。当你离开时，你会反思这一点，就像另一个世界的先知们一样。他们无法改变他们的世界。他们不能明智地向他们自己的族人讲述内识。不可见者，天使的存在，与先知们的联系，他们在物质生命中得到了发展，然而先知们所讲述的讯息却很少得到关注。他们的种族创造了一个具有伟大力量的装置。他们创造它，是因为他们自身的创造力和好奇心。因为他们生活在地下，他们希望学习一种不受物理障碍和阻碍的旅行方式。它有一个非常实用的益处，然而他们不知道这对其他种族意味着什么。因此，他们对他们正在做的事情一无所知。这个世界的先知们如何能够劝阻他们整个种族，而他们的族人却对这项新的技术感到如此兴奋？</p>
<p>It is important that you understand that your world is emerging within itself and beyond itself in the Greater Community and that you are emerging with it. Emergence always has a certain element of risk.</p>
<p>重要的是，你要理解，你们的世界正在进入大社区，在它自身之内和之外出现，而你们也正在随之出现。崛起总是带有一定的风险因素。</p>
<p>For those of you who have been seeking to find a place to give something you feel you have, the Greater Community will have much bearing on your sense of purpose in the world. You cannot find it in the normal sphere of things. You must think in a bigger way. When We speak of the Greater Community, We speak of a larger perspective on everything, including yourself most assuredly.</p>
<p>对于那些一直在寻找一个地方来给予你所拥有礼物的人来说，大社区将对你在这个世界上的目的感有重大影响。你无法在日常的事物范围内找到它。你必须以更大的视角去思考。当我们说到大社区时，我们说的是对一切事物的更大视角，当然也包括你自己。</p>
<p>Your role is not preordained, but once your purpose is discovered, it will activate your mind and body and guide and direct you to participate with certain people for certain purposes that are greater than even your own development. This is an entirely different way of being in the world. It is what you are striving for primarily.</p>
<p>你的角色不是预先设定的，但一旦你的目的被发现，它就会激活你的身心，指导和引导你与特定的人一起参与特定的目的，这些目的甚至比你自己的发展更伟大。这是一种完全不同的存在于世界的方式。它是你主要追求的目的。</p>
<p>Therefore, when We speak of the Greater Community, We speak of it as being relevant to your purpose in the world. This world cannot stop where it is going; it must go there. You cannot stop; you must go where you are going. If your destiny is reached through wisdom, it will be constructive and uplifting, and you will progress. Yet if you interfere with it, fight against it and demand it to be other than it is, you will not be in harmony with your world or with yourself. For your Knowledge is completely joined with the Knowledge that governs this world. That is why We always speak of Knowledge as the most important thing. It is not ideas. It is acting according to your deeper Mind. It is a greater instinct.</p>
<p>因此，当我们讲述大社区时，我们说它与你在世界上的目的有关。这个世界无法停止它正在前往的地方；它必须前往那里。你也无法停止；你也必须前往你正在前往的地方。如果你的天命是通过智慧达成的，它将是建设性的、令人振奋的，你也会取得进步。然而，如果你干扰它、与它抗争、要求它变成其他的样子，你将无法与你们的世界或与你自己和谐相处。因为你的内识完全与管理这个世界的内识结合在一起。这就是为什么我们总是把内识说成是最重要的关系。它不是想法。它是根据你更深层次的心灵而行动。它是一种更伟大的本能。</p>
<p>We do not want to frighten you. We want you to think in a bigger way—not idealistically, not like you want the world to be the way you imagine it should be. You do not even know what this world is for. How can you imagine what it should be for? It will never be Heaven. It will never be home to you completely. You are only visiting here. This is a special place for something special to happen.</p>
<p>我们不想吓唬你。我们希望你从更大的角度去思考问题——不是理想主义，更不是希望世界变成你想象中的样子。你甚至不知道这个世界是为了什么。你怎么能想象它应该是为了什么？它永远不会成为天堂。它永远不会完全成为你的家。你只是在这里的访客。这是一个特殊的地方，会发生一些特别的事情。</p>
<p>If you can let down your ideas, then you will begin to know things, just know things—that rare experience you have had at times of great distress or great decision. Then this faculty that is your true Mind will begin to be active without confrontation.</p>
<p>如果你能放下你的想法，那么你将开始知道一些事情，仅仅是知道一些事情——那是你在极度痛苦或重大抉择时所拥有的罕见体验。然后，这个你真正的心灵功能将开始在没有对抗的情况下活跃起来。</p>
<p>Why do people go out and create terrible situations for themselves? It is because they want to create a situation that forces Knowledge to come to the surface. Knowledge will not arise in a preoccupied mind under normal circumstances. When everything is going your way, you are very stupid. You are half asleep. That is not what brings Knowledge forth. Yet if Knowledge is not arising, you will go to extremes to bring it forth. It is like giving birth to something you are carrying and laboring with.</p>
<p>为什么人们要出去为他们自己创造可怕的处境？这是因为他们想要创造一个迫使内识浮出水面的情况。在正常情况下，内识不会在一个全神贯注的心灵中浮现。当一切都在按你的方式进行时，你是非常愚蠢的。你处于半睡半醒的状态。这不是带来内识的原因。然而，如果内识没有浮现，你就会采取极端的方式来使它出现。它就像是生下你所怀有的孩子，并为之努力分娩。</p>
<p>Do you see? The Greater Community will change your ideas about God completely. It will change your ideas about religion completely. You will see that God is not preoccupied with humans. You will see that God is something bigger than what you have ever considered, and you will have to think as a participant in a greater reality. This is a great blessing.</p>
<p>你看到了吗？大社区将完全改变你对上帝的想法。它将完全改变你对宗教的想法。你会看到，上帝并不全神贯注于人类。你将看到上帝比你曾经想象的更伟大，你将必须作为一个更伟大现实的参与者来进行思考。这是一个伟大的祝福。</p>
<p>Why are nations in this world always threatening each other? They are so similar to one another, yet they accuse each other of the greatest evils. What will resolve this dilemma? They love each other, but they cannot join, so they fight. That is why people fight. They cannot separate. They cannot join. So they fight.</p>
<p>为什么这个世界上的国家总是互相威胁？他们彼此是如此相似，却又互相指责对方的最大罪恶。如何才能化解这个困境？他们彼此相爱，但他们却无法联合，所以他们斗争。这就是人们斗争的原因。他们无法分开，也无法加入，因此他们斗争。</p>
<p>That is what is happening now. Nations cannot join, but they cannot separate. Yet they will have to join. They will join because they will realize that they are exactly alike, and they will become increasingly similar in the years to come. Why will they join? Because they will be faced with a Greater Community beyond their borders. This may be the saving grace in this world. Humanity will have to contend with a bigger problem than the differences between nations that are so alike.</p>
<p>这就是现在正在发生的事情。国家之间无法融合，但它们也无法分开。然而他们将不得不加入。它们将融合，因为它们将意识到它们完全相似，并且在未来的岁月中，它们将变得越来越相似。它们为何要融合？因为他们将要面对一个他们边界之外的大社区。这可能是这个世界的拯救之恩。人类将不得不面对一个更大的问题，而不是那些如此相似国家之间的差异。</p>
<p>There is spiritual advancement happening everywhere. That is why the Teachers of the Spiritual Families serve all worlds. If you ever have the gift of encountering your Inner Teachers who have been assigned to you, you will recognize that not all of them are human. Why is this? Is it not to bring forth your Knowledge, which speaks of a greater reality and a Greater Community and which takes you beyond your personal sphere to allow you to enter life? We give entering life such great importance.</p>
<p>精神上的进步无处不在。这就是为什么精神家庭的老师们服务于所有世界。如果你有机会遇见分配给你的内在老师，你就会意识到，他们并非全是人类。为什么是这样呢？难道它不是为了带你走向内识吗？它讲述着一个更伟大的现实和一个更伟大的社区，它带领你超越你的个人领域，让你能够进入生命？我们把进入生命看得如此重要。</p>
<p>It is unfortunate if the development of Knowledge is misconstrued to be on a personal level only. Knowledge will make your personal self more harmonious, uniform and consistent, but only so you may have capacity for something greater. There is a Godseed in all people, but the seed must be germinated and have fertile soil in which to emerge.</p>
<p>如果内识的发展被错误理解为只在个人的层面上，那将是不幸的。内识将使你的个人自我更加和谐、统一和一致，但这也只是为了让你拥有成就更伟大事情的能力。每个人心中都有一颗上帝的种子，但这颗种子必须发芽，并拥有肥沃的土壤才能生长。</p>
<p>Therefore, when We speak of the Greater Community, do not think only about spaceships. That is not the point. Instead, think of the Greater Community in terms of what you experience in life.</p>
<p>因此，当我们谈论大社区时，不要只想到宇宙飞船。这不是重点。相反，要从你在生命中所经历的视角来思考大社区。</p>
<p>When you observe others, observe their preoccupation with themselves. They are not available for relationship. They cannot participate in life. Their chief concerns are survival and gratification. That is a very desperate situation to be in—to be in life, but cut off.</p>
<p>当你观察他人时，要观察他们对他们自己的专注。他们没有机会建立关系，他们无法参与到生命中。他们最关心的是生存和满足。这是一种非常令人绝望的情况——身处生命，却又与生命隔绝。</p>
<p>This you hold in common with your brothers and sisters in the Greater Community: You either have Knowledge or you do not. That is all that matters. Their life is temporary and yours is as well. The seed has been placed within them as well as within you.</p>
<p>这是你和你在大社区的兄弟姐妹们共同持有的：你要么拥有内识，要么没有。这才是最重要的。他们的生命是短暂的，你的生命也是如此。种子已经被放置在他们的内心和你的内心。</p>
<p>Grace is available to you so that Knowledge may emerge. You do not need to control the emergence; it is quite natural. But you do need to exert control over your behavior and your tendencies so that this emergence can happen.</p>
<p>恩典对你来说是可用的，以便内识可以出现。你无需控制它的出现；它是非常自然的。但你确实需要掌控你的行为和你的倾向，以便这种涌现能够发生。</p>
<p>It is like a great pregnancy. Your lifestyle and your values must change to accommodate it because like the expectant mother, you will wish to prepare a place for delivery—the proper environment, the proper support and the proper orientation. And you will protect this emergence because it is vital now.</p>
<p>它就像一次伟大的怀孕。你的生活方式和价值观必须改变来适应它，因为就像准妈妈一样，你会希望为分娩准备一个地方——合适的环境、合适的支持与合适的方向。而且你会保护这种诞生，因为它现在至关重要。</p>
<p>There are many people who are experiencing this pregnancy, and it is very difficult on a personal level to account for it. It does not matter that your personal side is so foolish, it does not matter that your body is not perfect, and it does not matter that you are beset by little ideas and fears. These are only minor hindrances compared to what you possess.</p>
<p>许多人正在经历这种怀孕，从个人的角度来说，要解释清楚这一点非常困难。你的个人方面如此愚蠢并不重要，你的身体不完美也并不重要，甚至你被小想法与恐惧所困扰也不重要。与你所拥有的相比，这些都只是微不足道的障碍。</p>
<p>It is because you identify completely with your personal side that you are so anxious to make it as perfect as your true Self. But it can never be. It was never meant to be. Therefore, please be kind to yourself. Your vehicle is not your true Self. It is not Knowledge. It is a self-created vehicle for participation in the world.</p>
<p>正是因为你完全认同你个人的一面，你才如此急切地想让它像你的真实自我一样完美。但它永远不可能。它从来就不该如此。所以，请善待你自己。你的载体并非你的真实自我。它并非内识。它只是你为了参与世界而自我创造的载体。</p>
<p>That is why We wish for people who are experiencing this rapid growth to be very kind, patient and considerate with themselves and with others. You will find that your Teachers are very gentle and patient with you. They are not so concerned that you comprehend everything right away. They are only concerned that you not destroy your opportunity for Knowledge and that you participate fully in your current stage of development. You do not need to constantly aggravate your mind in order to progress in the most direct manner.</p>
<p>正因如此，我们希望正在经历这种快速成长的人们能够对他们自己和他人非常仁慈、耐心和体贴。你会发现，你的老师们对你非常温柔和耐心。他们并不关心你是否能够立刻领会一切。他们只关心你不要破坏你获得内识的机会，并充分参与到你当前的发展阶段。你无需为了以最直接的方式进步而不断地加重你的心灵。</p>
<p>Your neighbors in the Greater Community can only be appreciated and understood through Knowledge and intrinsic relationship. Here you will not care what kind of technology they have. You will not care what they look like. You will only care about your experience of being with them. You have friends and you have adversaries in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>你们在大社区中的邻居，只有通过内识和固有关系才能被欣赏和理解。在这里，你不会在意他们拥有什么样的科技。你不会在意他们长什么样。你只会在意你与他们相处的体验。在大社区中，你们有朋友，也有对手。</p>
<p>Your people are very self-preoccupied with human life, human values, human organizations, human gods, human religious paths and human everything. Yet you must become wise and use Knowledge and not be bedazzled by new, grand experiences. The man and woman of Knowledge are not preoccupied with what things look like. They are only concerned with the task at hand.</p>
<p>你们的人民非常自我为中心全神贯注于人类的生命、人类的价值、人类的组织、人类的神、人类的宗教道路以及人类的一切。然而，你必须变得明智并运用内识，而不是像电影中那样被新的、宏大的经历所迷惑。拥有内识的男女不关注事物的表象。他们只关心眼前的任务。</p>
<p>Your Spiritual Family exists in this world and in other worlds. They are not all humankind. You have a human family that raises you in the world, but you have a Spiritual Family that raises you in life. This Family is not all humankind. You are not entirely human. You belong to a Greater Reality. Being a human is not enough. You are not entirely a human being. When you have this perspective, you will know how to serve people because you will not be trapped in their identity dilemma.</p>
<p>你的精神家庭存在于这个世界，也存在于其他世界。他们并非全是人类。你有一个人类家庭，在世界中养育你，但你也有一个在生命中养育你的精神家庭。这个家庭并非全是人类。你并非完全是人类。你属于一个更伟大的现实。仅仅作为一个人是不够的。你并非完全是一个人类存在。当你拥有这种视角时，你将知道如何为人们服务，因为你不会被困在他们身份的困境中。</p>
<p>God wishes to make God’s Presence manifest in the physical. Yet, God can only do this through the vehicles that exist here. That is the nature of things. God has given this world everything it needs. Now you must use what has been given. God has given this world purpose. God has given this world evolution. God has given this world spiritual assistance of tremendous magnitude. God has planted purpose within you. God has given you life. God has given you Knowledge so that you may fulfill your part in this world at this time.</p>
<p>上帝希望上帝的存在在物质中得到显现。然而，上帝只能通过这里存在的载体来做这件事。这就是事物的自然。上帝赋予了这个世界它所需要的一切。现在你必须使用已经被赋予的内识。上帝赋予了这个世界目的。上帝赋予了这个世界进化。上帝赋予了这个世界极大的精神援助。上帝已经在你的内心栽种了目的。上帝已经给了你生命。上帝已经给了你内识，以便你能够在这个时间履行你在这个世界上的职责。</p>
